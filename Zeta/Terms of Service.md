Terms Of Use
============

_Last Modified: May 17, 2024_

##### **1\. ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE**

These Terms of Use, together with any documents expressly incorporated by reference (collectively, this “Agreement”), form a binding legal agreement between Zeta Help Inc. (“Zeta,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you that governs your access to and use of our website at [http://www.askzeta.com](http://www.askzeta.com/) and any content, functionality or services available through our website (collectively, the “Website” or “Zeta Website”), as well as mobile apps we o er through the Apple Store and Google Play (collectively, the “Applications” or “Zeta Applications” and together with the Website, the “Services”), as a visitor or registered user or otherwise.

Please carefully read these Terms of Use and any documents referenced herein before you use any of the Services. By using, accessing or installing the Services, or by clicking to accept or agree to these Terms of Use when the option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and any documents expressly incorporated herein, including, without limitation, our Privacy Policy, available at [http://www.askzeta.com/privacy-policy](http://www.askzeta.com/privacy-policy) , incorporated herein by reference.

Further, by using, accessing or installing the Services, or by clicking to accept or agree to these Terms of Use when the option is made available to you, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the Agreement agreeing to this Agreement, and you represent that you (i) are eighteen (18) years of age or older; (ii) have not previously been suspended, removed or deactivated from the Services; (iii) are a legal resident of the United States _or_ Canada.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: This Agreement contains an arbitration provision and a waiver of class action rights as set forth in Section 24 below – subject to the opportunity of the user to opt out of arbitration as set forth therein. By agreeing to arbitration, each party waives its rights to have any dispute heard in court by a judge or jury. By agreeing to waive class action rights, each party agrees to assert claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.

This Agreement is effective as of the time you accept the Agreement or first download, install, access, or use the Services, whichever is earlier.

For certain Services, separately provided guidelines, rules or terms and conditions may apply in addition to this Agreement (collectively, “Additional Terms”). Such Additional Terms are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Additional Terms, this Agreement shall control unless the Additional Terms expressly provide otherwise.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THE ZETA WEBSITE, ZETA APPLICATIONS OR ANY OF THE FEATURES CONTAINED THEREIN.

##### **2\. OVERVIEW OF SERVICES**

The Services collectively referred to in this Agreement include:

_Zeta Website_. The Zeta Website includes any webpage under the domain [http://www.askzeta.com](http://www.askzeta.com/), and any content, functionality or services ordered by Zeta on our website.

_Zeta App_. Zeta App is a mobile banking app that allows you to access a personal and/or joint deposit account and debit cards that both allow you to transact on that account alone or with your partner (“co-owner”), companions or minors. In addition to these Terms of Use, Zeta App users will be required to enter into a Zeta-Piermont Bank Account Agreement, which also governs the use of Zeta App services.

##### **3\. ELIGIBILITY**

The Services, including our Website, Applications and any features or functionality available therein but excluding Zeta App, are intended solely for users who are 18 years of age or older, and reside in the United States. By creating an online account on the Website or Applications, or by accessing their features, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements. Certain services may be provided to younger individuals who would be subject to additional terms.

##### **4\. ACCESS VIA MOBILE DEVICES AND MINIMUM DEVICE REQUIREMENTS**

You may be able to access and browse our website and our mobile apps via its interactive features through a compatible mobile device. In order to do so, you must have a wireless subscription with a participating carrier or have other network access. For our mobile apps, your mobile device must also meet certain minimum device requirements. These requirements can be found on the Apple or Google Play store when you download the mobile apps. You are solely responsible for all service fees and charges from your carrier or network provider, as well as any necessary equipment or software requirements, associated with accessing our website and any of its interactive features through your mobile device.

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Zeta.

Zeta is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

The Zeta App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Zeta App won’t work properly or at all.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Zeta will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Zeta cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Zeta cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Zeta cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Zeta’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Zeta accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The Zeta App is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Zeta does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

_TEXT MESSAGES & VERIFICATIONS_

In order to use Zeta’s services, you must provide and verify your email and cellular phone number (or other text message address) to us, and you must expressly consent to receive text messages or emails relating to the Services at that number or address. By providing us with a telephone number for a cellular phone or other wireless device, you agree to receive autodialed and pre-recorded, non-marketing, service-related text messages from or on behalf of Zeta at the phone number provided. You further consent to receiving autodialed and pre-recorded text messages from or on behalf of Zeta at the number provided for marketing or promotional purposes. You understand that consent to marketing-related messages is not a condition of using the Services. To stop receiving marketing-related messages, you may reply STOP to any marketing-related text message you receive from Zeta. After you text “STOP” to us, we will send you a text to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive text messages from us. 

You are responsible for any messaging or data fees you may be charged by your wireless carrier for receiving SMS notifications.

_PUSH NOTIFICATIONS_

By agreeing to this Agreement, you agree to receive push notifications from us. You can opt out of receiving push notifications through your device settings. Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Services.

##### **5\. ZETA IS NOT A REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISOR; ZETA DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE**

Zeta is NOT a registered investment adviser. We are not providing investment advisory services to you through the content we provide on our website or in the use of our online tool.

Zeta’s Services and content provided via the Services do not constitute specific tax or legal advice, and may not be relied on for purposes of legal compliance.

To see a full schedule of our fees, please visit www.askzeta.com/fees.

##### **20\. ZETA+**

Zeta+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to the following: 

* Up to 4 open accounts. These accounts can include any combination of personal checking or joint checking accounts. 
    
* Up to 4 unique team members. Currently, team members are only able to be co-owners as defined in the [Zeta-Piermont Account Agreement](https://www.askzeta.com/zeta-piermont-account-agreement) (https://www.askzeta.com/zeta-piermont-account-agreement).
    
* Access to premium features:
    
    * _Cards+:_ As part of this premium feature, you have access to additional virtual cards and custom controls for those cards.
        
    * _Automation+_: As part of this premium feature, you have the ability to set up automations that allow you to program your finances based on specific rules.
        

We charge a monthly or yearly fee (the “Subscription Fee”) for “Zeta+”. Zeta is not responsible for any third-party fees that may be incurred as a result of using Zeta+. 

We may also charge for other Zeta services you choose to utilize outside of Zeta+ as described in our fee schedule. The current amount of your Subscription Fee is disclosed in the App. We may debit the Subscription Fee on a monthly or annual basis from your Zeta Account pursuant to your ACH authorization. When paid monthly, the Subscription Fee is non-refundable, except as otherwise required by applicable law. We may change the amount, frequency, and debit date of the Subscription Fee from time to time in our sole discretion. We will notify you in advance of any change to the Subscription Fee by sending you an email, by posting a notice on the Website and the Application, and/or by any other method permitted by applicable law. By accessing or using the Services after any change to the Subscription Fee takes effect, you agree to pay the Subscription Fee, as modified.

1. Zeta+ debit authorization. You authorize Zeta to debit your Zeta account on or after your due date for the Zeta+ subscription (“Subscription Payment”) until you cancel your subscription or close your Zeta account. If your Zeta bank account has insufficient funds to pay for your Subscription Payment, you also authorize Zeta to debit any other bank accounts you linked to Zeta, or any other Zeta accounts, to pay for your Subscription Payment. You further authorize Zeta to initiate credit and debit entries to correct any erroneous credits or debits to any bank accounts used for your Subscription Payment. You can view your linked accounts in the Zeta App.
    
2. Your Zeta+ Subscription. Monthly subscriptions renew every month on the subscription date (found in-app). Annual subscriptions renew each year on the subscription date. If a subscription payment fails for an annual plan, Zeta may update the subscription to a monthly subscription.
    
3. Cancellation. You may cancel your Zeta+ subscription at any time in multiple ways:
    

* In the app, going to Zeta+ → Update plan
    
* In the app, message your Concierge directly
    
* E-mailing support@askzeta.com
    

You must cancel your subscription at least three (3) business days before the scheduled date of your Zeta+ Subscription Fee. To cancel your Zeta+ Subscription, you must have no more than 3 open accounts with no more than 3 total members.

Upon cancellation, users will retain access to the subscription services until their current billing cycle ends. The subscription will not renew for the following month. There are no refunds for monthly subscriptions. 

For annual subscriptions, you will receive a prorated refund if you cancel within the first eight months of your subscription. The refund will be calculated based on the months subscribed and the rate applied will be the equivalent of our monthly subscription fee. The formula for calculating the refund amount is as follows:

Refund Amount = Yearly Subscription Fee - (Months Subscribed × Monthly Subscription Fee)

Zeta may cancel or suspend any Zeta+ subscriptions you have purchased if you fail to pay the applicable subscription payment on time. If you cancel, you will lose the benefits associated with your Zeta+ subscription, including Automation+ and Cards+.

If applicable, please allow 5 business days for refunds to be processed.

**21\. ZETA PAY**

Description of Service. Zeta Pay (“Zeta Pay Service”) allows you to send funds or receive funds for peer-to-peer personal, non-commercial purposes between Eligible Zeta Account holders.

_General._ Once you have opened a Zeta Account and have funds available, you will be able to send funds using the Zeta Pay Service. Note that your Zeta Balance will be an “Eligible Zeta Account” only if your Zeta Account is funded and is not locked. If you have not funded your Zeta Account or have a currently locked Zeta Account, you will not be able to use your Zeta Account balance to send funds using the Zeta Pay Service. As a party initiating a transfer (“Sender”), you will send funds to your selected recipient (“Recipient”) by designating the Recipient and the transfer amount to us (a “Payment Instruction”).

_Zeta Tag._ Zeta will auto-create a Zeta Tag that allows you to send and receive funds securely using Zeta Pay. You will need to have an Eligible Zeta Personal Account to generate a Zeta Tag. You can choose to make your Zeta Tag private if you prefer not to participate in the Zeta Pay Service. Zeta may choose to remove access to your Zeta Tag for any reason under our sole discretion.

_Sending Funds._ You will be able to send funds using our Zeta Pay Service service if you have an Eligible Zeta Account. You authorize us to use your account balance to move funds on your behalf. We will not be responsible for certain incomplete transactions, as described here.

_Authorization._ By initiating each Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your selected Zeta Account and to send those funds to your designated Recipient (a “P2P Payment”) immediately upon your request. You understand and agree that when you initiate a P2P Payment Instruction, processing will begin, and funds will leave your Zeta Account as early as the moment you initiate the Payment Instruction.

_Our Liability._ We shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete a P2P Payment Instruction because of inaccurate or insufficient Payment Instructions.

_Funding Sources Used for Payments Made Through the Service._ You may use any Zeta Account that has a sufficient balance to fund Zeta Pay Service payments. If you have more than one Eligible Zeta Account, you will be asked to confirm which account balance you want to use when creating a Payment Instruction. Zeta reserves the right to limit which accounts constitute an Eligible Zeta Account. We also reserve the right to remove access to the Zeta Pay Service for an Eligible Zeta Account if and when needed.

_Requesting Funds._ You may also request funds to be transferred to you through the Zeta Pay Service by designating the amount of funds requested and your selected Sender (a “Zeta Request”). If the Sender approves your Zeta Request, your Zeta Request will become the Sender’s Payment Instructions and be processed as described in these Zeta Terms. You are only able to request funds from an existing Zeta user.

_Receiving Funds._ Any P2P Payment you receive via the Zeta Pay Service will be stored in your Zeta Account.

_Zeta Pay Service Payment Amount Limits._ Your Zeta Pay Service payments have limits based on the status of your account. For non-VIP users, you are able to send or receive payments of $500 per day or $1,000 per week. For VIP users, you are able to send or receive payments of $1,000 per day or $2,000 per week. If you’re sending large amounts of money over the thresholds described here, you will need to provide additional verification so that we can make sure you are who you say you are. Zeta may impose other limits on the amount you can send in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any seven (7) day period, subject to some restrictions. We may adjust these limits at any time at our discretion.

_Zeta Pay Service Fees._ Your Zeta Pay Service payments are sent free of charge. We can change these fees in the future. There are currently no fees for sending funds via an Eligible Zeta Account using the Zeta Pay Service payments.

_Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments._ Our ability to stop or cancel a Zeta to Zeta Service Payment Instruction depends on how the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction has begun processing. We are not required to stop, cancel, or recover funds associated with a misdirected Payment Instruction. P2P Payments not claimed by a Recipient fifteen (15) days after the processing has begun will be canceled automatically. We will attempt to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied P2P Payment to your Eligible Zeta Account, as applicable. If we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the P2P Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law.

_Invalid P2P Payments._ If we believe you received a payment that should not have been made for some reason (for example, fraud), you give us permission to reverse that payment. We are not responsible for any payments that you receive, even if you don’t know who sent the payment. If you receive a P2P Payment and we later determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Payment was invalid for any reason, you hereby authorize us to move funds from the applicable Eligible Zeta Account in an amount equal to the P2P Payment. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable in any way for any P2P Payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.

##### **22\.** INSTANT TRANSFERS

In order to transfer funds instantly that you own or have control of at another financial institution to your Account, we use Astra Inc. (“Astra”) to gather data from Authorized Debit Card Accounts you connect to your Account via the Zeta mobile application. By using the Instant Transfers service, you grant to Zeta and Astra the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the financial institution or the authorized debit card account you designate as the holder of the linked funding account for your Account. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Astra in accordance with Astra’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Zeta may remove access for the Instant Transfer feature for any reason without warning. Funds from these types of transfers will not be available until after the funds have been settled.

##### **23\. DISCLAIMERS**

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ZETA HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ZETA PROVIDES NO WARRANTY AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND THAT: (a) THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN, OR THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF, THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE CORRECT, ACCURATE, UP-TO-DATE, OR RELIABLE; (b) THE SERVICES BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (c) THE SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE; (d) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS; OR (e) ANY ERRORS IN THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE CORRECTED.

YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 WHICH PROVIDES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER. AS SUCH, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

##### **24\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ZETA, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR OTHER PERSONNEL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THE SUCH PARTIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, WHERE SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM: (a) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES, (b) ANY PURCHASE OF A THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE BASED ON INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ZETA SERVICES, (c) ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES OR THIRD PARTIES, OR (d) ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AVAILABLE OR ACCESSIBLE VIA THE SERVICES. THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 21 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

##### **25\. INDEMNIFICATION**

You hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Zeta and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, assigns and other personnel from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, fines costs or and expenses of any kind, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way attributable to your use or misuse of the Services or your breach of this Agreement, including but not limited to any data or content that you submit to or make available via the Services.

##### **26\. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

1. _Governing Law._ You and Zeta agree that this Agreement and the resolution of any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its choice or conflicts of laws provisions or rules.
    
2. _Informal Dispute Resolution._ Where possible, we want to address any concerns or issues without needing a formal legal case. Before filing any claim against Zeta, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting support@askzeta.com. We will try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Zeta may bring a formal proceeding.
    
3. _Arbitration._ Any and all Disputes (regardless of basis or theory) shall be resolved by arbitration (except as expressly set forth herein)involving one arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or its successor in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, or other applicable rules as determined by the arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in San Francisco, California in the English language, and, at the request of either party, result in a written statement of the facts and legal reasoning supporting the decision of the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law. Judgement on an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.
    
4. _Costs of Arbitration._ The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, Zeta will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. Each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
    
5. _Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate._ You may decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting support@askzeta.com within 30 days of first accepting this Agreement. Your communication must state that you decline this arbitration agreement, and it must include your first and last name.
    
6. _Exceptions to Arbitration._ Either you or Zeta may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit in any court of competent jurisdiction, solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or infringement of intellectual property rights, without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
    
7. _Waiver of Class and Collective Actions._ To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Zeta agree that (i) ANY DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, THAT ONE PARTY MAY HAVE WITH THE OTHER PARTY, MAY ONLY BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND SHALL BE NOT BE ASSERTED AS A CLASS ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ACTION, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, COURT OR ANY OTHER FORUM; AND (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF. Disputes shall not be joined or consolidated with any other proceeding that involves any claim or controversy of any other party.
    
8. _Choice of Forum._ In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to any Dispute, you and Zeta agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California. Both you and Zeta consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Each party agrees to waive and hereby waives its right to a jury trial.
    
9. _Limitation of Time to File Claims._ Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, each party agrees that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.
    

##### **27\. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

1. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, consisting of these Terms of Use together with the Privacy Policy and any other documents expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Zeta regarding your use of and access to the Services.
    
2. _Amendment._ Except as expressly permitted herein, this Agreement may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties.
    
3. _Assignment._ You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign this Agreement or any of our rights or obligations under this Agreement at any time without notice.
    
4. _Waiver and Severability._ The failure of a party to require performance of any provision by the other party shall not affect the right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given
    
5. _Headings._ The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
