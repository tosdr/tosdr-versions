1\. **How We Collect, Use and Share Personal Information**
==========================================================

A. **Personal Information We Collect**
--------------------------------------

Zeta collects personal information for a variety of purposes, and the kinds of personal information that we collect about you depends on how you use or interact with our Services. (For example, personal information we collect about website visitors is different from the personal information we collect about mobile app users.)

Depending on how you use or interact with our Services, we may collect the following kinds of personal information about you:

* _Personal identifiers, contact and biographical information_. This is personal information such as your name, home address, e-mail address, or telephone number, as well as demographic information, such as gender and date of birth, your photograph, or information about your employment, finances, interests, and activities. (For this kind of information, you’ll know what we collect because we’ll collect it from you directly.)
    
* _Government identification information_. This includes your Social Security number, driver’s license number, or ID numbers from other government documents, and for some Services, we may collect copies of government-issued photo IDs, such as a driver’s license or passport.
    
* _Payment information_. We may collect credit card information or other means of payment, if you use any Services that require payments.
    
* _Financial information_. This includes information about your income, expenses, transactions, or debt, or your credit score and other information from your credit report. If you choose to connect a bank account to Zeta, we will also collect financial account numbers, transaction information, account balances, and other information about your banking activities that you or your bank may make available to us.
    
* _Social media handles_. If you contact us through a social media platform, we may collect your username or social media handle, or other information about you that is available on social media.
    

The information described above is generally collected directly from users of our Services – as when you submit information to us through our website, mobile apps, or other Services that we offer.

In some of the cases described above, we will collect information from third parties – from your bank or other financial services you use, from credit reporting agencies, or through social media sites. We may also collect personal information about you from an identity verification service, if you request Services that require us to confirm your identity, and if your traditional ID (such as a driver’s license) cannot be verified, or if there are other issues confirming your identity.

In addition to the personal information described above, we also collect information automatically, whenever any person visits our website or uses our other Services. This automated technical information, which may also be personal information about you, includes:

* _Technical and usage information__._ When you visit and navigate through the Zeta website, mobile apps or other Services, we automatically collect technical and usage information about your computer or device, and your activities when you interact with our Services, such as your IP address, device identifiers, browser type, geolocation information, operating system, web pages that visit before and after accessing Zeta webpages, the specific Zeta webpages, links, or features you viewed or used and the times those were viewed or used, and other usage statistics and “clickstream” data.
    
* _Data collected through cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies__._ A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer or device when you visit our website or other Services. We use cookies to identify you or your device to our Services, and for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation, to perform analytics, and to personalize your experience while visiting the website. We also use pixel tags, which are small files embedded in webpages and email. We use pixel tags to track whether users visit specific pages of the website, downloaded a particular document, or opened a Zeta email.

    * Zeta supports information changes to be handled directly through the Zeta App.
        
    * All other information can be changed directly on your profile by emailing us at support@askzeta.com.
        

We may require additional documentation to help identify you before we are able to make personal information changes.

=============================================

We take information security seriously, and we have implemented an information security program that includes physical, technical, and procedural safeguards that are reasonably designed to protect the personal information that we collect or that you may provide to us.

We restrict access to personal information to only authorized employees for permitted business purposes, and we require our third-party service providers to protect your personal information and use it exclusively for the purpose of performing certain business functions on our behalf.

However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we take steps to secure your information, we cannot ensure or promise that the information you transmit to us will remain secure.

_You are also responsible for the security of your Zeta account._ You also need to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information too. You should be careful in how you share personal information with others and avoid sending any sensitive personal information through unsecure, unencrypted email. Do not provide your username and password to the Zeta website or apps to others.

If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than 13 years of age, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.

5\. **Internal Data Transfers**

We maintain offices and facilities in the United States, and personal information may be transferred to the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, or country of residence, where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in the state, province, or country you resides.

6\. **Updates to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our information practices. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notification by updating the “Effective Date” date at the top of the Privacy Policy and posting the new Privacy Policy to our website or other Services.
