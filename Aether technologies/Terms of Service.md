Peer-to-Peer Nature
-------------------

Aether App is a peer-to-peer app. Using Aether means that your computer or device shares the content created by users of Aether and other compatible apps available on the Aether network to other participants in the network. It is your responsibility to monitor whether this content shared from your computer or device is in compliance with your local jurisdiction.

Content Policy
--------------

Aether tries to provide a lot of flexibility in what kind of content it can be used for, however, there are certain kinds of content that are legally problematic. Following types of content are not allowed:

* Illegal content
* Involuntary pornography
* Sexual or suggestive content involving minors
* Content that encourages or incites violence
* Content that threatens, or encourages others to do so
* Content that is personal and confidential information
* Content that uses Aether to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services
* Content that is spam

### Illegal content

Do not use Aether for illegal content.

### Involuntary pornography

Do not disseminate images, video, depicting any person in any act of sexual conduct, apparently created or published without their explicit permission.

This applies even if a person is fully clothed, and/or in public. Images of body parts recontextualised in a salacious manner (e.g. ‘Upskirt’, ‘Creepshots’) also fall under this restriction.

### Sexual or suggestive content involving minors

Aether does not allow any sexual or suggestive content, involving minors, or person(s) who appear to be minors, whether be it videos, photos, 3D renderings, animation, or in any other form.

### Content that encourages or incites violence

Do not post content that encourages violence or physical harm against other people, against self, or against animals.

### Content that threatens or encourages others to do so

Do not post content that can make a reasonable person conclude that he or she is under the threat of physical harm.

### Content that is personal and confidential information

Don’t post someone else’s personal information online. (e.g. ‘Doxxing’) Public figures can sometimes be an exception to this rule depending on the context. As an example, if you’re posting the contact email, of your local representative, that is fine, if you’re posting his or her home address, or garage PIN code, it is not.

### Content that uses Aether to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services

Aether is not intended to be a marketplace.

Specifically, using Aether to seek, buy, sell, or otherwise facilitate transactions of these types of items is not allowed:

* Firearms, ammunition or explosives of any kind, or instructions to make them, whether be it written, in computer code (e.g. 3D printing files)
    
* Drugs, Alcohol, Tobacco or Tobacco products, whether be it of organic or synthetic origin. (e.g. e-cigarettes)
    
* Paid services involving physical sexual contact (e.g. prostitution)
    
* Stolen goods
    
* Personal information
    
* Counterfeit items, documents or currency
    
* Scams, and otherwise fraudulent services
    

### Content that is spam

Don’t spam Aether.

Behavior Policy
---------------

### Do not engage in vote manipulation

Do not create multiple accounts with the purpose of being able to vote multiple times on the same content or in the same moderator election cycle.

Creating multiple accounts to post in different communities is okay, so long as you don’t vote on content or people twice.

### Do not break Aether

Aether is a commons that works with the collaboration and participation of all its users. Don’t break it, or do anything that interferes with its normal use. By way of example, and not as a limitation, do not post base64 encoded images (or similar) in text form.

White-hat penetration testing and security research are exceptions to this rule, as long as responsible disclosure policies are followed.

The arbitrator’s award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction.

This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.

Class Action Waiver
-------------------

Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER.
