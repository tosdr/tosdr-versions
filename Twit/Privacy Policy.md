We will retain and use your Personally Identifiable Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

TWiT LLC will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter time, except when it is used to strengthen the security or improve the TWiT Services’ functionality. We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

Transfer of Data
----------------

Your information, including Personally Identifiable Information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction.

If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personally Identifiable Information, to the United States and process it there.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

TWiT LLC will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personally Identifiable Information will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

Disclosure of Data

Your Data Protection Rights Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. TWiT LLC aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personally Identifiable Information.

In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:

* **The right to access, update or delete the information we have on you.** As we do not provide user accounts or profiles with the TWiT Core Services, you can only access, update or request deletion of your Personally Identifiable Information by contacting us to assist you.

You may be required to provide proof of ownership of an IP address from the relevant ISP at each time of use for each removal if you wish us to remove IP address information from our records. This is to protect the privacy of other users information as multiple users can share IP addresses.

However, IP address data is only collected for as long as necessary for the TWiT Services’ security, and access to the IP information is restricted to the appropriate administrators and service providers.

Please note that we may require you to verify your identity via postal mail for your data security and protection.
