---------

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, through our websites, mobile applications, games that we operate, and any other services or interfaces owned or controlled by Yuga Labs that link to this Privacy Policy (each a “_**Service**_” and together, the “_**Services**_”). For the avoidance of doubt, Yuga Labs does not control the blockchain protocol (“_**Protocol**_”) on which various fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (“_**NFTs**_”) are tradable or useable and cannot control activity and data on the Protocol, the validation of transactions on the Protocol, or use of the Protocol.

2\. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
---------------------------------

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you as required by applicable law. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Yuga Labs is protecting your information. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you continue to use our Services after the new Privacy Policy takes effect.

We may collect the following personal information that you provide to us.

**Account Creation.** We may collect personal information when you create an account with us or our service providers (e.g., Shopify), such as name, phone number, time zone, and email address. We may also collect additional personal information, such as your shipping address if you purchase merchandise from us.

**Purchases, Wallet and Transaction Information.** In order to engage in certain transactions or purchases on the Services, you may need to provide us or our third-party payment processors with your payment information and allow us to connect to your digital wallet by providing us with your public wallet address. We will never ask you or collect your private keys. We do not directly collect or store any payment card information entered through our Services or access your digital wallet, but we may receive from our third-party payment processing providers information associated with your payment card information (e.g., your billing details). We may also collect your name, the name of the recipient, email address, the currency and the date as part of the transactions taking place on the Services.

**Supplemental Identity Verification Information.** In order to support Yuga’s legal and regulatory compliance efforts, Yuga may engage third-party identity verification vendors (such as Quadrata and Persona) in order to verify your identity. These vendors may ask you to submit or request access to your mobile device’s camera to collect photographs and/or videos, government-issued identity documents, e.g. passport, driver’s license, or state identification card, Social Security number, employment information (e.g. company name), or proof of residency, including visa information, and may also perform a live facial scan and capture other biometric information generated based on photos or videos.

Any collection of biometric information or identifiers is handled by our vendors, and we do not collect, access or store any biometric information or identifiers through our Services. We may receive the results of identity verification checks from our vendors, but these results do not contain any biometric information or identifiers. For more information about Quadrata’s or Persona’s collection, process, and retention of your personal information (including biometric information and identifiers, please review their respective policies: [https://quadrata.com/privacy](https://quadrata.com/privacy) and [https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy).

Any personal information you provide on the public sections of these features will be considered “_**public**_,” (the “_**User Content**_”) unless otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to other users.

**Surveys.** We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include personal information.

We may disclose your information to third parties for a variety of business purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or asset transfer, as described below.

### A. Disclosures to Provide our Services

The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information are described below.

**Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain.** Transactions involving our NFTs will be conducted on the relevant Protocol. Information about your transfers will be provided to the blockchain and may be accessible to third parties due to the public nature of the blockchain. Because entries to the blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the blockchain could possibly be used to identify you, or information about you. Please note that once your information is uploaded onto or otherwise recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be deleted.

**Other Users of the Services and Parties You Transact With.** Some of your personal information may be visible to other users of the Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts of the contracts or on a user profile). In addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to share some of your personal information with the party that you are transacting with.

**Third Party Websites and Applications.** You may choose to share personal information or interact with third-party websites and/or third-party applications, including, but not limited to, third-party electronic wallet extensions. Once your personal information has been shared with a third-party website or a third-party application, it will also be subject to such third party’s privacy policy. We encourage you to closely read each third-party website or third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party websites’ or the third­-party applications’ processing of your personal information.

**Service Providers.** We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers who use that information to help us provide our Services. This includes service providers that provide us with IT support, hosting, Game Usage Information, customer service, and related services.

### B. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others

We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.

### C. Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers

If we transfer personal information which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, we will use a valid data transfer mechanism to ensure that your personal information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

9\. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
