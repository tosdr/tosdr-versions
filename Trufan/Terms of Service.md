### 2\. **THE PLATFORM & SERVICES**

2.1 Summary. In a nutshell, the Platform is an online platform that provides eligible brands, influencers, and other qualified partners (collectively, “Hosts” and each a “Host”) the ability to create, administer, and sponsor sweepstakes (also known as promotional prize draws)  (“Sweepstakes”) and also provides eligible users of the Platform (each such user of the Platform, a “User”) the ability to enter into those Sweepstakes with a chance to win prizes and experiences from the Hosts who are sponsoring the Sweepstakes.

2.2 Participation. In summary, to participate in a Sweepstakes as an entrant, Users must:

a) Login to the Platform with  your login credentials from certain approved social media platforms;

b) accept and comply with these Terms and the applicable official Sweepstakes rules (the “Sweepstakes Rules”); and

c) use one of the entry methods posted on the applicable Sweepstakes page, such as:

i) a social engagement entry method;

ii) redemption of Secret Codes (defined below);

iii) our Free Alternative Method of Entry, if applicable;

iv) making a donation (a “**Donation**”) through our Platform to the Host associated with the Sweepstakes or a third-party (a “**Selected Recipient**”) selected by such Host (e.g. a charity); or

v) such other entry method as specified on the applicable Sweepstakes page.

The above are just examples of some of the many ways you may be able to enter into a Sweepstakes. Actual Sweepstakes may have differing entry methods. You can find out more information about entry methods by visiting the Sweepstakes’ corresponding webpage.

This summary is subject to the Sweepstakes Rules. For full instructions and rules on how to participate in a Sweepstakes, please read and comply with the Sweepstakes Rules which you can find posted on our Platform.

NO PURCHASE NECESSARY: To be clear, you do not need to make a Donation, pay money, or pay other consideration (a fancy legal term) to be an entrant in or win a Sweepstakes, but the Hosts and Selected Recipients do appreciate the Donations. For more information about the Sweepstakes, see the Sweepstakes section of these Terms below. For more information about Donations, see section 7 below. To use our Free Alternative Method of Entry, if applicable, please follow the instructions on our Platform or in the Sweepstakes Rules.

Donations are not an entry-fee for Sweepstakes, but are instead a voluntary donation to the applicable Host or Selected Recipient made without any expectation of return from the Host, Selected Recipient, Trufan.io, or any other entity. Trufan.io, Hosts, and Selected Recipients are not obligated to provide any services, products, or otherwise in exchange for Donations made.  

2.3 Services. Our Platform makes available numerous services, functionalities, and features (collectively, the “**Services**”).  Some of those Services are made available only to Hosts and others are available to all Users, subject to certain conditions such as payment of fees. If you want access to a Service and you are eligible to receive it (for example, by being a Host), you may request such Service on the Platform via the applicable online order form for such Service. From time to time, we may also agree in writing to provide you with Services. Our provision of, and your access to, our Services is subject to us agreeing in writing to provide them to you. Additionally, all Services are subject to these Terms. You can find out more about each Service on its order form or elsewhere on our Platform.

2.4 Third-Party Services. Some Services made available on our Platform are provided by third-parties (“**Third-Party Services**”). We do not control Third-Party Services and have no liability for them. Your purchase of Third-Party Services may be subject to terms and conditions which differ from those contained in these Terms, including, without limitation, refund policies. You are responsible for reading and understanding the terms and conditions which apply to any Third-Party Services you purchase or use.

2.5 Disclaimer. TRUFAN.IO DOES NOT ADMINISTER, ENDORSE, OR SPONSOR ANY SWEEPSTAKES OR THE CONTENT OF ANY SWEEPSTAKES WHICH IS MADE AVAILABLE ON OUR PLATFORM UNLESS WE STATE OTHERWISE.

2.6 Social Media Login. You acknowledge and agree than when you login to the Platform with your social media login credentials, you authorize us to collect, use, and disclose information from your social media account in accordance with our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.joinsurf.com/giveaways/privacy-policy).

### 3\. **SWEEPSTAKES**

3.1 Contest/Sweepstakes Creation. Subject to compliance with these Terms, eligible Hosts may create Sweepstakes by using the contest creation form (“**Contest Creation Form**”) on the Platform (such Host, a “**Sponsor**”). Access to certain Sweepstakes functionalities and features may require payment of a one-time fee or a recurring paid subscription. You can find out more information about these functionalities and features and the prices for them by visiting our Website.  After a Sponsor completes and submits the Contest Creation Form, the Platform will generate Sweepstakes Rules based on the information submitted by the Sponsor’s into the Contest Creation Form.

3.2 TRUFAN Administered Sweepstakes. From time to time, Trufan.io may administer Sweepstakes on behalf of Hosts (also a “Sponsor”). However, even where we are the Sweepstakes administrator, the Sponsor remains solely responsible and liable for delivering the Prize to the winner of their Sweepstakes (the “Winner”). You can confirm if we are administering a Sweepstakes by reading such Sweepstakes’ Sweepstakes Rules.

3.3 Responsibilities of Sponsor. If you are a Sponsor, you agree you are bound by the applicable Sweepstakes Rules and further acknowledge and agree that you are obligated to deliver the Prize (defined below) connected to your Sweepstakes in accordance with the terms of the applicable Sweepstakes Rules. Sponsors agree that they are solely liable for the failure to deliver any Prize in accordance with their Sweepstakes.

3.4 Restricted Participation.

a) Locations. You are prohibited from creating or participating in a Sweepstakes if you reside in the Canadian Province of Quebec or Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands or other U.S. territories, or any other jurisdiction where participation in or operation of sweepstakes, promotional prize draws, or promotional contests is unlawful.

b) Age. You are prohibited from participating in a Sweepstakes if you are under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction but are thirteen or older, you may not participate in a Sweepstakes unless you have received parental or legal guardian consent and in no event may you create or sponsor a Sweepstakes.

You acknowledge and agree that depending on your age, you may not be eligible to participate in certain Sweepstakes. Sponsors and Trufan.io both reserve the right to set age restrictions and ban or disqualify any person from any Sweepstakes if either the Sponsor or Trufan.io believe, in either of their sole and arbitrary discretion, that such person has not met the age threshold restriction for such Sweepstakes. Violation of age restrictions may result in suspension or deletion of your Account.  

3.5 Restricted Territories. If you are a Sponsor, you agree that you will not make available or promote your Sweepstakes in the Canadian Province of Quebec or Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands or other U.S. territories. You further agree that you will not make available or promote your Sweepstakes in the U.S. State of Florida unless your Sweepstakes complies with Florida Statutes Section 849.094, or in the U.S. State of New York unless your Sweepstakes complies with New York State General Business Law Section 369-e, both of which in certain circumstances require registration of the Sweepstakes in advance, a form of financial security for offered prizes, and certification of winners to the state.

3.6 Legal Restrictions and Minimum Age. Sponsors may set age restrictions and other restrictions on entry for their Sweepstakes. If you are a Sponsor, you agree to ensure, and are solely responsible for ensuring, that your Sweepstakes have appropriate age restrictions on entry and other restrictions as required by law. For example, if a prize is alcohol, the Sweepstakes must restrict entry from persons under the drinking age in such persons’ jurisdiction and must also restrict entry from persons where it is unlawful to distribute alcohol without legal authorization. The foregoing is not a complete list of legal obligations with respect to alcohol and is provided for illustrative purposes only.

Additionally, Sponsors must flag any mature content or prizes relating to a Sweepstakes (for example, mature video games or prizes involving alcohol) and ensure such content or prizes are not marketed or made available to persons unless they are of lawful age to view or receive such content or prize, in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Sweepstakes is offered. Sponsors are solely responsible for apprising themselves of the laws of the jurisdictions in which they offer their Sweepstakes. In no event will any information made available from Trufan.io be deemed legal advice.

3.7 Prize. When creating a Sweepstakes, the Sponsor must disclose to Trufan.io a description (“**Prize Description**”) of the Sweepstakes’ prize (“**Prize**”) and its approximate retail value (“**Value**”). Sponsor’s must not offer a Prize with a Value greater than $5,000 USD.  By creating a Sweepstakes, Sponsors represent and warrant to Trufan.io and all participants in the Sweepstakes that the Prize Description and Value are accurate. Prizes must be lawful in all jurisdictions where they are offered. In no event may a Prize be a weapon or a controlled substance.

3.8 Sponsorship of Sweepstakes. You acknowledge and agree that the Sponsor is the sponsor of the Sweepstakes created by that Sponsor. Among other things, this means that the Sponsor is solely responsible and liable for: (a) except as provided in Section 3.2, administration of the Sweepstakes; (b) delivery of the Prize to the Winner; and (c) any shipping and handling expenses related to the delivery of the Prize.

3.9 Delivery of Prize. If you are a Sponsor, you must promptly deliver the Prize to the winner of your Sweepstakes, and in all cases no later than 30 days after the winner of the Sweepstakes has been selected.

3.10 Acceptance of Sweepstakes Rules. By entering any Sweepstakes, you agree with the Sweepstakes Rules for such Sweepstakes. Your participation in a Sweepstakes is subject to the applicable Sweepstakes Rules.

3.11 Forfeiture of Prize. If you are a Winner and you are not available upon the awarding of the Prize, the Prize may be forfeited in accordance with the Sweepstakes Rules.

3.12 Conflicts. If these Terms are inconsistent with or conflict with the Sweepstakes Rules, the Sweepstakes Rules prevail.

3.13 Sponsor Responsibility for Legal Compliance. You agree that the Sponsor is solely responsible for ensuring that their Sweepstakes is compliant with all applicable laws, regulations, by-laws, rules, and orders in the jurisdictions in which the Sweepstakes is being made available. For example, certain US states require that sweepstakes sponsors register sweepstakes in advance, post a form of financial security for offered prizes, and certify winners to the state. You agree that Trufan.io, Twitch Interactive, Inc., YouTube LLC, Microsoft Corporation, Meta Inc., Discord Inc., and Twitter, Inc. are not responsible or liable for any legal non-compliance by Sponsors, except where such entity is the Sponsor.

3.14 Your Responsibility for Compliance. You agree that it is your responsibility to comply with all applicable terms of services, terms of use, rules, guidelines, or other contractual obligations when promoting a Sweepstakes on any third party website, social network, or other platform (“**Third Party Rules**”). For example, when promoting a Sweepstakes on Twitch.tv, you must comply with section 8(d) of Twitch.tv’s Terms of Service, which, among other things, requires that you display or read out loud the following statement when a Sweepstakes is on your Twitch.tv channel:

_“This is a promotion by \[Sponsor’s name\]. Twitch does not sponsor or endorse \[Sponsor’s name’s\] promotion and is not responsible for this promotion.”_        

You agree that Trufan.io is not liable for any loss you suffer resulting from non-compliance with any  Third Party Rules.

3.15 Responsibility for Legal Compliance. You are responsible for ensuring that your participation in or operation of a Sweepstakes (whether as an entrant, a Sponsor, or otherwise) is compliant with all applicable laws, regulations, by-laws, rules, and orders, including, without limitation, any prize notification requirements.

3.16 Void. Sweepstakes are void where prohibited by applicable law.

3.17 Prohibited Parties. Trufan.io’s directors, officers, employees, and agents, their respective immediate family members (including, without limitation, spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, and siblings) and any other person residing in the household of any of the foregoing persons are prohibited from participating in any Sweepstakes; except that Trufan.io’s directors, officers, employees, and agents may create, sponsor, or administer Sweepstakes on the Platform in the performance of their duties to Trufan.io.

3.18 Clarification of Terminology. You acknowledge that although we use the word “contest” on our Platform, we are referring to Sweepstakes as defined in these Terms. Additionally, you acknowledge that when we refer to a “contest” on the Platform or Sweepstakes in these Terms, such activity may legally or colloquially be known as a contest, sweepstakes, or promotional prize draw depending on the particular Sweepstakes Rules and the jurisdiction in which it is occurring.

3.19 Disclaimer. Trufan.io is not liable or responsible for how Sponsor’s collect, use, maintain, or disclose information you provide to Sponsors.

3.20 Taxes. You are responsible for all tax law compliance related to your operation of or participation in a Sweepstakes. If you are a winner, you agree to cooperate with the Sponsor’s reasonable requests in connection with tax filings and other tax law compliance related to your receipt of a Prize.

3.21 Cancelled Sweepstakes. Donations are not refundable in the event of a cancelled or suspended Sweepstakes. Any dispute or controversy regarding Donations that arises due to a cancelled or suspended Sweepstakes is solely between the Sponsor of such Sweepstakes and any Users who entered such Sweepstakes.

3.22 Cancelled Sweepstakes Indemnification. If you are a Sponsor of a cancelled Sweepstakes, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Trufan.io and its Representatives from and against any and all claims, proceedings, suits, disputes, demands, threats, actions, obligations, liabilities, costs (including legal and accounting fees), damages, losses, penalties, fees, expenses, and injuries arising or resulting from the cancelled Sweepstakes or any demand or claim for a refund of Donations related to your cancelled Sweepstakes.

3.23 Sponsor Initiated Bans. Sponsors may permanently or temporarily ban any particular User from all Sweepstakes created by that Sponsor if, in the reasonable opinion of the Sponsor, such User: (a) has violated the Sweepstakes Rules or these Terms; or (b) has acted or is acting in an offensive, abusive, obnoxious, racist, sexist, harassing, or belligerent manner, causing a disturbance, or otherwise negatively affecting the goodwill or reputation of Sponsor, Twitch, or Trufan.io. In such a circumstance, until the ban is lifted, the banned User is prohibited from entering any Sweepstakes created by the Sponsor who banned the User from their Sweepstakes.

3.24 Trufan.io Initiated Bans. Trufan.io may permanently or temporarily ban any User from any or all Sweepstakes in Trufan.io’s sole arbitrary discretion. In such a circumstance, until the ban is lifted, the banned User is prohibited from entering any Sweepstakes from which they have been banned.

3.25 Secret Codes. In some circumstances, you may be able to enter a Sweepstakes by redeeming a Secret Code. “Secret Codes” are essentially access codes that provide you with a certain number of entries into a Sweepstakes. Secret Codes may be made available from select third party partners or Trufan.io from time to time. Secret Codes have no cash value and are not intended for resale. Users and Sponsors are prohibited from selling or otherwise transferring Secret Codes to any person. Secret Codes may not be redeemed more than once. You are prohibited from using any unauthorized means to generate, crack, or discover Secret Codes.

3.26 Good Faith. Each Sponsor must act honestly and in good faith when exercising any discretion under the Sweepstakes Rules.

### 6\. **INSTANT REWARDS**

6.1 Occasionally the Platform may provide you with functionality through which the first set number of users taking certain actions such as liking a social media post (a **“Qualifying Engagement**”) may receive certain rewards, such as codes allowing the users to access a software suite offered by one of our partners (collectively “**Instant Rewards**”). More detail regarding such Instant Rewards and the Qualifying Engagements necessary to obtain them will be provided on the applicable Instant Reward page on the Website.

6.2 In order to receive a Instant Reward you must:

1. have a valid Account in good standing and login to the Platform with your login credentials from certain approved social media platforms;
2. be the first of a set number of Users set out on the applicable Instant Reward page to perform a Qualifying Engagement, and otherwise comply with any other requirements perform a Qualifying Engagement; and
3. comply with any additional requirements set out on the Instant Reward page.

6.3. To be clear, only the first number of Users to perform a Qualifying Engagement set out in the applicable Instant Rewards page and otherwise comply with the additional requirements set out on the Instant Rewards page, commencing on the date and time the Instant Reward eligibility commences as set out on the applicable Instant Rewards page, shall be eligible to obtain a Instant Reward. Users who are not among the first number of Users to perform the Qualifying Engagement set out on the applicable Instant Rewards page will not be eligible to receive an Instant Reward.

6.4 You do not need to make a Donation, pay money, or pay other consideration (a fancy legal term) to claim an Instant Reward. There is also no element of chance or luck involved in determining whether a User is entitled to receive a Instant Reward (except if such Instant Reward is offered through a Sweepstakes, as further set out in section 6.6 below).

6.5 Instant Rewards will be provided by sending the same to the contact information associated with the User account performing the Qualifying Engagement. You are solely responsible for ensuring the contact information associated with your User Account is correct and up to date in order to receive a Instant Reward, and we will not be responsible for your failure to receive a Instant Reward due to your failure to maintain the contact information associated with your User Account up to date.

6.6 Please note that occasionally our Sweepstakes may offer Instant Rewards in respect to entry into the Sweepstakes. Instant Rewards offered through the Sweepstakes are governed by the applicable Sweepstakes Rules, however all other aspects of the Terms, including the provisions of Section 13 shall apply to Instant Rewards obtained through a Sweepstakes. In the event of any conflict between the Sweepstakes Rules and section 6 of these Terms in respect to any Instant Rewards offered through a Sweepstakes, the terms of the applicable Sweepstakes Rules shall govern.

### **7\. ADVERTISEMENTS, PAID SERVICES, PRODUCTS, & PAYMENTS**

7.1 Advertisements. Advertisements on our Platform respecting products and Services are invitations to you to make offers to purchase products and services and are not offers to sell. A properly-completed order on our Website by you constitutes only your offer to purchase the products or services in your order, even if Trufan.io has processed payment for such offer. Your order will be accepted only if and when Trufan.io sends a purchase confirmation email (“**Confirmation Email**”) to the email address you provided during your registration or order process or as otherwise updated on your Account. If we do not accept your order in whole or in part, we will refund any amounts paid by you to us for the order or part of the order not accepted and no contract will be formed with respect to such order.

7.2 Corrections. Any price offers or advertisements given by Trufan.io will be valid for the period stated on the offer or advertisement, except that Trufan.io reserves the right to reject any sale for any reason, including without limitation for typographical errors, illustrative errors, or a misprint in the price offer or advertisement. In the event of a pricing mistake, we will not be bound by the incorrect price.

7.3 Depictions of Products. Products may differ slightly from how depicted in any illustrations, photography or descriptions on our website. Trufan.io has endeavoured to display as accurately as possible the colours of our products as they appear on our website. However, as the actual colours you see will depend on photographic processes and your screen, Trufan.io cannot guarantee that your screen’s display of any colour will be accurate.

7.4  Charges. Use of certain Services, purchases of products, or entry into a Sweepstakes may result in charges (“**Charges**”) to you, plus applicable taxes. For example, if you enter a Sweepstakes by making a Donation, you will be charged the amount you choose to donate to the Sponsor. We will inform you of the prices for paid Services before you incur the Charge. Different Services may have different fees and payment schedules. When you order or subscribe to a paid Service, or make a Donation, you agree to pay the applicable Charges. Charges might be one-time or recurring, depending on the Service selected. You agree to pay all Charges and applicable taxes without delay.  Unless otherwise specified, payment must be made in full and received by Trufan.io prior to our acceptance of an order for products or Services.

If we, or our third-party payment processor, are unable to verify your payment method, or if it is otherwise invalid or not acceptable, any Service purchased by you may be cancelled or your entry into a Sweepstakes may be disqualified.  You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts related to any failure to properly charge your payment method.

7.7 Donations. You acknowledge and agree that when a Donation is made to a Sponsor or Selected Recipient, a certain percentage of the Donation may be remitted to Trufan.io as a service charge paid by the Sponsor or Selected Recipient for the provision of this Platform and our Services (the “**Service Charge**”). Where applicable, taxes will be collected in connection with the Service Charge.

7.8 Recurring Subscription. If you sign up for a recurring subscription for Services, such subscription will auto-renew successively until cancelled in accordance with these Terms. This means that you will be charged an initial fee on the date you sign up and then thereafter at the commencement of each renewal period on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription. Consequently, you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method the initial fee and then on a recurring basis for your subscription.

7.9 Cancellation. You may cancel a recurring subscription at any time by sending us a cancellation request to info@trufan.io or requesting a cancellation on the platform. Such cancellation will become effective at the end of then-current term of your subscription, provided your request is sent prior to 48 hours of your next billing date. Without 48 hours notice, we cannot guarantee that your request will be processed before your next billing date. Refunds will not be provided to users who fail to provide 48hrs notice of cancellation and are charged for one final billing cycle. Unless otherwise indicated, cancelling one recurring subscription does not cancel your other recurring subscriptions.

7.10 No Refunds. Although you can cancel recurring subscriptions, Trufan.io does not provide refunds or credits (except as described in Sections 7.1 and 7.16).

7.11 Chargebacks. If you charge back any amounts paid by credit card or Paypal, we will charge you an additional $25 and may delete your Account.

7.12 Prices. Prices on our website are expressed in United States Dollars (USD) unless otherwise noted. Pricing and availability may change without notice. If you disagree with the fee change related to a recurring subscription, you can cancel your recurring subscription before the next renewal date.

7.13 Additional Terms May Apply. If the product or service sold has additional terms and conditions, those additional terms and conditions will be provided to you prior to the sale. By ordering such product or service, you agree to the additional terms and conditions.

7.14 Promotional Offers. At our discretion, we may make available certain Services or products at a discount or for free for a trial period (“Promotions”). We reserve the right to modify or cancel these Promotions at any time. If we reasonably determine you have violated the terms applicable to the Promotion, we may charge you the full price for the Service or product that was otherwise subject to the Promotion. At the end of any Promotion, if you have not cancelled the Service which corresponds with the Promotion, you agree that we (or our third-party payment processor) may begin charging you the full price for such Service.

7.15 Limited Quantities. Despite anything to the contrary in these Terms, we may impose a limit on the purchasable quantity of a particular product or service.

7.16 Availability. Delivery of products is subject to availability. If you have paid for a product but it is unavailable, we will notify you of the unavailability and either refund you the purchase price for such product or provide you with a replacement product of equal or greater value.  

7.17 Payment Processor. We use third-party payment processors to process your payments. Your payments will be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of such third-party payment processors. These terms and conditions and privacy policies will be made available to you before you purchase a product or Service or make a Donation.
