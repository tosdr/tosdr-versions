Free trial subscriptions are only available to new subscribers of ClickFunnels and for the limited periods as set out on the Website. Previous subscribers or those subscribers who have already benefited from a free trial subscription to ClickFunnels do not qualify for a further free trial period.  

**ClickFunnels will email a reminder that your trial is ending at least 7 days prior to you being charged. If you do not want to continue your subscription after your free trial comes to an end, you must contact us at least 24 hours before your free trial period ends by submitting a cancellation request to us via our support email address [cf2support@clickfunnels.com](mailto:cf2support@clickfunnels.com), or by canceling your free trial through your Account Dashboard, as detailed [here](https://support.myclickfunnels.com/support/solutions/articles/150000157019). If you do not contact us at least 24 hours before your free trial period ends to cancel, your subscription will automatically continue and the payment card that you provided at the time of enrollment online will be charged the full ClickFunnels monthly membership subscription rate provided at the time of enrollment each month until you cancel.** ClickFunnels can change the monthly membership subscription rate at any time. If the membership subscription rate changes after you subscribe, we will notify you by email and give you an opportunity to cancel.  

If you wish to cancel your ClickFunnels subscription (including subscriptions for services) at any time after a free trial or discounted period ends, you must submit a cancellation request to us via our support email address [cf2support@clickfunnels.com](mailto:cf2support@clickfunnels.com) or through your Account Dashboard, as detailed [here](https://support.myclickfunnels.com/support/solutions/articles/150000157019). For monthly subscriptions (including subscriptions for services), we require at least ten (10) days‚Äô notice of cancellation by email. If you provide such notice less than ten (10) days before the first day of your next subscription month, your credit card may still be charged. You will not be entitled to prorate your last month‚Äôs use, nor will you be entitled to any refund for any payments to ClickFunnels. For annual subscriptions, we also require at least ten (10) days‚Äô notice of cancellation by email. If you provide such notification less than ten (10) days before the first day of your next subscription year, your credit card may still be charged. If you cancel before the end of your year, you will not be entitled to a refund but we will provide you with a credit towards other ClickFunnels‚Äô subscription services. ClickFunnels in its sole discretion may charge a cancellation fee equal to the amount the subscription was discounted.  

SECTION 8 ‚Äì SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT
----------------------------------------------------

A ClickFunnels user is responsible for paying all sums due to ClickFunnels in connection with their monthly subscription in accordance with these Terms. The first fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the user account is set up and payment of the monthly fee is a condition of access, or after your free trial ends and you have not canceled the automatic subscription with us. Every calendar month, your account will be charged up to the subscription fee plus applicable tax for the following month‚Äôs subscription, together with any other fees for the following month‚Äôs subscription plus any accumulated charges for the past period (collectively, ‚ÄúFees‚Äù). Failure by the ClickFunnels user to use any of the services available through the service provided by ClickFunnels does not relieve the ClickFunnels user of their payment obligations under these Terms.  

Potential users can pay by credit card or debit card. Payment details shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism. You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of the card used to purchase the products or services together with details on when payment is due. You further acknowledge and agree that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with the payment terms for the specific service purchased (unless the subscription is cancelled in accordance with these Terms) and therefore authorize the automatic payment collection terms applicable to that specific service (e.g., on a monthly basis and for a specific amount). If for whatever reason, we are unable to process your monthly subscription payment, we may in our sole discretion, charge you a lesser amount to ‚Äúpause‚Äù your account and retain your information as we attempt to contact you for updated payment information.  

IF YOU ARE A CLICKFUNNELS USER WITH A MONTHLY OR ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBER OR AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHOD, EACH PAYMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AT THE TIME OF YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT DATE (MONTHLY OR ANNUALLY) AND WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF YOUR ENROLLMENT. AS NOTED ABOVE, IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS, WE MAY CHARGE YOU A LESSER AMOUNT TO PAUSE YOUR ACCOUNT. IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO CLICKFUNNELS, YOU MAY DO SO THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT DASHBOARD OR BY EMAILING [CF2SUPPORT@CLICKFUNNELS.COM](mailto:CF2SUPPORT@CLICKFUNNELS.COM) AT LEAST TEN (10) DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR NEXT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH.  

ClickFunnels reserves the right to immediately terminate a user‚Äôs account and/or service for any unpaid (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without notice). Termination of service in no way relieves or excuses the user from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses. In the event ClickFunnels starts collection processes of any type, you will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and expenses, as provided in [Section 20](#Section-20) below.  

In addition to any Fees, ClickFunnels may also charge applicable value added or other tax.

If your order will be delayed, we will contact you at the email address you provided when placing your order.

We shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense related to any delay in shipment or delivery caused by any third party carrier or other delivery service not owned or controlled by us.

Every online business is different, employing different strategic approaches and organizational structures, and offering different products and services. Therefore, individual results will vary from user to user.

Those businesses who purchase our products or services will receive access to software and tools to create Internet sales funnels and otherwise assist with their respective online offerings. However, we do not guarantee your business‚Äô success and based upon many market factors that we cannot control, the software and tools we provide may or may not be applicable to your specific business. Further, we do not make earnings claims, efforts claims, return on investment claims, or claims that our software, tools, or other offerings will make your business any specific amount of money, and it is possible that you will not earn your investment back. We do not sell a business opportunity, ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù program, guaranteed system, franchise system, or a business in a box. You should not purchase our products or services if that is your expectation. Instead, you should purchase with the understanding that using the information and software purchased will take time and effort and may be applicable in some situations but not others. Also, we do not offer any tax, accounting, financial, or legal advice. You should consult your business‚Äô accountant, attorney, or financial advisor for advice on these topics.**

ClickFunnels, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may provide an opportunity for you and customers of your online business to voluntarily ‚Äúround up‚Äù purchases at checkout by various dollar amounts, such as one, three, five, or ten dollars, to be donated to Village Impact and/or Operation Underground Railroad, charitable organizations under Canadian and United States law, respectively, that are tax-exempt under Section 149 of the Canadian Income Tax Act and Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (each, individually, ‚ÄúCharity‚Äù). You agree that such ‚Äúround up‚Äù donation amounts shall not be charged as a separate charge to your customer, but shall be included in a single charge for the total purchase price charged to your customer. ClickFunnels agrees to keep any ‚Äúround up‚Äù donations in a separate, non-interest bearing account pending contribution of such amounts to the Charity. Any amounts constituting ‚Äúround up‚Äù donations shall be irreversibly transferred to ClickFunnels, as agent and nominee for the Charity.

You understand and agree that such donations may be subject to sales tax, and that it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to collect and report such tax for sales to your customers. You further understand and agree that ‚Äúround up‚Äù donations may not be tax deductible by you or your customers. You understand and agree that ClickFunnels is acting as nominee and agent of the Charity with regards to any ‚Äúround up‚Äù donations and, pursuant thereto, ClickFunnels shall transfer such amounts to the Charity as soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after receipt of each donation.

---------------------------------------

EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CLICKFUNNELS OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, AND/OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE PRIVACY STATEMENT AND DPA, THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, YOUR OR A THIRD PARTY‚ÄôS USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SOFTWARE, SERVICE, OR PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CLICKFUNNELS HAS HAD NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS, OR CLAIMS.

SECTION 19 ‚Äì DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR AND YOUR BUSINESS‚Äô RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  

THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.  

If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at [compliance@clickfunnels.com](mailto:compliance@clickfunnels.com) to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Statement, the DPA, the Affiliate Agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within one hundred and twenty (120) days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (‚ÄúAAA‚Äù), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in [Sections 20](#Section-20) and [21](#Section-21) below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Ada County, Idaho, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA‚Äôs Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA‚Äôs Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Statement, the DPA, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or ClickFunnels.  

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA‚Äôs Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.  

The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Idaho without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1-16, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  

You and ClickFunnels agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You and ClickFunnels expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.  

Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the one hundred and twenty (120) day informal resolution procedures described above).  

This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1-16, as amended.  

This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with ClickFunnels, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.  

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.  

SECTION 20 ‚Äì CLICKFUNNELS‚Äô ADDITIONAL REMEDIES
----------------------------------------------

In order to prevent or limit irreparable injury to ClickFunnels, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement or any infringement or threatened infringement by you of the intellectual property of ClickFunnels or a third-party, ClickFunnels shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Ada County, Idaho restraining such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting ClickFunnels from pursuing in court any other remedies available to it for such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement, including the recovery of monetary damages from you and your business. You and your business hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the courts of Ada County, Idaho for all such claims, and forever waive any challenge to said courts‚Äô exclusive jurisdiction or venue.
