**Our Company Privacy Policy**
==============================

_This Privacy Policy was last updated on Febuary 1st 2024._

We have made this policy short and easy to read and to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) [2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) (GDPR).

Unless we link to a different policy or state otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies when you visit or use the Robotel website, applications, APIs, or other related services. By using our services, you consent to such use of your information and Personal Data and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

The data protection principle applies to all data entered by visitors to any Robotel website, by an institution about their students, and teachers. It also applies to data recordings generated by the Robotel programs and stored in the database.

This privacy policy will explain how Robotel uses the personal data we collect from you when you use our website.

[**What data do we collect?**](#what_data_do_we_collect)
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are only browsing our website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet tools such as cookies, web server logs, and analytics services to gather the data. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection. We collect from everyone, whether they have a Robotel account or not. Our Company collects the following data:

* Personal identification information (full name, email address, geolocation, school establishment)
* Login identification information (email address, passwords)
* Optional personal identification information (job title, phone number, message)

If you (or your institution's administrators) have created an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. This includes either your username, or your name, or your email address, and your password.

We collect this information to create your account and provide services to you. We use your information to identify you in our programs so that we can provide you with information about scores and activities in exercises in the SmartClass programs. We may use your email address to communicate further with you. 

[How do we collect your data?](#how_do_we_collect_your_data)
------------------------------------------------------------

You directly provide Robotel with most of the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you:

* Register online or place an order for any of our products or services.
* Voluntarily complete a customer survey or provide feedback on any of our message boards or via email.
* Use or view our website via your browser’s cookies.

[**How will we use your data?**](#how_will_we_use_your_data)
------------------------------------------------------------

All data is available to a limited number of Robotel staff for support, research, and development work. We do not allow any outside parties to access the database. Any personal information provided by you is used only to help us provide a better service to you and for us to identify your needs and requirements.

Robotel collects your data so that we can:

* Process your order, manage your account.
* Email you with special offers on other products and services we think you might like.
* Give you access to our different services

[**How do we store your data?**](#how_do_we_store_your_data)
------------------------------------------------------------

Robotel securely stores your data at a web provider. We are using HostGator and Google servers. For sensitive data like passwords, we use encryption functions.

We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it's important to protect passwords and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.

A teacher's access is restricted to data on students in their group only. An account administrator can see all the details for that account.

When a user is deleted from the system, all records relating to that user are deleted.

[How long we keep your data?](#how_long_we_keep_your_data)
----------------------------------------------------------

We keep personal information only for as long as required for the purposes for which it's supplied. Where your information is no longer required, we will always make sure it is disposed of or anonymized safely and securely.

For institutional accounts, data is kept for access by the administrator and other licensed parties within the institution for as long as the license is valid and the user account is active. Where the user account becomes inactive, data will be deleted or anonymized for a maximum of one year after the last login. An administrator can delete data at any time, which will cause it to be permanently and safely destroyed.

Where an institutional license lapses or terminates, data is kept for up to a year. This is so that it can be restored to the system should the institution choose to renew its subscription. After a maximum of a year, the data will be deleted or anonymized.

[**Google OAuth**](#google_oauth)
---------------------------------

The use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google’s APIs to our SmartClass by Robotel platform will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes) including the Limited Use requirements.

SmartClass by Robotel will use the [https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events) scope to create, update and delete a user's Google calendar events that pertain directly to the ‘Go Live’ part of the SmartClass application. The users will be able to manage their ‘Go Live’ events through the SmartClass by Robotel application which will then sync with their Google calendar. The events created are linked to a class and the meeting link will then be used by the members of the class for online sessions with the person who created the event. We do not share this information obtained throughout the OAuth process with any third-party tools.

If you no longer wish for us to be connected to your Google Calendar account, you can visit your Google account connection page at the following link [https://myaccount.google.com/connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections) or contact us:  
Call us at: +1 (450) 680-1448

[**Marketing**](#marketing)
---------------------------

Our Company would like to send you information about our products and services that we think you might like, as well as those of our partner companies. If you have agreed to receive marketing, you may always opt-out at a later date.
