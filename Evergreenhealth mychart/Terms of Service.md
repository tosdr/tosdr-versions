TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE
---------------------------

Effective Date: 10/1/2022

**Overview**

MyChart provides a view into your Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and gives you a secure way to communicate with your healthcare team. To obtain copies of information, contact the Health Information Department at 425-899-5799.

Your use of MyChart is governed by these Terms of Use (**Terms**) and MyChart's Privacy Policy (**Policy**). By using or accessing data through MyChart you agree to be bound by these Terms and the Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms or the Policy, you may not establish a MyChart connection. However, you are still entitled to access your health information through the Health Information Department at 425-899-5799.

**Using MyChart**

Usernames and passwords are unique and personal to each individual. You should not permit any other person to access MyChart with your username and password. You are responsible for the use of your account through your username and password. If you learn or suspect that your username or password has been wrongfully used or disclosed, you should promptly notify us and immediately reset your password. To help ensure the security of your password or account, you should sign out of your account at the end of each session.

To preserve the confidentiality of your health information, we recommend that you use an email address that is unique to you and which you do not share with anyone else. If you share your email address, or have provided access to your email account, with another person you understand and agree that person may have access to your health information. If you change your email address, please contact EvergreenHealth to provide your new email address so that you will continue to receive updates and other pertinent information.

**No Unlawful or Prohibited Use**

You may not use MyChart for any purpose that is unlawful, immoral or is otherwise prohibited by these Terms. You may not use MyChart in any manner which could damage, disable, overburden, or impair MyChart or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of MyChart. You may not obtain or attempt to obtain any materials or information through MyChart by any means not intentionally made available or provided to you through MyChart.

**Accessing another Person's Connection**

If you are authorized to view another individual's health information, you may be given access to their MyChart account. Your use of their MyChart account is subject to these Terms.

If you choose to share your health information through MyChart with another individual, you acknowledge and accept responsibility for your decision to provide such potentially sensitive information.

**Disclosure of Information**

We will only disclose your information as provided in the EvergreenHealth Notice of Privacy Practices.

**External Links**

MyChart may contain links to third party websites. We exercise no authority over such linked sites, each of which maintains independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. Such links are provided only for your convenience, and you access them at your own risk. We assume no responsibility or liability for such sites and are not responsible for their policies or procedures. Similarly, we cannot take responsibility for your privacy or the content of such websites.

We do not endorse any programs, activities, or services offered by third parties. We make no warranty of any kind as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness of any such programs, activities and services.

**No Warranty**

You are responsible for any acts or omissions relating to your use of MyChart and for any damages incurred as a result thereof. MYCHART IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WE DO NOT, AND OUR SUPPLIERS DO NOT, (I) WARRANT THE RELIABILITY OR AVAILABILITY OF MYCHART, OR (II) GUARANTEE THAT MYCHART WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS EACH DISCLAIM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ON BEHALF OF US AND OUR SUPPLIERS, ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND LOST PROFITS, REVENUES OR DATA.

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH MYCHART, OR WITH THESE TERMS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING MYCHART.

**Termination**

MyChart services may terminate at any time. Your account access may be terminated, suspended or deleted, at any time and for any reason, without providing notice.

**Notices**

We may deliver notice to you by means of electronic mail, a general notice on our website, a popup or click through notice in MyChart, or by written communication delivered by first class U.S. mail to your address in our records.

**General**

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to these Terms or your use of the MyChart must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. All actions arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the MyChart must be brought in the federal or state courts of King County, Washington. Our failure to enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. We may assign our rights and duties to any party at any time without notice to you and may provide services to you though our business partners and suppliers.

Our performance of these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our obligation to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of MyChart, or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect. Unless specified otherwise, as you use MyChart, these Terms constitute our entire agreement with respect to MyChart and these Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between us with respect to MyChart.

**Amendments to these Terms of Use**

We may change these Terms at any time without advance notice to you. Although, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of material changes we make to these Terms, you are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms. We display an effective date on these Terms so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change. Your continued use of MyChart constitutes your acceptance of any revised Terms.
