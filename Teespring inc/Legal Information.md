Your Right to Implement a Listing: By creating a listing through the Spring Service, you represent and warrant that you own or are the licensee of all trademark rights, copyrights, rights of publicity and other intellectual property or other proprietary rights necessary to create and implement the listing (“Listing Rights”), including any rights relating to the name, description, images, text or URL used for the listing.

You agree that you are the organizer of your online events, and you are solely responsible for providing the event (including the third-party platform for hosting or streaming the event) and ensuring that the online event is delivered as described. You are also responsible for all activities related to your online events that take place off the Spring Service, such as on any third-party streaming platform.
