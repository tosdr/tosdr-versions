These cookies are set by us or our third-party analytics providers and allow us to record certain information about you, such as the pages you visit on our web site; how many times you visit our website; and links you might click on.

We use this type of cookie to understand and analyse how visitors use our online services and look for ways to improve them. For example, a cookie might tell us that lots of people give up on an application process at a particular step – so we can try to make that step easier to complete.

The third-party analytics providers may also collect other information about you such as your IP address, your geographical location, what type of device you are using and information about the device. This information can be used to create a unique fingerprint to help further identify you on other webpages you might visit and can be used to create a profile of your online activities and interests.

You can see more information about which third-party analytics providers we use and switch these cookies off by visiting your Cookies Preference Centre.

**Functionality Cookies**

These cookies remember your preferences and tailor the website to provide enhanced features. Without these cookies, we cannot remember your choices or personalise your online experience.

We use this type of cookie to:

* Make online banking login faster by remembering you between visits on your personal devices
* Simplify online transactions by remembering the last account you used and showing it as the default for your next transaction
* Display your mini-statements as you like them by remembering which panels you’ve expanded and collapsed
* Remembering relevant information as you browse from page to page to save you re-entering the same information repeatedly
* Provide enhanced features, such as playing videos or allowing you to post a comment.

**Targeting Cookies**

These cookies are set by us (or our third-party marketing partners, which may include social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn amongst others, and video streaming platforms such as Youtube) and are used to deliver onsite or offsite adverts relevant to you and your interests and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These cookies are called retargeting cookies and can track your browsing history and online activities across websites to create a profile of your online activities and interests.

This information is shared with our third-party marketing partners and will enable us to serve you with advertising when you visit other sites (for example, to remind you of products or services you may have shown an interest in or to provide you with special offers). This could include information about your browsing activity, your device’s IP address, cookie string data (which is used to identify the device type, operating system and browser), data about the online ads we have served to you and your interaction with those ads. We also work with third parties who may place cookies on your web browser to enable us and other advertisers to serve you with advertising based on your browsing and online search activity.

This may involve transferring information to countries outside of the UK and European Economic Area (which includes countries in the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Where required, we will put in place appropriate data transfer mechanisms to ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws.
