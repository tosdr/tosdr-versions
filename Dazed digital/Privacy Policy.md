### **4\. Legal basis for processing your personal information**

We will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use your personal information. In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following:

(a) Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to receive certain marketing from us. You can withdraw your consent at any time, including by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing email we send you.  
(b) Our legitimate business interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our users, promote our services and operate effectively as a style and culture magazine and digital platform provided in each case that this is done in a legitimate way which does not unduly affect your privacy and other rights. For example, we will rely on this legal basis when we conduct certain market analysis to understand our users in sufficient detail, so we can create new services and improve the profile of our brand.  
(c) Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): For example, where you have purchased a product from us and we need to use your contact details and payment information in order to process your order and send the product to you.  
(d) Compliance with law: Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.

### **5\. Where we store your personal information**

5.1 The personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UK or the European Economic Area (the EEA), including countries, which have less strict, or no data protection laws, when compared to those in the UK and Europe.  
5.2 Whenever we transfer your information as described in the paragraph above, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice. In these cases, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (such as the EU “Standard Contractual Clauses” and the EU-US “Privacy Shield”) to ensure your information is subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country. If you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your personal information and privacy rights in these circumstances.

### **6\. How we keep your personal information**

6.1 We take steps to ensure that the personal information that you provide is retained for only as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. After this period it will be deleted or in some cases anonymised. For example, where you have made a purchase with us, we will keep a record of your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, tax and warranty purposes. We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim.  
6.2 Where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal information. However, please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.

### **7\. Children**

8.3 We will share your personal information with any selected third party that you consent to our sharing your information with for marketing purposes, for example any brand partners we collaborate with in connection with campaigns or competitions. We will always ask for your consent to do so before sharing with any such parties.  
8.4 We may disclose your personal information to other third parties in the following cases:  
8.4.1 for the purposes of research, evaluation, and analysis;  
8.4.2 in the event that we sell any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective buyer of such business or assets

8.4.5 to protect the rights, property or safety of us or our users, or others, and in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions (this includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).

9.1 You have certain rights in relation to your personal information. These include: the right to be informed of the ways in which we use your information (as we seek to do in this Privacy Notice), the right to object to the processing of your information for certain purposes (such as marketing purposes), the right to access your personal information, the right to request that we correct or rectify any information that we hold about you which is out of date or incorrect, to restrict or erase your information (in certain circumstances), or to receive a machine-readable copy of your personal information.  
9.2 We will handle any request to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable law and any relevant legal exemptions. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details below.  
9.3 You may also have the right to complain to a data protection authority such as the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/) (or relevant authority in your country of residence) if you think we have processed your personal information in a manner which is unlawful or breaches your rights. If you have such concerns we request that you initially contact us (using the contact details below) so that we can investigate, and hopefully resolve, your concerns.  
9.4 Our website and other digital properties may, from time to time, contain links to and from third party websites and services such as our business partners and advertisers. If you follow a link to any of these websites and/or services, please note that they have their own privacy notices and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for them. Please check any such third party privacy notices before you submit any personal information to these websites or services.
