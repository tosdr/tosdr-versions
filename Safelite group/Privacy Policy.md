F. How to Exercise Your Rights 

* How to submit requests. To exercise your rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either contacting us at [onlinehelp@safelite.com](mailto:onlinehelp@safelite.com) or clicking [here](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/d3b95a93-e22e-4d4d-a806-482052406557/7656b12f-2b42-442e-88f3-c62b713709f9.html) to submit the request online or copy and pasting this into your browser: [https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/d3b95a93-e22e-4d4d-a806-482052406557/draft/48f5d98d-2135-41f2-a54a-701815a0247a](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/d3b95a93-e22e-4d4d-a806-482052406557/draft/48f5d98d-2135-41f2-a54a-701815a0247a)
* Who may submit requests. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may designate an authorized agent in writing to make a request on your behalf.  
* How often can you submit requests. You may only make an Access request twice within a 12-month period.  
* How we verify and respond to requests.  
    * Your request must be verifiable. That means that you, or your authorized agent, must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized agent of that person with written permission from the consumer or a power of attorney to act on their behalf. 
    * We may verify your request: 
        * Through our existing authentication practices for your password-protected account with us, if you have one. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, if you do not make a request through an account with us. 
        * If you do not have a password-protected account with us, we may require you to provide certain information such as first name, last name, phone number, service address, and/or invoice number to verify your identify.  
        * Regardless of whether or not you have a password-protected account with us, if we believe it is reasonable in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or deletion, we may require you to verify additional pieces of information and/or sign a declaration under penalty of perjury verifying your identity and request.
    * Your verifiable consumer request must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. 
    * We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. 
    * We will only use Personal Information provided in a request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request and fulfill or deny the request. We may retain Personal Information provided in connection with your request for at least two (2) years as required by law. 
    * Response Timing and Format. 
        * We will acknowledge receipt of your request within ten (10) business days from its receipt. 
        * We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days from its receipt. If we require more time, up to a maximum of ninety (90) days from receipt as provided by law, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you are a Connecticut or Virginia resident, then the maximum time to respond is sixty (60) days from its receipt. 
        * If you have a password-protected online account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have a password-protected online account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  
        * The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. If you requested a copy of the specific Personal Information we have on file about you, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 

6. G. Opt Out of Sale/Sharing of Personal Information 
    

If you would like to opt out of the sale or sharing for targeted advertising purposes of your Personal Information, you may do so using our Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information online form by clicking [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/d3b95a93-e22e-4d4d-a806-482052406557/draft/48f5d98d-2135-41f2-a54a-701815a0247a) or copy and pasting this into your browser: [https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/d3b95a93-e22e-4d4d-a806-482052406557/draft/48f5d98d-2135-41f2-a54a-701815a0247a](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/d3b95a93-e22e-4d4d-a806-482052406557/draft/48f5d98d-2135-41f2-a54a-701815a0247a). We will also recognize browser-based opt-out signals as required under law. If we receive an opt-out signal and are able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out related to all Personal Information we have on file for the consumer. If we receive an opt-out signal and are not able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out limited to the Personal Information we collect from the consumer during the online session during which the signal is present. 

8. H. Non-Discrimination 
    

We will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their privacy rights as allowed by law.
