If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

#### 24\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

All matters relating to the Services and these Terms of Service and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Ohio or any other jurisdiction).

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Service or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the state or federal courts of Ohio although we retain the right to bring any suit, action or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Service in your state or country of residence. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

#### 25\. Disputes: Arbitration Agreement, and Class Waiver.

**Please read this section carefully. Except as the Terms otherwise provide, you waive your rights to try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in any class, collective, or other representative action.**

##### 25.1 Agreement to Binding Arbitration.

Before initiating arbitration, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely. You may seek to resolve any customer concerns through our Customer Care Team at 888-238-4527 or send the written description by U.S. Mail to Customer Care: 7400 Safelite Way, Columbus, Ohio 43235, or send electronic mail to customer.care@safelite.com. You agree to negotiate with us in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 30 days after our receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.

By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against the Site or our Services on an individual basis in arbitration. You and we agree that any disputes between us (including any disputes between you and a third-party agent of Safelite) will be resolved through binding and final arbitration and not in a court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. This includes, but is not limited to, (a) any dispute, claims, or controversy arising out of or relating to any part of the Terms, (b) the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof; or (c) your access to or use of the Site's services or products at any time. Such dispute shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for individual arbitration in the county of your billing address (or such other location as you and we mutually agree) and shall be before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Procedures, only as modified by this agreement.

The parties agree that the arbitrator (“Arbitrator”), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.

By agreeing to individual arbitration, you understand and agree that you are waiving your right to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle any disputes or claims. The rules in arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury. Although review is limited, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as would be available in court, and must enforce the same limitations stated in these Terms as a court would.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyright rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

##### 25.2 No Class Action.

You and we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that you and we each agree to arbitrate in our individual capacities only, not as a representative of a class, a member of a class, or a Private Attorney General. Likewise, an arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

##### 25.3 Rules and Governing Law.

The arbitration will be administered by the AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at [https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer\_Rules\_Web\_1.pdf](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_1.pdf). The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.

##### 25.4 Federal Arbitration Act.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of Ohio, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

##### 25.5 Arbitration Process.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, after satisfying the condition precedent identified above, you must (1) send a verified and personally signed demand for arbitration that describes (a) the nature and basis of your claims, and (b) the nature and basis of the relief sought, including a detailed calculation to: Safelite Legal Department, 7400 Safelite Way, Columbus, Ohio 43235, and (2) contact the AAA and follow the appropriate procedures with the AAA to commence the arbitration. The AAA consumer rules for arbitration will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's applicable Consumer Rules. The parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law or the arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith. In addition, the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. The arbitration may be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location as set forth in the AAA rules. If requested, you shall personally appear (with your counsel if you have one) at an initial telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Safelite will pay all fees and costs that we are required by law to pay.

Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, in the event that any provision of this section is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Columbus, Ohio. You and we will submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Columbus, Ohio for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

##### 25.6 Arbitrator's Decision.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction. An arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties.

Judgment on any award rendered by the arbitrator is final, binding and conclusive on you and us and your and our respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns.

With the exception of disclosures to affiliates and legal counsel, all negotiations and arbitration proceedings related to a dispute (including a settlement, award, or the documents and briefs exchanged or produced during arbitration) are confidential and may not be disclosed by the parties except to the extent necessary for interim measures or conservatory relief, the enforcement of an arbitration award, or as required by law.

##### 25.7 Opt-Out Procedure Applicable To All Consumers.

You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at Legal@Safelite.com providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept these Terms.

#### 26\. Limitation on Time to File Claims

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR THE SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. So, for example, if a provision in these terms is found to be unenforceable, we agree an arbitrator (or, if permitted, a court) shall only strike that provision and that the remaining terms of these Terms of Service shall remain in force.

#### 27\. No Assignment; Waiver and Severability

You may not assign these Terms of Service without Safelite's prior written consent and any purported assignment in violation of these Terms of Service shall be void.

No waiver of or by Safelite of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Safelite to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

#### 28\. Entire Agreement

The Terms of Service (including our Privacy Policy and any other Additional Terms incorporated by reference) constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Safelite with respect to the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Services.
