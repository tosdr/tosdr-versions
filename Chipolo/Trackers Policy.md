Cookie Policy
=============

Updated on March 11, 2024

Chipolo and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use various technologies to collect information, such as cookies and web beacons as you browse our online services and apps (“the Services”) listed below:

* chipolo.net,
* app.chipolo.net.

Cookies are small text files. They are commonly downloaded to your computer or mobile device by websites that you visit. They enable the website to tag your device and recognize it as you move around the site (and potentially when you return at a later date) so that, for example, you do not have to re-enter your password each time you move between pages of the website.

Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels, pixel tags, or web bugs) are small image files commonly used for simple analytics and tracking of user actions like opening an email message.

How do we use them?
-------------------

### Where strictly necessary

The use of these cookies is essential for our Services to work. We use them for several purposes, depending on the product, including:

**• Sign-in and authentication  
**When you use any of our Services requiring you to sign in, we store a record of your session information in a cookie on your device. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.

**• Storing your settings  
**Some of the settings you control on our Services require us to set a cookie to provide you with the relevant information or adapt the experience to you. These include storing cookie consent information for deciding what cookies and technologies we use when you visit our Services.

**• Keeping track of information across sub-pages  
**When you provide information during your visit to our Services, we store the data in a cookie to remember what you’ve selected or entered across different subpages. Examples of this include saving your shopping cart content and information during the checkout process on our online shops.

### For functionality

We use third-party services to enhance the basic functionality of our website.

**• Zendesk  
**We use Zendesk Chat to provide users with a live chat widget for contacting our support agents.

### For analytics

We use third-party services for measuring how users interact with our Services.

**• Brevo  
**We use Brevo cookies for measuring the performance of our e-mail marketing campaigns.

**• Microsoft Clarity  
**We use Microsoft Clarity for understanding how our users behave on our site and to help optimize the content and positioning of our content for an enjoyable and efficient user experience.

### For advertising

We use third-party services and cookies for providing Chipolo ads on different advertising networks and for tracking their performance.

**• Meta Pixel**  
We use Meta Pixel to create remarketing audiences and measure the performance of advertising campaigns served on services provided by Meta (e.g. Facebook and Instagram). To opt-out of personalized ads account-wide, visit your [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053).

**• TikTok Pixel  
**We use TikTok Pixel to measure the performance of advertising campaigns served on TikTok.

**• SafeOpt (AddShoppers)  
**We use SafeOpt for affiliate marketing to deliver offers to our shoppers who are using their services.

**• Rakuten Advertising  
**We partner with Rakuten Advertising, who may collect personal information when you interact with our site. The collection and use of this information are subject to the privacy policy located [here](https://rakutenadvertising.com/legal-notices/services-privacy-policy/).

### Google Analytics and Google Ads

In addition to the services listed in previous paragraphs, we use Google Analytics and Google Ads to measure the performance of our website, analyze our visitor’s behavior, track the performance of our Google Ads campaigns and enable personalized advertising across Google’s advertising network.

You can opt-out of Google Analytics data collection browser-wide by using a browser extension as described [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

Depending on your cookie settings, the type and scope of data collected by Google Analytics and Google Ads will change. Here is a summary of how cookie settings will affect the data collected by these services:

**• For analytics  
**Enables storage of cookies related to analytics. This enables analytics to identify you across multiple pages on our website and enables metrics like visit duration.

**• For advertising  
**Enables storage of cookies related to advertising. This allows the advertising related scripts to identify you across multiple pages on the website.

**• For user data  
**Enables sending user data to Google for online advertising purposes. This includes hashed first party data like your email address.

**• For personalization  
**Enables storage of cookies and data related to personalized advertising. This enables Google Ads to provide features like remarketing.

Turn your Chipolos into a colorful gift.

The gift pouch fits perfectly to one Chipolo box and can turn your multipack or Bundle into a bunch of gits in no time. Put the box with the Chipolo in, slide the tab into the designated slot and finish it with a short personal message on the pouch. Each pouch is made from paper and can hold one Chipolo box.
