============

Last update on: March 22, 2023

By accessing or using the applications and services owned or operated by Chipolo, d.o.o., whether through our software app(s) or website (our “Services”), you are accepting and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth below (these “Terms”).

We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If you continue to use the Services after we’ve notified you that the Terms have been modified, you are agreeing to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms then you may no longer use the Services. Because our Services continue to evolve, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, in our sole discretion.

License
-------

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Chipolo grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download and install a copy of our software app (the “App”) on a single mobile device that you own or control and to run such copy of the App and use our Services solely for your own personal non-commercial purposes. We reserve all rights in and to the App and Services not expressly granted to you under these Terms. You may not: (i) copy, modify or create derivative works based on the App or Services; (ii) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lend or rent the App to any third party; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App; or (iv) make the functionality of the App or Services available to multiple users through any means.

Downloading Our App
-------------------

When you download our App from the Apple App Store, Google Play or other app store or app distribution platform (an “App Store”), you acknowledge and agree that:

* These Terms are concluded between us, and not with the App Store, and that we (not the App Store), are solely responsible for our App.
* The App Store has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to our App or handle any warranty claims.
* The App Store is not responsible for addressing any claims you have relating to our App, including product liability claims, consumer protection claims, intellectual property infringement claims, or any claim that our App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement.
* The App Store is a third party beneficiary of these Terms and has the right to enforce these Terms against you (as it relates to your license of our App through their App Store). You must also comply with the App Store’s terms of service when using our App.

Creating an Account

In order to use our Services, you must have an account with us. By creating an account, you represent that (a) all required information you provide is truthful and accurate; (b) you are of legal age to agree to these Terms; and (c) your use of our Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation or these Terms.

You are responsible for the content, such as any text, images, and other material and information, that you upload or post on or through our Services (your “Content”), and its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

Chipolo Hardware Limited Warranty

Chipolo warrants that your Chipolo hardware product (“the Product”) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of two (2) years from the date of delivery to the original retail purchaser (“the Warranty Period”). If a defect in the Product arises within the Warranty Period, Chipolo will, at its sole option and subject to applicable laws: (a) repair or replace it with a new or refurbished product or component; or (b) refund the original purchase price upon return of the defective Product. This Warranty does not apply where the instructions for use and activation of the Product are not complied with or where the Product is damaged as a result of abuse, accident, modification or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS ARE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE EXPRESS WARRANTY. ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED.

Disclaimer of Warranty for App and Services

We are not responsible for the content provided by, or the conduct of, any user and you bear the entire risk of using the App and Services and any interactions with other users. Our App and Services are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and we do not represent, warrant, or guarantee that the App and Services will be provided uninterrupted, error-free, virus-free, or that defects will be corrected. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING THE APP AND SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. If applicable law requires any warranties with respect to our App or Services, all such warranties are limited in duration to thirty (30) days from the date of your first use or the minimum duration allowed by law.  

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, APP OR SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, APP OR SERVICE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCT IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE.

Refund Policy
-------------

Should you be dissatisfied with our product, the original retail purchaser of the Product may return all Chipolos purchased in the original transaction, in their original condition, with the original receipt and packaging, within 30 days of the date of delivery to the original retail purchaser and Chipolo d.o.o. will exchange it or provide a full refund of the original purchase price. Please note that this policy applies only to Products you purchase directly from Chipolo d.o.o.. This is in addition to your legal rights and your rights under the Chipolo hardware two (2) year Worldwide Warranty referred to above.

Requesting a Refund
-------------------

A Chipolo order is eligible for a refund if you’ve had it less than 30 days, and the order is returned in good condition with the original packaging. You will need to [contact us](https://support.chipolo.net/hc/en-us) prior to returning the order to receive the proper return instructions. Please note that partial returns are not eligible for a refund. (Example: If you ordered 4 Chipolos, you must return all 4 Chipolos to receive a refund.)

Note: Chipolo d.o.o. can only refund orders placed directly through our website, www.chipolo.net. If you purchased Chipolo through another party (such as Amazon.com) please contact them for refund instructions.

Return and Refund instructions
------------------------------

Once you have submitted your request you will be contacted within 24 hours with instructions on how to return your order. Upon receipt, we will verify that all of the Chipolos in your original order are included with the return and that the Chipolos are in good physical condition. Once the refund has been processed a confirmation message will be sent out with information on when the refund should be expected.

Exclusions
----------

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.

General Provisions
------------------

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us with respect to the subject matter and supersede any prior understandings and agreements. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Slovenia, without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
