Privacy Policy
==============

Last update on: October 10, 2023

Thank you for using Chipolo!

Chipolo (“we”) wrote this policy to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we use it, your rights in connection with our collection and processing of the information and what choices you have. For your convenience we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.

We are proud to comply with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR). GDPR is a comprehensive European data protection law that sets the new global standard regarding your personal information.

We offer services to our users, through our:

* Website chipolo.net (the “Website”);
* Website app.chipolo.net (the “Web app”);
* Website support.chipolo.net (the “Support Center”);
* Chipolo mobile application (the “Chipolo app”);
* Social media pages;
* Other associated services that we provide both online and offline.

Services listed above are collectively referred to as the “Services”.

About us
--------

Chipolo d.o.o., Gabrsko 12, 1420 Trbovlje, Slovenia and its fully owned subsidiary Chipolo Inc, Schissel Smallberg 450 7th Ave #2710, NY 10123, USA are the responsible parties and data controllers with respect to personal information collected through the Services. If you want to exercise any of your rights in relation to our processing of your Personal Information, Chipolo d.o.o. shall be the responsible party.

Our primary goals in using your data and information are to create your account, provide Services to you, improve our Services, contact you, conduct marketing and research and create anonymous statistical reports for internal use.

Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to information and data collected or received through your use of the Service. We are not responsible for the actions of third party individuals or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information or data you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Any links to those sites do not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those individuals or companies.

If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.

For general information and privacy questions please feel free to contact us via [\[email protected\]](https://chipolo.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  

How we collect and use your information
---------------------------------------

In this Privacy Policy, the term "Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to a name, an identification number, or, in certain circumstances, location information, an IP address or the unique identifier allocated to each Chipolo device. Specifically, we collect, process and use the following information from you, which may include Personal Information:

### Placing an Order

#### Contact Information

When you place an order on our website, you’ll need to provide an email address, a first and last name, and a shipping and billing address and any other information you voluntarily give to us.

Additionally, for shipping to most parts of the world, we will require you to provide a contact phone number used for delivery purposes. This is a requirement from many delivery companies that we work with.

The contact information will be used to complete and fulfill the order and your personal information will be retained according to the Slovenian legislation (10 years for issued invoices).

#### Information Provided by You About Others

When providing personal information of another person, we rely upon you to obtain the consent necessary for us to process their personal information.

For sending Chipolos as a gift, the processing of the gift recipient's personal information you provide on the webpage (in the cart and during the checkout process) will be consistent with the description for processing Contact Information from the previous chapter and any other references to the Contact Information throughout our Privacy policy.

#### Information About You Provided by Others

If you received Chipolo as a gift directly from our webpage, someone else has provided your personal information to us to make it possible to send the package directly to you. The processing of your personal information will be (and was) strictly limited to the minimum required processing that we needed to do to ship the package to you and will be retained based on the requirements of our Slovenian legislation. Your personal information was shared with our shipping providers and external fulfillment partners (for US, Canadian and UK addresses) acting as data processors for us and in no way for their own use. No additional processing will be done on your personal information.  

#### Payment Information

In order to complete your order on our website, you’ll need to provide payment information, such as your credit card, PayPal account, Apple Pay or Google Pay. This information is needed in order to process your order and is not stored on our servers, but servers of the listed 3rd party payment providers.

List of the available 3rd party payment providers that are available for use on our webpage with links to pages explaining their privacy policies:

* [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/legal/privacy-policy)
* [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/privacy/privacyhub)
* [Apple Pay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203027)
* [Google Pay](https://support.google.com/googlepay/answer/10223752?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)

#### Order Fulfillment

US and Canadian orders are fulfilled by our external warehousing and fulfillment partner [Shipmonk](https://www.shipmonk.com/) and their network of delivery partners.

UK orders are fulfilled by our external warehousing and fulfillment partner [Rapidpack](https://rapidpack.co.uk/) and their network of delivery partners.

All other orders are shipped from Chipolo d.o.o. using one of the below delivery providers depending on the country and the shipping method selected:

* [DHL Express](https://www.dhl.com/)
* [Pošta Slovenije](https://www.posta.si/)
* [GLS](https://gls-group.eu/)
* [DPD](https://www.dpd.com/)

We will share your shipping address with any of the companies listed in this chapter for the purposes of delivering the items you have ordered to your address.

### Registration for the use of our Services

You can register for the use of our Services by manually creating a Chipolo account or by using an existing third party account, such as Apple, Google or Facebook, to create one.

When creating a Chipolo account, you’ll need to provide a display name, a valid email address and a password. You can choose whether or not your display name includes your first and/or last name.

When using an existing third party account, we obtain your profile information and your email address from this account. The information we get from third party providers often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.

We do not identify you personally to other users or make your account information available to any third parties in any way that could identify you without your prior consent.

### Information from your use of our Services

#### Chipolo ID and name

When you activate Chipolo using the Chipolo app, that Chipolo’s unique identifier (or Chipolo ID) will be associated with your account. If you choose to name your Chipolo, this information will also be associated with your account.

#### Location Information

Chipolo is designed to tell you where your items are. In order to do that, it’s necessary to collect data about your location. We use the term “Location Information” to refer to the combined location data of your phone or device, and your Chipolo.

While the app is running on your device, it periodically transmits your Location Information (even while running in the background). This allows us to show you, on your map, the last place your Chipolo was seen by your device. It is one of the primary ways Chipolo helps you find your lost items.

We may also collect and update location information for your Chipolo(s) "anonymously" (i.e., we will not disclose your identity to the other user and not disclose the other user's identity to you) from other Chipolo users who are running the app within Bluetooth range of your device. We do this to provide you with the most recent and accurate location of your Chipolos, even if they are out of your devices’ Bluetooth range. The Location Information associated with your Chipolo(s) is never made available to these users.

If you use a computer, phone, or other device in relation to the Services, we use the IP address of that computer or device to determine an approximate location (only to the country level). We do this so that we can provide you with a better, more-personal experience.

We may also use your Location Information to promote the Services or provide you with personalized offers if you agree to such usage with separate consents. However, your Location Information is never shared with other users unless you choose to share it yourself through the use of the sharing features part of our Services.

#### Usage Information

These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other internet service, there’s certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our Services. We track how, and how often you use our Services. We also collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use them for Services. This includes information such as your device’s model, operating system type and version, and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide you with optimal Services and customer support, and to collect anonymous statistics that helps us understand our user base.

#### Activity Recognition (Physical Activity and Health Data)

Chipolo app uses activity recognition (physical activity recognition) features on your phone to help with triggering the Out of Range Alerts and to help keep the Chipolo app running in the background. In terms of Out of Range Alerts, this data is used to reduce the number of false alerts and to reduce the latency of the alerts.

Chipolo app never stores or sends your health data (collected via the activity recognition mechanisms on your mobile device) to the Chipolo servers or any 3rd party services. In other words - your health data collected via the Chipolo app never leaves your mobile device and we never see or process this data.  

#### Information collected through Chipolo’s Support Services

We provide support services via live chat on our website, email request submissions, recorded inbound and outbound telephone calls and direct email. We collect Personal Information you may have to provide to our customer care team in the process. This includes, but is not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. In the absence of such data, we cannot provide you with Support Services. We may use and process your Personal Information, including Location information, to handle your support request and provide you with the best support possible, including quality assurance control.

As described in greater detail below, we may share this information (including Personal Information) with our affiliates and with third party partners (as defined below) and use it in ways consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Your right to object to the processing of your data for certain purposes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have the following rights in relation to your personal information, which you may exercise in the same way as you may exercise the rights in the preceding section (Your rights in relation to your personal information):

* To object to us using or processing your personal information where we use or process it in order to carry out a task in the public interest, where we do so in the exercise of official authority or for our legitimate interests, including “profiling” (i.e. predicting your behaviour based on your personal information) based on any of these purposes;

Security safeguards
-------------------

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure your personal information and to protect it against unauthorised or unlawful use or processing as well as against the accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal information, including:

* Only sharing and providing access to your personal information to the minimum extent necessary and subject to confidentiality restrictions;

Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining access to this information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Data retention
--------------

We retain your information:

* For as long as you have not deleted your account;
* For any legal obligation to continue to process your information, such as any record-keeping and tax obligations imposed by applicable law or whether we have any legal basis to continue to process your personal information, such as your consent;
* To retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

As indicated above we will store your information for no longer than necessary. When information is no longer needed, we shall delete it using reasonable measures to protect the information from unauthorized access or use.

No one under the age of 14 may provide any Personal Information.

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 14, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://chipolo.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

International transfer
----------------------

We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to Data Processing Partners across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and jurisdictions may not have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction, and we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to enable transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

When we transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area, the country to which it is transferred will either be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission, or if not (or if we transfer your personal information to an international organisation), we will ensure that the transfer takes place on the basis of one or more of the following safeguards:

* Data protection policies adhered to by the data controller and other companies and entities within our corporate group from time to time, which comply with applicable laws, known as “binding corporate rules” or “BCRs”;
* Standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or adopted by the Information Commissioner and approved by the European Commission in accordance with relevant law;
* A code or codes of conduct produced by an association or other body approved by the Information Commissioner;
