### [](#your-california-privacy-rights)12.1. Your California privacy rights

The CCPA grants consumers whose information is governed by the CCPA the following rights:

* **Information.** You can request information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months. We have made this information available to California residents without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.
* **Access.** You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.
* **Deletion.** You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.

Like many businesses, we use services that display interest-based ads to users around the web. You can ask us to refrain from sharing your information with third parties to help us advertise to other users like you. In addition, you can limit the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies, by following instructions in the [Online tracking opt-out section](#online-tracking-opt-out) above.

You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.

Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.

### [](#how-users-in-california-can-exercise-their-rights)12.2. How users in California can exercise their rights

You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:

* **Identity verification.** We will need to confirm your identity and California residency to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
* **Authorized agents.** California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.
