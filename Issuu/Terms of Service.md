[](#applicable-law-venue-and-arbitration)20\. Applicable law, Venue and Arbitration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20.1 Governing Law; Venue.

20.1.1 These Terms and any action arising out of these Terms or your use of ISSUU, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles but without depriving you of the preceptive protection you enjoy in the country where you live or usually resides.

20.2 **Enforceability**

20.3 If any or all of the below arbitration agreement provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the below arbitration agreement provision will be void and, in that case, you and Issuu agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

20.4 **Internal dispute resolution**

20.4.1 Issuu has established an internal dispute resolution board ("Resolution Board") that will hear your complaint free of charge. The Resolution Board is comprised by an Issuu executive and an external expert, normally our local lawyer.

20.4.2 You may submit your complaint to the Resolution Board using the e-mail disputeresolution@issuu.com.

20.4.3 The Resolution Board will normally within 30 days after having received your complaint and all relevant information decide your complaint. The Resolution Board' s decision is binding upon Issuu. The Resolution Board may meet your complaint in whole or in part or it may reject it.

20.4.4 When deciding your complaint the Resolution Board will take into account the consumers rights that you may hold but it will primarily use the principle of bono and equity to reach a decision.

20.4.5 You will receive the decision from the external member of the Resolution Board. If your complaint is not meet, you will receive an explanation of why it is not meet and a guide to who will hear your complaint and the implications of submitting your complaint to either the below mentioned arbitration or the competent court.

20.5 **Arbitration**

20.5.1 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Issuu in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Issuu agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms and the use of ISSUU will be resolved by binding arbitration if you decide to refer the matter to arbitration.

20.5.2 Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.

20.5.3 Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.

20.5.4 **You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Issuu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to to participate in a class action**

20.5.5 You and Issuu agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

20.5.6 Any arbitration between you and Issuu will be governed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") **Consumer Arbitration Rules** in their entirety.

20.5.6.1 You may find the rules here (the AAA Rules):

20.5.6.2 You can find the forms you need to demand arbitration proceedings on [www.adr.org](https://issuu.com/legal/www.adr.org).

20.5.7 If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, and provided that you first have submitted your complaint/claim to our Resolution Board for resolution, Issuu will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for greater than $ 25,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.

20.5.8 **Modifications**

20.5.8.1 Issuu will not make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Issuu's address for notice), unless required to do so by a change to the AAA rules or changes to the applicable regulation.

20.5.9 No Class Actions. YOU AND ISSUU AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

20.5.10 **Opt-out Deadline**

20.5.10 Further, unless both you and Issuu agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER ABOVE WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Opt- Out Deadline"). You may opt out of the waiver by mailing written notification to Issuu at the address stated at the end of these Terms. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not agree to the class action waiver. Your decision to opt-out will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Issuu. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid. Neither you, nor any other user of the Issuu Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
