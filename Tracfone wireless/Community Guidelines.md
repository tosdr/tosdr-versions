Accountability

Socialresponsibility

We have work because our customers valueour high-quality communications services.

We deliver superior customer experiences through our products and our actions.Everything we do we build on a strong network, systems and process foundation.The quality and reliability of the products we deliver are paramount. Customerspay us to provide them with services that they can rely on.



We focus outward on the customer, not inward.

We make it easy for customers to do business with us, by listening, anticipating andresponding to their needs. We know our products and can explain them to customers.We focus on fundamental execution. We are accountable and we follow through witha sense of urgency. We know that having the highest ethical standards is a competitiveadvantage.



We know teamwork enables us to serveour customers better and faster.

We embrace diversity and personal development not only because it’s the rightthing to do, but also because it’s smart business. We are driven not by ego but byaccomplishments. We keep our commitments to each other and our customers. Ourword is our contract. We respect and trust one another, communicating openly, candidlyand directly since any other way is unfair and a waste of time. We voice our opinion andexercise constructive dissent, and then rally around the agreed-upon action with our fullsupport. Any one of us can deliver a view or idea to anyone else, and listen to and valueanother s view regardless of title or level. Ideas live and die on their merits rather thanwhere they were invented.



We believe integrity is at the core of who we are.

It establishes the trust that is critical to the relationships we have. We are committedto do the right thing and follow sound business practices in dealing with our customers,suppliers, owners and competitors. Our competitors are not enemies; they arechallengers who drive us to improve. We are good corporate citizens and share oursuccess with the community to make the world in which we work better than it wasyesterday.



We know that bigness is not our strength,best is our strength.

Bureaucracy is an enemy. We fight every day to stay “small” and keep bureaucracyout. We are more agile than companies a fraction of our size, because we act fast andtake risks every day. We see crisis and change as opportunities, not threats. We run toa crisis, not away. Change energizes us. We work hard, take action and take personalaccountability for getting things done. Our actions produce measurable results.



Everything we do is built on the strong foundationof our corporate values.

We work 24x7 because our customers depend on us 24x7. We know our bestwas good for today. Tomorrow we’ll do better.

Introduction1



My manager is directing me to violatethe expense policy. I am concernedthat she will retaliate against me ifI report her. What do I do?

You should report the manager’smisconduct. Retaliation againstemployees who report concernsis strictly prohibited, and if you haveconcerns about retaliation, you mustreport those as well. In addition,you have the option of making ananonymous report to Verizon Ethics.

We are defined by our values: integrity, respect, performance excellence, accountability,and social responsibility. These values should guide us in how we deal with every problemat work, large and small. The Code of Conduct gives us detailed guidance about how toapply Verizon’s values to specific issues and challenges that arise in our jobs.

Violations of this Code, or any other Verizon policy, can lead to discipline upto and including termination of employment.

But following the Code of Conduct is just a starting point. We’re all expected to helpmaintain and promote the culture of integrity that is one of Verizon’s greatest competitiveadvantages. A critical part of maintaining a culture of integrity is making sure that eachof us asks questions and raises concerns. If you do this, you can help the company spotissues before they turn into problems. Reporting misconduct or ethics concerns isn’t justan option – it’s each employee’s responsibility. You must report suspected misconductand violations of the Code.

Employees in supervisory roles have a special duty to set the right example. Supervisorsmust promote an open door culture in which employees are comfortable speakingtheir mind. Verizon prohibits retaliation against employees for submitting complaints orcooperating with investigations, and anyone engaging in retaliation is subject to discipline,up to and including termination of employment. If you believe that you or anyone else isthe subject of retaliation for reporting misconduct or cooperating with an investigation,you must report it to the Legal Department, Verizon Ethics, or Human Resources.

If your local laws conflict with the Code of Conduct or your business unit has morerestrictive policies or practices, you must comply with the local law or the unit’s policyor practice.

15Verizon Code of ConductIntegrity and fairnessin the workplace.



I am a Vice President and one ofmy reports disclosed a personalconflict of interest to me. I promptlyimplemented controls to minimize therisk. Is that sufcient?

No. All conflicts and potential conflictsof interest must be cleared by VerizonEthics.



I work with several vendors andwanted to introduce them to mycollege-age daughter, who is lookingfor a summer internship. She’s veryqualified, and would be a tremendousasset to any of the vendors. Can I askthe vendors to meet with her about aninternship?

If you work with a vendor, asking thatvendor for personal favors is generallyprohibited. Here, it is not okay to askthe vendor to consider one of yourrelatives for a position, even a summerinternship. The request could createthe appearance of favoritism and placeinappropriate pressure on the vendor.



Integrity andfairness in theworkplace.



Our company’s reputation is based on the actions of its employees. Each of us mustact with integrity and respect at all times.



Conflicts of interest



You must avoid any relationships or activity that might impair, or even appear to impair,your ability to make objective and fair decisions when performing your job. When actingon behalf of the company, you must advance the company’s legitimate interests whenthe opportunity to do so arises. If you identify a situation where the company’s interestsare being harmed, you must report the matter to Verizon Ethics.

You must never use Verizon property or information for personal gain or take personaladvantage of any opportunity that arises in your work for Verizon.

You must disclose any potential or actual conflict to Verizon Ethics as soon as youbecome aware of it.



Personal conflicts of interest



Certain types of personal relationships can create actual or apparent conflictsof interest both internally at Verizon and in our interactions with third parties. Never useyour position at the company to improperly advance your personal interests or those of afriend or relative.

Internally, you may not supervise – directly or indirectly – someone with whom you sharea close personal relationship, such as anyone in your family or household, or someonewith whom you have or had a romantic relationship or other similar relationship. Even if afamily member or romantic partner is not in your reporting chain, if you interact with sucha person as part of your Verizon work responsibilities, you must avoid any actions at workthat could create even the appearance of a conflict of interest. If you are uncertain aboutwhat interactions are appropriate, you must contact Verizon Ethics.

Externally, you may not participate in the selection process for, have discretionaryauthority involving Verizon’s business with, or supervise Verizon’s relationship with,a company that does business with Verizon if it employs someone with whom youhave a close personal relationship or is a company with which you have a businessrelationship. Exceptions to this restriction are extremely limited and require theapproval of Verizon Ethics.

16Verizon Code of Conduct



How do I find out if the companywhere I have a second job is providingservices that are also provided byVerizon?

Verizon provides a wide array ofproducts and services. Many areobvious, including telephone, internet,and television service. However, Verizonprovides many other services, and ifyou think there is any chance that anoutside employer might be operatingin the same space as Verizon, you mustcontact Verizon Ethics for guidance.



My supervisor knows that I have a sidejob designing apps for mobile devices.Do I have to let anyone else know?

A “side hustle” related to the field inwhich you work for Verizon, or involvingany product or service in which Verizonmight be active, must be approved byVerizon Ethics.



I have been asked to participate inan investor expert network as a techindustry professional. This expertnetwork does research to assistinvestors. If I do not reveal anyconfidential Verizon information, can Iparticipate?

Employees and executives are generallyprohibited from participating in expertnetworks for investors due to insidertrading concerns. You should consultwith Verizon Ethics regarding thisrequest.

Integrity and fairnessin the workplace.

If a family member or person with whom you have a close personal relationshipis employed by an entity that does business with Verizon, you cannot interactwith that individual about business between Verizon and the outside entity.



Outside employment



You may not—with or without compensation—be self-employed or employed by,consult with, own, perform services for, or aid:

• a company or organization (including a charitable organization) that is a vendor,supplier, partner, contractor, subcontractor, or competitor of Verizon; or• a company that provides services that are provided by Verizon, or that Verizonis seeking to provide.

Outside work must not interfere with your work for Verizon or have any connection to thecompany (for example, soliciting coworkers for business or investments). This limitationalso applies to simultaneous employment by Verizon and its subsidiaries, afliates, andjoint ventures in which the company maintains an ownership interest. Exceptions to therequirements of the previous paragraph may be granted only upon written approval byVerizon Ethics.

Unless you receive the prior written approval of your supervisor and Human Resources,you may not engage in any outside employment or self-employment or perform anycommercially-related services—with or without compensation—while absent from workon any company-approved leave of absence, absence due to sickness or disability,Family Medical Leave, or comparable leave provided for by applicable law.



Outside activities



When employees participate in outside activities, Verizon draws a distinction betweenpersonal activities (not representing Verizon) and service on behalf of the company(representing Verizon). Many employees, in their personal capacities, participate inoutside civic and charitable activities by serving as trustees or members of variouscommunity organizations such as local not-for-profits, religious institutions, parentteacher associations, or homeowners’ associations. If a matter regarding Verizon’sservices or products arises when performing such outside civic or charitable activities,you must remove yourself from discussing or voting on the matter or on any matterthat involves the interests of Verizon or its competitors to avoid conflicts of interest,such as whether your organization should select Verizon phone service, or purchase acompetitor’s products rather than Verizon’s. Participation in outside civic or charitableactivities should not interfere with your work for Verizon. To the extent your participationinfringes on company time or involves the use of Verizon resources, your supervisor’sapproval is required.

Service in an outside organization on behalf of Verizon means that you are expectedto represent Verizon’s interests when participating in the organization’s activities. Priorto serving as a representative of Verizon with any outside organization, you must obtainthe prior approval of Verizon Ethics and your vice president level supervisor.

Special approval requirements apply when seeking to serve on any outside company’sBoard of Directors:

• Service on the Board of Directors of a public corporation must be approved inadvance by both Verizon Ethics and your organization’s executive vice president.• Service on the Board of Directors of a non-public corporation must be approvedin advance by Verizon Ethics.

17Verizon Code of ConductIntegrity and fairnessin the workplace.



Political interactions and contributions



The company encourages us to participate in the political process and each of us isresponsible for ensuring compliance with all laws and regulations relating to interactionswith government ofcials, including laws governing campaign finance, governmentethics, and lobbying. In addition, all lobbying activities on behalf of the company must beauthorized by the Public Policy and Legal Department.

If you are appearing before a government body or engaging in contact with a publicofcial outside of your ordinary work duties regarding a business in which Verizon isengaged or a business issue in which Verizon has an interest, make it clear that youare not representing Verizon and advise your supervisor in advance.

Your personal political contributions and activities must be kept separate from thecompany. If you make political contributions, you may not refer to your employmentor use the company’s assets, including its name, in connection with your contributions,unless required to do so by law. You may not make payments of corporate contributions,whether monetary or non-monetary assets, to any domestic or foreign political party,candidate, campaign, or public ofcial unless that contribution is permitted underapplicable laws inside and outside the U.S., and approved in advance by the Public Policyand Legal Department. In addition, you may never reimburse anyone for any politicalcontribution.

Verizon and its subsidiaries administer Political Action Committees (PACs) that acceptcontributions from employees who wish to support Verizon’s goals through the politicalprocess. Your personal contributions to these PACs are entirely voluntary.



Seeking public ofce



Before you seek any elected or appointed public ofce, including a local position,such as school board, you must obtain the approval of your director level or abovesupervisor and Verizon Ethics.



Insider trading and securities transactions



Insider trading occurs when a person trades in a company’s securities using materialinside information—that is, information that is not publicly available and that couldreasonably afect a person’s decision about whether to buy or sell the securities.It also occurs when a person gives material inside information to someone else whotrades on it. Insider trading is a serious violation of the law and can result in severepenalties, including imprisonment.

As a Verizon employee, you may become aware of material inside information aboutVerizon or other companies with which Verizon does business. You must never usematerial inside information (even if you acquired it as a “tip” from others) to trade inVerizon’s or any other company’s securities, including options and other derivativesecurities. In addition, you may not provide material inside information to any otherperson, including members of your family or your friends, or assist any other personin trading using material inside information.

18Verizon Code of ConductIntegrity and fairnessin the workplace.



Can I purchase stock in a companythat is a vendor on a project I amworking on?

associated with quasi-governmentalentities and state-owned companies.If you’re in doubt as to whethersomeone should be treated as a

government official, contact the Legal

Department for assistance.

Often, it is unlawfulto engage in business with the listed entity or entities that are owned or controlled by thelisted entity.
