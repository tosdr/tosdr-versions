If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of NBCUniversal’s use or disclosure of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so in the footer or settings menu of the brand with which you engage by selecting “Your Privacy Choices” link.

You may still receive advertising, including personalized ads based on NBCUniversal data on the Services. On some of our websites and applications when you click the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the website footer or in the application settings menu, you will be shown a tool that allows you to opt out of the online “sales” and sharing/processing of personal information for targeted ads on the website and application.  Please note, if you use different browsers, devices, or services you will need to make your elections separately. In some cases, you may also be presented with form field to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. In other cases, you will be directed to this page where we provide additional information and options for you to learn more about your choices and how to opt out from interest-based advertising more broadly.

Please note, if we do not detect that you are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia, the opt out of sale or sharing/processing for targeted advertising data choices will not apply even if you take the actions described above. 

Please note that if you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law.  
 

**Sensitive Data**

We may use certain sensitive personal information as allowable by law for purposes including analytics and to enable marketing to you and the delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites, such displaying an ad relevant to your precise location data.  

* You can change your precise geolocation permissions for our mobile apps in your mobile device settings.

****Incentive Programs (California Residents Only)****

The Services may offer opportunities to receive certain services or benefits such as discounts or free or extended services (such as bonus streaming time or additional videos), which may require the provision of personal information. Such opportunities could be considered a financial incentive under applicable law (each, an “Incentive Program”).  When you participate in an Incentive Program, you agree to the terms of that Incentive Program, and may revoke your participation depending on the Incentive Program (e.g., by opting out of emails or terminating a streaming service). To the extent we can determine the value of your information, we consider the value of providing you with a more personalized experience as well as the expenses we incur in providing Incentive Programs that are reasonably related to the costs associated with offering the Incentives.

**Third Parties List – Shine the Light (California Residents only)**

California residents can also request a list of all the third parties to which we have disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California’s Shine the Light law) during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

You will need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident.

We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law.
