If you replace, change or upgrade your browser or device, or delete your cookies, you may need to use these opt-out tools again. As some Cookie-management solutions also rely on Cookies, please adjust your browser Cookie settings carefully, following the relevant instructions below.

**Browser Controls:** You may be able to disable and manage some Cookies through your browser settings. If you use multiple browsers on the same device, you will need to manage your settings for each browser. Please click on any of the below browser links for instructions:

If the browser you use is not listed above, please refer to your browser’s help menu for information on how to manage Cookies. Please be aware that disabling cookies will not disable other analytics tools we may use to collect information about you or your use of our Services. 

**Analytics Provider Opt-Outs:** To disable analytics Cookies you can use the browser controls discussed above or, for some of our providers, you can use their individual opt-out mechanisms: 

* [Google and Google Products’ (such as YouTube API Services) Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google Analytics Opt-Out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
* [Omniture’s Privacy Policy](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html) and [Omniture’s Opt-Out](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html)

After you opt out, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be as relevant to you. 

**Mobile Settings:** You may manage the collection of information for interest-based advertising purposes in mobile apps via the device’s settings, including managing the collection of location data. To opt out of mobile ad tracking from Nielsen or other third parties, you can do so by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (for Android devices) options in your device settings.

**Connected Devices:** For connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, you should review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking.  Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like “limit ad tracking” or to disable options such as “interest-based advertising,” “interactive TV,” or “smart interactivity”.  These settings vary by device type.  

**Cross-Device Tracking:** If you would like to opt out of our browser-based cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, you may do so by using the various methods described above.  You must opt out separately on each device and each browser that you use. For more information about cross-device matching, please visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/DAA_Cross-Device_Guidance-Final.pdf). If you opt out of cross-device tracking for advertising purposes, we may still conduct cross-device tracking for other purposes, such as analytics. 

**Consequences of Deactivation of Cookies:** If you disable or remove Cookies, some parts of the Services may not function properly. Information may still be collected and used for other purposes, such as research, online services analytics or internal operations, and to remember your opt-out preferences.
