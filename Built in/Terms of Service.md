**5.1** In no event will Built In, its contractors, suppliers, content-providers, and other similar entities, and the officers, directors, managers, members, employees, representatives, and agents of each of the foregoing (collectively, our “Contractors”), be liable to you or any third party for any losses or damages, alleged under any legal theory, arising out of or in connection with: (a) your use of, or reliance on, the Services in a way not contemplated by these Terms; (b) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of other users of the Services; or (c) your gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In a jurisdiction that does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain damages, the liability of Built In and the Contractors will be limited in accordance with these Terms to the extent permitted by law.

**5.3** Without limiting any of the foregoing, if Built In or any of the Contractors are found liable to you or to any third party as a result of any claims or other matters arising under or in connection with these Terms, the Site, or your use of the Site, the maximum liability for all such claims and other matters will not exceed $100 in any calendar year.
