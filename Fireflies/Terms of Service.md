security of such data, but Fireflies is not liable for any loss or harm resulting from the user's use of AI or

similar technologies. By utilizing Fireflies' services, the user understands and accepts the risks involved

7. Termination and Suspension



You may cancel and delete your Account at any time by either using the features on the Services to do so

(if applicable and available) or by written notice to support@fireflies.ai. After cancellation your profile will

be purged and, you will no longer have access to your Account, your profile or any other information

through the Services. The provisions of these Terms of Service which by their intent or meaning intended

to survive such termination, including without limitation the provisions relating to disclaimer of

warranties, limitations of liability, and indemnification, shall survive any termination of these Terms of

Service and any termination of your use of or subscription to the Services and shall continue to apply

indefinitely.



At any time and for any reason, we have the right to deny access to the Services to anybody. If Fireflies is

investigating you or believes you have violated any of the terms of this Agreement, we may prevent you

from accessing the Services or restrict how much of them you can use. We'll inform you in writing or by

email. This notice of termination or limitation shall be effective immediately. You cannot register for and

create a new Account in the name of a third party, a fake or borrowed name, or your own identity if

Fireflies terminates or restricts your ability to use the Services due to this section, even if you are acting

on their behalf.



Even after your right to use the Services is terminated or limited, this Agreement will remain enforceable

against you. Fireflies reserves the right to take appropriate legal action, including but not limited to

pursuing arbitration in accordance with Section 14 of these Terms of Service.



Fireflies reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the

Services at its sole discretion. Fireflies is not liable to you for any modification or discontinuance of all or

any portion of the Services. Fireflies has the right to restrict anyone from completing registration as a user

if Fireflies believes such a person may threaten the safety and integrity of the Services, or if, in Fireflies’

discretion, such restriction is necessary to address any other reasonable business concern.



Following the termination or cancellation of your Account (as defined below), we reserve the right to

delete all your data, including any User Content, in the normal course of operation. Your data cannot be

recovered once your Account is terminated or canceled.



8. Links to Third-Party Websites



From time to time, the app may have links to sites outside of it. These sites may have links to offers and

promotions from third parties. We put these in so that you can find information, products, or services that

you might find helpful or interesting. We are not responsible for what is on these sites or what they offer,

and we can't promise that they will always be up and running. Just because we have links to these other

sites doesn't mean that we support or work with the people who run or promote them.



The terms and conditions of use and privacy policies for any website controlled, owned, or run by a third

party tell you how to use that website. You use these websites run by other people at your own risk.

Fireflies makes it clear that it is not responsible for anything that happens because you use or look at

websites or other content linked from the Services. You agree to not hold Fireflies responsible for anything

that might happen if you click on a link on the Services.



As part of the way the Services work, you can link your Account with online accounts you may have with

third-party service providers like Google (each such account, a "Third-Party Account") by either: I

providing your Third-Party Account login information through the Services; or (ii) allowing Fireflies to

access your Third-Party Account, as permitted by the terms and conditions that govern your use of each

Third-Party Account. You promise that you have the right to give Fireflies your Third-Party Account login

information and/or give Fireflies access to your Third-Party Account, without breaking any of the terms

and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without requiring Fireflies

to pay any fees or making Fireflies subject to any usage limits set by such third-party service providers. By

giving Fireflies access to any Third-Party Accounts, you agree to the following: (1) Fireflies may access,

make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-

Party Account ("SNS Content") so that it is available on and through the Services via your Account,

including, but not limited to, any friend lists; and (2) Fireflies may send and receive additional information

to your Third-Party Account to the extent you are no longer the account holder. Unless these Terms of

Service say something different, all SNS content, if any, is considered to be User Content. Depending on

the Third-Party Accounts you choose and the privacy settings you've made in those Third-Party Accounts,

personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and

through your Account on the Services. Please note that SNS Content may no longer be available on and

through the Services if a Third-Party Account or an associated service becomes unavailable or if Fireflies'

access to a Third-Party Account is cut off by the third-party service provider. As explained below, you will

be able to turn off the link between your Account on the Services and your Third-Party Accounts at any

time. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH

YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY

PROVIDERS. Fireflies doesn't try to check any SNS Content for accuracy, legality, or lack of infringement,

among other things, and Fireflies isn't responsible for any SNS Content.

WE DO NOT GIVE YOU ANY KIND OF WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE FIREFLIES

SERVICES WE GIVE YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS INCLUDES ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF

MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT AND CANNOT PROMISE THAT

FIREFLIES SERVICES WILL WORK WITHOUT PROBLEMS OR THAT SOME OR ALL OF THEM WILL BE UP AND

RUNNING ALL THE TIME. YOU AGREE THAT OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR

CONTRACTORS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL

DAMAGES RELATED TO OR CAUSED BY ANY FIREFLIES SERVICES AND PRODUCTS PROVIDED UNDER THIS

AGREEMENT OR BY YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO FIREFLIES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA,

.



13. Indemnification



You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fireflies and its officers, directors, employees,

agents, attorneys, insurers, successors and assigns (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and

all Liabilities incurred in connection with (i) your use or inability to use the Services, or

(ii) your breach or violation of this Agreement; (iii) your violation of any law, or the rights of any user or

third party and (iv) any content submitted by you or using your Account to the Services, including, but not

limited to the extent such content may infringe on the intellectual rights of a third party or otherwise be

illegal or unlawful. You also agree to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for any Liabilities resulting from

your use of software robots, spiders, crawlers, or similar data gathering and extraction tools, or any other

action you take that imposes an unreasonable burden or loan on our infrastructure. Fireflies reserves the

right, in its own sole discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control at its own expense of any

matter otherwise subject to your indemnification. You will not, in any event, settle any claim or matter

without the prior written consent of Fireflies.



14. Dispute Resolution – Arbitration \& Class Action Waiver



PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND

FIREFLIES CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION,

REQUIRE YOU AND FIREFLIES TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL

ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.



You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to your use of the Services, you

will contact us at support@fireflies.ai and you and Fireflies will attempt in good faith to negotiate a

written resolution of the matter directly. You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for 30 days after

notification (via certified mail or personal delivery), such matter will be deemed a “Dispute” as defined

below. Except for the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief described under the “Binding

Arbitration” section below, should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions

without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be

entitled to recover attorneys' fees, even if you may have been entitled to them otherwise.

Binding Arbitration. You and Fireflies agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating

to this Agreement or to your use of the Services (collectively “Disputes”) will be settled by binding

arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court

of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation

of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. This

means that you and Fireflies both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, you may bring a claim against Fireflies in “small claims” court, instead of by arbitration, but

only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an individual, non-

class, and non-representative basis, and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an

individual, non-class, and non-representative basis.

Class Action Waiver. You and Fireflies agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will be conducted on an

individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that you and Fireflies

both agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action

proceeding. Further, unless you and Fireflies agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute

may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of class action

proceeding.



Arbitration Administration and Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association

(“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer

Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution’ section. (The AAA

Rules are available at http://www.adr.orgor by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).

Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other party with a

written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge

or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from

the AAA’s roster of arbitrators with relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an

arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the

arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules.



Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Fireflies agree otherwise, the seat of the arbitration

shall be in San Francisco, California. If your claim does not exceed USD$10,000, then the arbitration will
