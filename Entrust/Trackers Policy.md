Cookie Policy
=============

**Last updated: January 3, 2024**

When you visit our websites, these sites may ask your browser to store a small text file, called a cookie, on your device. Cookies are designed to allow a website to recognize its users on subsequent visits and to remember information about those users. Cookies have different purposes and can be used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, provide you with relevant content and advertisements, and help you navigate between pages more efficiently. In this policy, the term “cookie” is also meant to refer to other similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixels, scripts).

First Party vs. Third Party Cookies
-----------------------------------

First party cookies are cookies that only track user activities on the domain where they were created. Entrust uses first party cookies for essential site functionality, analytics, and personalization. Third party cookies are from a domain outside of Entrust. We use third party cookies for advertising and marketing.

×

Session vs. Persistent Cookies
------------------------------

Session cookies are temporary and expire once your browsing session ends. Persistent cookies remain on your device until their expiration date or when you delete the cookie.

Categories of Cookies
---------------------

* **Essential:** Essential cookies are necessary for our website to function. They allow visitors to move around our website and use its basic features, such as accessing secure areas of the website, opening navigation, and displaying content. Essential cookies cannot be disabled. These are persistent cookies set directly by Entrust. 
* **Targeted Advertising:** Targeted Advertising cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests. They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These are both session and persistent cookies set by third parties.
* **Personalization:** Personalization cookies allow us to remember choices you make (such as your language selection or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features for you. These could be both session or persistent cookies set directly by Entrust.
* **Analytics:** Analytics cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources to our websites so that we can measure and improve the performance of our site. Analytics let us know which pages are the most and least popular and us to see how visitors move around our sites. These cookies also help us to identify whether there are technical issues on our sites. All information collected from analytics cookies is aggregated and anonymous. These are both session and persistent cookies set by Entrust.

Managing Cookies
----------------

You can prevent the setting of cookies, manage cookies, and delete cookies in your browser settings. If you choose to change your settings, you may find that certain functions and features of our website will not work as intended. Therefore, it is not recommended that you disable cookies in your browser settings. Although we do not recommend disabling cookies in your browser settings, your privacy is important to us and we encourage you to customize your cookie preferences using our cookie consent tool.
