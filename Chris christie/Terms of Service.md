Notice at Collection of Personal Information

Notice at Collection of Personal Information

In order to enhance your overall user experience, we collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information (“Personal Information”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-Personal Information”). Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.

**Personal Information**: We may collect personal information you voluntarily provide to us including, but not limited to your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, mobile number and geographic location. You may provide this information when you request information, register, make a purchase or for other purposes. We may also collect demographic information such as gender, date of birth, occupation, employer name and zip code. In limited circumstances, we may collect payment information such as credit card number where needed to complete a requested service or transaction.

**Non-Personal Information**: We may also collect non-personally identifiable information that is generated automatically while you are visiting the Site or elsewhere on the Internet when our advertisements are served, also known as log files. This data includes, but is not limited to, information such as IP address, web pages visited before and after visiting the Site, date and time, domain type, type of mobile device you use, your device’s unique ID, web pages you view and links you click on within the Site and interactions with our advertisements delivered by us or advertisements delivered by a third party advertising technology vendor. This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and pixels. An IP address, for example, is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices used to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit the Site, we may view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand from what regions of the world the Site visitors come. We also may use your non-personally identifiable information to enhance the Site.

We do not collect any Personal Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) register your email address with us; (b) enter contests sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) send email messages, submit forms or transmit other information by telephone or letter to us through our site; or (d) submit your credit card or other payment information when making a contribution or purchase on our site. We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.

In addition, we may also collect, or our third-party servers and/or providers may collect, certain Non-Personal Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information. Our third-party providers may also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many users interacted with or clicked on certain content on the site, along with aggregate data about the types of users who interacted with that content.

We will primarily use your Personal Information to provide our content to you as requested when you submit that Personal Information. We will also use Personal Information you submit for purposes that include, but are not necessarily limited to, enhancing the operation of our site and our emails, completing transactions as necessary, improving our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyzing site use, improving our content offerings, and customizing our site’s content, layout, and services. We may use Personal Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personal Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you.

For additional information, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://chrischristie.com/privacy/). Additionally, you may request that we refrain from selling your personal information here: [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](https://chrischristie.com/opt-out/).
