Introduction



eCare Vault, Inc. (“eCare Vault,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides a combination of modular technology

solutions and expert advisory services to support public sector entities and their constituents. eCare Vault

may work with such entities in one of three ways, or all: (1) by supporting employees with workplace well-

being and skills and career progression, (2) by supporting clients and families with collaboration tools for

empowerment, transition, skills training, and self-sufficiency (collectively, the “Program”), and/or (3) by

supporting students’ well-being with collaboration tools and supports. The Program is sponsored by the

entity with which you are associated (the “Sponsor”), either as an employee, client, or family member.



The Program provides you with a personalized digital platform for managing your Program

participation that you can access through our website or mobile application. You may collaborate with

certain individuals associated with your Sponsor (the “Team Captains”) and provide or obtain certain

services from others associated with your Sponsor. The digital and non-digital components of the Program

are collectively referred to as the “Service” or “Services.” By registering as an eCare Vault participant or

otherwise accessing our Services, you are entering into a legally binding contract with us. The following

Terms of Service (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of our Services.



In certain cases, you will be managing Program participation on behalf of other individuals (see below,

“Creating User Account/Managing Participation on Behalf of Others”).



Before accessing our Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understand these Terms, and

that you agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use or access

our Services.

You have the option to accept an invitation to join a team (“Care Team”) with other members in your

organization. If you elect to do so, the Team’s Captain or Co-captains may invite others to join the Care Team

(“Team Members”). You may choose to exit a Care Team at any time.



The Program includes a variety of ways you may be able to communicate with other Team Members,

including group discussions and communications, photos, and other similar communication channels

(“Communication Channels”). Whenever you communicate using any Communication Channel you agree to

follow these engagement rules:



1. You are prohibited from sharing any information about other Team Members outside of the Care

Team without the prior written consent of such Team Member.

2. Respect other Team Members and avoid posting comments which are offensive to others. Material

that is defamatory, discriminatory, racist, sexist or otherwise offensive is not welcome.

messages.

you should be responsible and mature in your participation.

grounds for termination of your Account and may be reported to your Sponsor, depending on the

a. comments that threaten, harass or bully another person;

b. personal or confidential information of anyone other than yourself;

c. sharing another Team Member’s personal information;

d. links that might be considered spam;

e. nudity, pornography or profanity;

f. misleading information;

g. deceptive conduct;

h. comments that encourage or incite violence; and

i. any content to which you do not own the intellectual property rights.



We are under no obligation to monitor or administer the Communication Channels; however, we retain

the right to delete any posts or comments that do not meet the above criteria, and take further action, as

we deem necessary, to prevent future incidents. Please notify us at help@ecarevault.com if you are

concerned another Team Member has violated these rules.

Creating User Account/Providing Information on Behalf of Others



In certain cases, you will be managing Program participation on behalf of other individuals (for example,

provide services (“Service Recipients”). In such circumstances, you and your Sponsor are solely responsible

for obtaining all necessary authorizations and consents from the Service Recipients required under all

appliable privacy laws for the collection, international transfer (if applicable) and subsequent disclosure of

such the Service Recipients’ personal data, including with a Care Team you join on behalf of such Care

Recipient. You acknowledge and agree such authorizations and consents will be obtained prior to you

creating an account or disclosing any information about a Care Recipient.



Communications From Us

communicate with you related to your participation in the Program. If your Program participation is
