### How we store Passwords

All our registration and login systems use salted password hashing. When you create an account to our service, product or website, the password is stored in the database using a secure hash algorithm (not MD5) and we use different salts to protect your password from being cracked. At no point is the plain-text (unencrypted) password ever written to the hard drive. We recommend to use a long password because most short passwords can easily be cracked, a password of at least 12 or better 15+ characters is much harder to crack, of course you should include also special characters and symbols.
