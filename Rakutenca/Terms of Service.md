Please read these Terms and Conditions (‚ÄúTerms and Conditions‚Äù or ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) carefully. This agreement affects your rights.

Ebates Canada, Inc. dba Rakuten Rewards Canada (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äù) makes available shopping programs (‚ÄúPrograms‚Äù) through www.rakuten.ca and related mobile and software applications (‚ÄúCompany Properties‚Äù) under these Terms and Conditions. Company is part of the Rakuten Group, which includes the affiliates and subsidiaries of our parent company, Rakuten Group, Inc., based in Tokyo, Japan.

This Agreement constitutes a legally binding agreement between each individual who enrolls in any of the Programs (‚ÄúMember‚Äù) or otherwise uses any one of the Company Properties. If you are a Member or use any of the Company Properties, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY All OF ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DISCONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN AND USE OF THE PROGRAM(S) AND TERMINATE YOUR PROGRAM ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY.

YOU AGREE TO THE MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISIONS, DESCRIBED FULLY IN SECTION 4 BELOW, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY, EXCEPT FOR THOSE MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL-CLAIMS COURT IN THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 23.2.

### 1\. CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.1 Company may at its discretion modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Each such modification will take immediate effect upon notification to you. Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions, by website, email, regular mail, text message, in-app messaging, or other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed.

1.2 Your continued use of the Company Property following any such notifications constitutes your acceptance of such modifications and your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, your sole remedy is to terminate your Account by accessing your Account‚Äôs Privacy Preferences. The most current version of these Terms and Conditions will be available on our website and supersedes previous versions.

### 2\. PROGRAM ACCOUNT

2.1 Our Programs are not available to and should not be accessed or used by residents outside of Canada. To become a Member, you must be at least 18 years old and provide your email address and password for Company to create your Program account (‚ÄúAccount‚Äù). Each person is limited to one Account. To redeem certain offers and promotions and use services offered by our other Programs, you may elect to provide us additional information. Information that you submit through one of our Programs may be saved and available for your use in our other Programs, including, without limitation, any saved payment card information. Any and all information collected from you shall be subject to our [Privacy Policy.](https://www.rakuten.ca/help/privacy-policy) which is hereby incorporated by reference.

### 3\. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION

3.1 We would like an opportunity to address your concerns without a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Company, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by submitting your request through our [Member Services](https://www.rakuten.ca/help/contact/other) page. Please be sure to select ‚ÄúOther‚Äù under Email Topic in your request. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you in writing via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission through this form, you or Company may bring a formal proceeding.

### 4\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER

4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company‚Äôs business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company‚Äôs employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in provincial or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator‚Äôs decision is subject to limited review by courts.

4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. You further agree that the law of the province or territory in which you reside shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

4.3 CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person‚Äôs claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the ‚ÄúClass Action Waiver,‚Äù are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.

4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (‚ÄúRules‚Äù). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. Unless you and company expressly agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in English, in the United States of America (U.S.), in the State of California and County of San Francisco.

4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Rakuten Rewards Canada, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, United States of America, Attn: Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.

4.6 This arbitration provision is optional.
