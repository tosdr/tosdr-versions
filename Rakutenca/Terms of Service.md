### 4\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER

4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company’s business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in provincial or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.

4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. You further agree that the law of the province or territory in which you reside shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

4.3 CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.

4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. Unless you and company expressly agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in English, in the United States of America (U.S.), in the State of California and County of San Francisco.

4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Rakuten Rewards Canada, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, United States of America, Attn: Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.

4.6 This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Rakuten Rewards Canada, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, United States of America, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or accessing a Company Property for the first time.

4.7 Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

Company receives compensation for referring buyers to the retailers, brands, merchants and other partners participating in this Program (“Affiliate Stores”).

Participation in this Program and the opportunity to earn Cash Back are offered at the sole discretion of Company and subject to your compliance with this Agreement.

(a)  Online Cash Back. In order to earn Cash Back online, you must register for an Account, be signed in to one of the Company Properties use the shopping links within the Company Properties, and complete your purchase transaction during the same shopping session you started after clicking on the shopping link. If you visit other sites before completing your purchase or use coupons not provided by Company, your purchase might be associated with a service other than Company and you might not earn Cash Back on your purchase. If you disable “cookies” on your computer so that the cookies are not operational when you complete your purchase transaction, you will not be able to earn Cash Back because cookies are used to authenticate the user and verify whose Member Account is eligible for the Cash Back.

The Browser Extension may also alert you of a deal or offer available through www.rakuten.ca with respect to a product or brand appearing in your search results or on other pages you visit across the web, and prompt you to start a shopping session at one of our merchants. If you start a shopping session using the Browser Extension, it will set a cookie (or other similar tracking technologies) on your device through our affiliate network for the purpose of tracking your shopping session and crediting your Cash Back reward — just as if you had begun your shopping experience via any of our links to merchant sites on www.rakuten.ca. Please note, however, that if cookies or other similar tracking devices from other affiliate marketing companies related to that merchant are already present on your computer, the Browser Extension will not automatically overwrite those cookies or shopping session but may still offer you the ability to start a Cash Back shopping session when you arrive at a merchant’s website.

We may also collect information about your shopping behavior for internal testing purposes. Information collected by the Browser Extension for these purposes may include date and time of use, browser type, browser version, URLs of web pages visited, general information about the visited web page, product searches, product search results, information about products added to your shopping cart, and other product information.

23.2 Choice of Law and Venue. The validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement and the relationship between You and Company, including the rights and duties of the parties, will be governed by the laws of the province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to any principles of conflicts of laws that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. This shall not limit the protection afforded to you by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of applicable law. The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in the courts of the United States of America, State of California and County of San Francisco.

Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions, except as otherwise stated.

23.5 Assignment.  You may not assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent, and any such assignment without such consent will be null and void.
