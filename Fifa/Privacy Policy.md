Privacy Policy
==============

1\. Defending your data

Living Football is our commitment to the people who love the beautiful game – and that includes the way we process your personal data. We’re proud that you trust us to look after your data and our team members work hard to keep all personal information safe and secure. When it comes to data, we follow two main laws – the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Swiss Data Protection Act (DPA) – as well as other national data protection legislation in the places where we operate. Click on the boxes to find out more about the law, our policies and how we defend your data at FIFA. We may update this policy from time to time, but you’ll always find the latest information here on our website.

2\. How we look after your data

At FIFA, we always play by the rules. Data protection laws are complex, so all team members who deal with personal data get the right training to make sure they’re match fit when it comes to your information. Our approach is based on the following four data principles – the game plan we all strive to follow when it comes to data:

* We process your data lawfully, fairly and transparently.
    

* We collect data for a specific purpose. Once we’ve fulfilled that purpose, we won’t process your data again.
    

* We keep your data accurate and up to date, only retaining it for as long as we need it.
    

* We keep all personal data confidential, accurate and available.
    

3\. Your rights

* The right to be informed about how we collect and use data
    

* The right to access the data we hold on you

6\. Sharing your data

We sometimes share your data with third parties.

Don’t worry, though – we’ll always keep your data safe. Organisations that process data on FIFA’s behalf play by our rules. They all have to follow this policy as well as any data protection laws.

There may be instances where your data is shared with other stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, clubs, or member associations. These parties may require access to certain personal information for legitimate purposes, such as investigations, security measures, or ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. However, when sharing your data with such stakeholders, we continue to prioritize the protection and security of your information. We strive to work with trusted entities who are bound by our policies and applicable data protection laws to safeguard your data and maintain confidentiality.

7\. When do we share data?

8\. Keeping your data safe

We’ve got all sorts of tactics to keep your data safe and we’re proud of the work our team members do to defend your data. But we can never guarantee that your data is safe from accidental loss and/or unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. To help protect you from identity theft, we will never ask for your credit card information, account credentials or national identification/passport number by email or phone. If you send sensitive information by unencrypted email, there’s always a risk that your data will be intercepted. If you send us an unencrypted email, we’ll take it that you’re happy to accept that risk. If you suspect someone unauthorised is trying to access your data, please get in touch with us at [dataprotection@fifa.org.](https://www.fifa.com/data-protection-portal/dataprotection@fifa.org.)

9\. Updating and deleting your data

You can review, correct, update or change your data at any time. If you ask us to delete your data, we’ll do so unless there’s a legal reason that means we have to keep it. If that’s the case, we’ll let you know.

10\. Children and data

We don’t collect personal data from children under 16. Under-16s should always ask a parent/guardian for permission to use our digital services. We recommend that parents and guardians clear their browser cache of cookies to minimise the personal data collected. If we find out we’ve collected data from a child without permission, we’ll delete it.

11\. Where we process your data

We process information in Switzerland, the European Economic Area (EEA) and other places, depending on the location of our business partners and third parties. That means your data may be processed in places where the data protection laws aren’t as strict as in Switzerland and the EEA. We’ll take all reasonable steps to make sure your information is as safe there as it would be under the DPA and GDPR.

12\. Buying tickets

There’s nothing like the thrill of a FIFA competition – and sometimes, the competition for tickets is almost as fierce as the action on the pitch! When applying for tickets, you agree that your data will be used, processed and stored by FIFA and our third parties. We’ll use your data for things like ticket production, sales, allocation, customer care, safety, security and rights protection. If you consent, we’ll also use your data to tell you about other FIFA products and events, as well as products and services from our third parties.

13\. Cookies

Not just a delicious end-of-game snack, cookies are also small pieces of information stored on your browser when you use our website. You’ll find our Cookie Policy here.

14\. Complaints

If you’d like to submit a query or make a complaint, contact us at [dataprotection@fifa.org](https://www.fifa.com/data-protection-portal/dataprotection@fifa.org).
