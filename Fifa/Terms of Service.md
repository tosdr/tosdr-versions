The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (“**FIFA**”, “**We**”, “**Our**”) is pleased to provide you with its websites (the “**FIFA Websites**”), applications (the “**FIFA Apps**”), ticketing platform (the “**FIFA Ticketing Platform**”), and other digital services, content and software (“**Services**”) (together, hereinafter referred to as “**FIFA Digital Platforms**”). The following Terms of Service and any documents referred to herein (“**Terms**”) apply to all FIFA Digital Platforms, unless stated differently in relation to a specific FIFA Digital Platform.

**1\. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS**

1.1 By accessing, downloading, installing, or using the FIFA Digital Platforms, whether or not you become a registered user (“**User**”, “**You**”, “**Yourself**”, “**Your**”), You agree to be bound by these Terms, which You acknowledge to have read and understood.

1.2 We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these Terms at any time. You must review these Terms at [www.fifa.com/legal/terms-of-service](https://www.fifa.com/legal/terms-of-service) on a regular basis to keep Yourself informed of any changes.

1.3 By using the FIFA Digital Platforms, You agree that the posting of new or revised Terms on or within the FIFA Digital Platforms shall constitute adequate and constructive notice to You of any and all revisions and changes. Continued use of the FIFA Digital Platforms after any such changes or after explicitly accepting the new Terms upon logging into the FIFA Digital Platforms shall constitute Your acceptance of such changes.

1.4 The use of particular Services may be subject to specific terms of service related to the concerned Service. In using such Services, You agree to be bound by the terms then in force. Where there is any inconsistency between the Terms and any other terms of service, those other terms of service shall prevail in respect of the concerned service.

1.5 These Terms also regulate the access and use of the FIFA Ticketing Platform which forms part of the FIFA Website. These Terms do not apply to the purchase, sale or resale of tickets and/or ticket-related products, which shall be governed separately by applicable terms and conditions. You acknowledge that by simply registering to use or by using the FIFA Ticketing Platform, this does not guarantee the availability of, or your eligibility to purchase, tickets and/or ticket-related products.

**2\. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS**

2.1 Certain areas of the FIFA Digital Platforms require [registration](https://www.fifa.com/account/) (“**Restricted Areas**”). By registering, You acknowledge and certify that: (i) You are eligible for an account as set forth in these Terms; and (ii) the information You include as part of the registration process is accurate and not misleading.

If You provide, or FIFA has reasonable grounds to suspect that You have provided, any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or FIFA otherwise reasonably considers that You have failed to comply with any provisions of these Terms, FIFA has the right to suspend or terminate Your account and refuse You any and/or all current or future use of the FIFA Digital Platforms (or any portion thereof).

2.3 In order to use any FIFA Apps, You must have a Google Play Store account, owned and operated by Google Inc., or an Apple ID on the Apple App Store, owned and operated by Apple Inc.
