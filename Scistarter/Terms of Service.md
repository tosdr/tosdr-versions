Terms of Use and ConsentSITE USER AGREEMENT (“Agreement”)Hello and welcome to the SciStarter and/or Science For Citizens website (www.scistarter.com, www.scistarter.org, www.scienceforcitizens.com, the “website(s)” or “Site(s)”) and associated SciStarter, LLC suite of websites, owned and operated by SciStarter, LLC (“SCI” or “us” or “we” or “our”) (Note that SCI also refers to Science For Citizens and Science For Citizens, LLC). We hope that you enjoy your use of this Site(s).What follows is our Agreement (“Agreement”) with you regarding the rules, laws and terms (“Terms Of Use” and "Consent") that govern your use of this website. When we can, we've loosend up the terminology a bit. We think the legal-language is overkill but we are bound by law to include them (says our attorney!).  For example, here's some legal language:  "This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the websites and the service owned and operated by SCI (the “Service”). This agreement applies to all users of the Site(s) or service, including users who are also contributors of content, information, and other materials or services on the Site(s).

We may modify this Agreement from time to time. Privacy Policy and Age Of User: The use of the website(s) is conditioned upon acceptance of all of Terms of Use and Consent, which also incorporates the Privacy Policy available at www.scistarter.com/privacy as well as all other rules, policies and procedures that may be published on the Site(s)(s) by SCI, each of which is incorporated by reference.Use of the Site(s)(s) is available to people who are 13 years old and older or people with permission from an adult. Consent to Research: Academic Research and Informed Consent.  Arizona State University’s Center for Engagement and Training in Science and Society and SciStarter, in partnership with select citizen science projects, are conducting a research study to inform the design and implementation of online functions to help citizen scientists more easily find and get involved in projects and to track contributions to projects. In doing so, we will research and refine development of SciStarter, to foster productive collaborations among citizen scientists and project managers. The research study aims to improve our understanding of advantages and disadvantages of design components of the SciStarter platform based on user experiences by citizen scientists and project owners.  Any reports based on visitors' and account holders' online activites are shared in aggregate and data are not linked to any personally identifyable information. Data collected for this research may involve an examination of how you use SciStarter, solicitation of your experiences with different features of SciStarter, and the collection of some demographic information that will be shared with owners of the citizen science projects in which you participate, only with your explicit permission. Details are available on the SciStarter Privacy Policy page.  As part of research funded by the National Science Foundation for the development of SciStarter, we will also work with other researchers to examine the online patterns of how users navigate the site, search for and bookmark projects, join and display projects, and communicate with project leaders and other citizen scientists. This research helps us better understand citizen scientists and improve the design of SciStarter accordingly. By joining SciStarter, you are consenting to participate in this research. Your activity in SciStarter and all information you provide will be kept confidential (not linked to personally identifiable information) in all reports and publications, unless you explicitly agree to share your identity, but may be shared with the owners of citizen science projects in which you enroll.
