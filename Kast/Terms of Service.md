9. * **Dispute Resolution.**
        
    * 1. General. If a dispute arises between you and the Company, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and the Company agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or the Service (a “Claim”) in accordance with one of the subsections below or as we and you otherwise agree in writing. Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by e-mailing [contact@kastapp.co](mailto:contact@kastapp.co). Other than those matters listed in Section 8.2, you and the Company agree to seek resolution of the dispute only through arbitration of that dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 8, and not litigate any dispute in court. Arbitration means that the dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
        2. Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY THE COMPANY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO PROTECTION OF THE COMPANY’S OR ANY COMPANY LICENSOR’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 8.
        3. RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION 8, YOU MUST NOTIFY THE COMPANY IN WRITING WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO EVASYST, INC. 340 S LEMON AVE #9980 WALNUT, CA 91789 AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, AND (3) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
        4. Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.
        5. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding; Selection of Arbitrator. If you or the Company elect to resolve your dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding must initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The terms of this Section 8 will govern in the event they conflict with the arbitration rules identified below.
        6. Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service provided to you by the Company concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules shall apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to, and negotiated in good faith with, the Company as described above, and if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the Company or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
        7. Location of Arbitration. You or the Company may initiate arbitration in either Orange County, California or the county in which you reside. If you initiate arbitration in the county of your residence, the Company may transfer the arbitration to Orange County, California provided that the Company agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location, as determined by the arbitrator.
        8. Severability. If any clause within this Section 8 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause of Section 8.4) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 8 and the remainder of this Section 8 will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver (Section 8.4) clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 8, except for this Section 8.8, will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and IN THAT INSTANCE, YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH WAIVE AND AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
        9. Survival. This Section 8 shall survive any termination of the Terms.
10. * **General Provisions.**
        
    * 1. * Updates to the Terms and Privacy Policy.
            * 1. Right to Update. The Company reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms and our Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Terms or Privacy Policy through the Service. You may also be given additional notice, such as an email message or messaging within the Service, of any changes. You will be deemed to have accepted such changes by continuing to use the Service. Except as otherwise stated, all amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) calendar days after they are initially posted. The Company may also revise other policies, codes or rules at any time and the new versions will be available on www.kastapp.co or in the Service. No amendment to the Terms or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of which the Company had actual notice before the date of the amendment.
                2. Seeking Consent. If the Company revises these Terms or its Privacy Policy and seeks your consent to be bound by such revised Terms or revised Privacy Policy and you do not agree to be bound by such revised Terms or revised Privacy Policy before using the Service again, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company reserves the right to terminate your Account and use of the Service.
                3. Disagreement With Terms. If at any time you do not agree to any provision of the then-current version of our Terms, the Privacy Policy or any other Company policy, rule or code of conduct relating to your use of the Service, your right to use the Service will immediately terminate, and you must immediately stop using the Service.
                4. Conflict. To the extent these Terms or the Privacy Policy conflict with any other of the Company’s terms, policies, rules, or codes of conduct, the provisions of these Terms and the Privacy Policy will prevail.
        2. Severability. If any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy is found invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality, or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which will continue to be in full force and effect.  
            
        3. Assignment. The Company may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms without the prior written consent of the Company; any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 9.3 is void.  
            
        4. Supplemental Policies. The Company may publish additional policies related to specific services such as forums, contests, or loyalty programs. Your use, if any, of such services is subject to such specific policies and these Terms.  
            
        5. Entire Agreement. These Terms, together with any supplemental policies, the Privacy Policy, and any other documents expressly incorporated by reference herein, contain the entire agreement between the Company and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent.  
            
        6. No Waiver. The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by the Company of any provision, condition or requirement of these Terms or the Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by the Company shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of the Company.  
            
        7. Notices. We may notify you via postings on www.kastapp.com and via email or any other communications means through contact information you provide to us. All notices given by you or required from you under these Terms or the Privacy Policy shall be in writing, sent by certified mail, and addressed to the address in this Section 9.7. Any notices that you provide without compliance with this Section 9.7 shall have no legal effect.

            Attn: Terms Administrator  
            
        8. Equitable Remedies. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms to the Company are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm the Company and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone, so that the Company shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Service, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the Service or any content or other material used or displayed through the Service and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages, limited by Section 7.2.  
            
        9. Force Majeure. The Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of the Company including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond the Company’s control, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.  
            
        10. Governing Law. The Terms and Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the State of California notwithstanding its conflict of laws provisions.

We accommodate and do not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their materials.  

### Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement

2. Identification of the material you claim is infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that you are requesting be removed or disabled, and information reasonably sufficient for us to locate the material.

    * (An example of such statement would be: “The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”)
        
4. Adequate information by which we can contact you, including an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which you may be contacted.

We may, at our discretion, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties (this may include sharing your contact information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication).  

### Counter Notification Procedures  

If you believe that material you posted on the Websites or Apps was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter notification with us (a “Counter Notice”) by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated above. Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter Notice must include substantially the following:  

1. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.  
    
2. * A statement containing the following:
        
    * 1. You will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if you reside outside the United States, the judicial district in which Company is located, and that you will accept service from the person (or an agent of that person) who submitted the copyright complaint at issue. (An example of such statement would be: “I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which Twitch is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.”)
        2. You swear, under penalty of perjury, by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. (An example of such statement would be: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.”).

The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten business days of receiving the copy of your Counter Notice.  

Please be aware that if you knowingly misrepresent that material or activity on the Websites or Apps was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.  

### Repeat Infringers  

We will promptly terminate any user’s access to the Websites and Apps if that user is determined by us to be a repeat infringer of copyrighted works. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, we reserve the right to immediately terminate the account of any user for any infringing activities in our sole determination and discretion.  

### Retractions  

If desired, the party originally submitting a claimed copyright infringement notice may retract such notice. We will honor such retractions where feasible, however, we may not be able to reinstate certain material. If you have received a DMCA notice, you may contact the claimant directly to request a retraction. To retract your claimed copyright infringement notice, please email [dmca@kastapp.co](mailto:dmca@kastapp.co) from the same email address as your original notification. Note that we cannot process retractions that are sent from a different email address. Your retraction must include the following:
