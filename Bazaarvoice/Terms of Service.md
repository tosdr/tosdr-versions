Disclaimer
----------

Bazaarvoice makes no representations or warranties about the information or other materials published on this site for any purpose and all information or other materials provided on this site are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. Bazaarvoice hereby disclaims all warranties with regard to the content of this site, including any warranties of Merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement. Additionally, Bazaarvoice makes no warranty that: (1) the information provided on this site is accurate or reliable; (2) this site and its content will meet your requirements; (3) this site will not experience uninterrupted service; (4) this site does not contain errors; or (5) this site is secure from third parties.

Bazaarvoice reserves the right to make changes or updates to the site at any time without notice.

Limited of Liability
--------------------

In no event is Bazaarvoice liable for any direct, special, punitive, indirect, or consequential damages or any damages whatsoever, including, but not limited to, loss of use, data, or profits, whether in an action of contract or tort (including negligence), or otherwise, arising out of your use of this site.

Some Jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability. Therefore, some of the limitations or exclusions contained above may not apply to you.

Indemnity
---------

You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Site) agree to defend (at Bazaarvoice’s request), indemnify and hold Bazaarvoice, its officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Bazaarvoice Parties”) harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your content you submit to the Site or your access to or use of the Site; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Bazaarvoice in the defense of any claim. Bazaarvoice reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Bazaarvoice.

Arbitration
-----------

You agree that all disputes between you and Bazaarvoice (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Bazaarvoice, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of this Site, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Bazaarvoice hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Bazaarvoice will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement.

You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Bazaarvoice is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Bazaarvoice or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.

You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Bazaarvoice can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Bazaarvoice in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:

**Bazaarvoice, Inc.**  
ATTN: Legal – Arbitration Opt Out  
10901 Stonelake Blvd.  
Austin, Texas 78759

You must include your name and residence address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.  
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Bazaarvoice.

Time Limitation on Claims
-------------------------

You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Bazaarvoice must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.

Governing Law & Venue
---------------------

These terms of use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Texas, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law and will specifically not be governed by the united nations conventions on contracts for the international sale of goods, if otherwise applicable. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these terms of use, or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Bazaarvoice exclusively in a state or federal court located in Travis county, Texas, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Travis county for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Bazaarvoice’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Bazaarvoice reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Bazaarvoice.

Entire Agreement
----------------

If you are using the Site on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Bazaarvoice and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Bazaarvoice. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Bazaarvoice. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Bazaarvoice will be null and void. Bazaarvoice may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
