**Passive Collection.** As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you, such as data that you submit on our website. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to ensure secure access to the Services, improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

**Third Party Technologies.** The Website and BizApps use cookies or similar technologies of third party providers to assist us with analyzing site traffic and help us determine the effectiveness of content on our site.

**Local Storage.** We and our partners use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 and Flash to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

**Combination of Data.** To assist us with our marketing efforts, the personal information of our Clients, such as email address, may be combined with Passively Collected Data. We do not supplement/append the data we collect with additional data received from third party sources.

Information We Collect from Social Media
----------------------------------------

We partner with a number of the major social media sites. If you use these sites, and have given permission for those sites to share your content with third parties, Bazaarvoice will be one of those third parties with access.

We look for social media content that may be of interest to our client brands and retailers. We do not collect content that do not meet these criteria. Where we identify such content we may “pull” the content from the social media site to store on our platform, along with a small amount of information such as social media handle, IP address and name, email address, location and age if available. We use this to develop an index of appropriate content via our Analytics Services. These Analytics Services are based on analyzing large sets of unstructured text data/images. This means that, while processing personal data is not the core point of the Analytics Services, it is likely that there is personal data in data that forms part of the Analytics Services. Where this content is suitable for our partner brands or retailers, we will contact you to obtain permission before we share or otherwise use your content or information.

Among other social media partners we work with YouTube and use their API services. Any content we source from YouTube or that is shared with YouTube must comply with the YouTube terms of service: https://www.youtube.com/t/term. YouTube content is governed by the Google Privacy Policy:  
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy

We disclose User-Generated Content, and aggregated and anonymized data to our partners for use in their products and services. For example, we provide reviews about retailers to Google for use in Google’s products and services.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government or public authority’s request.

Finally, any information in our possession or control will be disclosed in connection with any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or other business transaction in which data could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have.

We may also disclose your personal information to any third party with your prior consent.
