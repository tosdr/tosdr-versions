We have adopted technical, administrative, and physical security procedures to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and alteration. Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

To safeguard certain sensitive information (such as biometric information and government-issued identification information), we implement security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems.

In addition, the following are examples of security measures that are used to safeguard all types of Personal Information we maintain about our consumers:

* Procedures for the identification and classification of Personal Information and implementation of safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information;

[8\. Data Retention](#section-eight)
------------------------------------

**Personal Information will be retained until we have fulfilled our legal, contractual and policy obligations.** ID.me stores your Personal Information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law and contractual obligations).

Users may request that ID.me delete certain Personal Information at any time at account.ID.me or through our [Privacy Rights Center](https://account.id.me/privacy), where applicable.

ID.me aligns to the National Archives recommended guidelines for data retention when supporting government agencies. Personal Information provided by users in connection with a public sector agency as part of their verification may be retained for up to three (3) years after account closure, unless applicable regulations require a shorter retention period.

**Selfie Image and Associated Biometric Information.** Certain pieces of Personal Information, such as a selfie image and the associated Biometric Information submitted by users for certain types of verification Services, are retained in line with ID.me's obligations to our partners, with the specific retention periods determined by the first partner with whom a user first verifies their identity (e.g., IRS, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, etc.) Certain partners may require this information to be purged within twenty-four (24) hours following a successful verification, other partners may require a longer retention period, but under no circumstances will ID.me retain this information for longer than thirty-six (36) months absent a subpoena, warrant, or other legally compelling justification.

While we store your Personal Information, we use approved industry-recognized encryption methods to protect it from unauthorized access. Likewise, when we destroy your Personal Information, we use industry-recognized methods to affect such destruction.
