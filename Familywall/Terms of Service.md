All content and other material you download or obtain through the Service is accessed at your own risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your device or loss of data or content that results from download of any material. Family & Co does not represent or warrant that the Service or any feature or part thereof is available or appropriate for use in any particular location. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws in connection with your access to and use of the Service.

23. **Disclaimer of Certain Damages.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Family & Co or any supplier be liable for (a) any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages; or (b) damages for loss of profits or confidential or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, property damage, for loss of privacy, for failure to meet any duty of good faith or reasonable care or for negligence, in (a) and (b) arising out of, based on, resulting from or in any way related to these Terms, the Service, your use of the Service, Linked Services, Family & Co Content, Third Party Materials or Services, even if Family & Co or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or of damages for personal injury, so the above limitations or exclusions of damages may not apply to you.
  
25. **Limitation of Liability and Exclusive Remedy.** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Family & Co’s and its suppliers’ maximum, aggregate liability to you, and your exclusive remedy under these Terms for any and all damages, injury, property damage and losses arising from any and all claims and causes of action arising out of, based on, resulting from or in any way related to these Terms, the Service, Linked Services, Family & Co Content, Third Party Materials, Services or your use of the Service will be to recover the actual damages you incur based upon reasonable reliance on the Service up to five Euros (5.00€). The existence of multiple claims or suits under or related to these Terms, the Service, Linked Services, Family & Co Content, Third Party Materials or Service will not enlarge or extend the limitation of money damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, these actual money damages will be your sole remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain contract terms. If a court of competent jurisdiction deems the above liability cap unenforceable, it will, to that extent, not be applicable but instead the words "up to five Euros (5.00€)" will be deemed replaced by the words "up to the value of the transaction in respect of which liability has arisen." Nothing in this Section 12 will be interpreted as purporting to exclude liability which cannot under prevailing legislation be excluded, but any such statutory entitlement available to you will be deemed limited to the extent (if at all) permissible under such legislation.
  
27. **Indemnity.** You will defend, indemnify and hold Family & Co, its directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, suppliers and licensors harmless from any third party claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, relating to or arising from (a) any User Content submitted, posted, transmitted or otherwise made available under your account using the Service or a Service; (b) your use of the Service or Service and activities occurring using your account information; (c) any violation by you of the Terms; and (d) your violation of any third party rights. This indemnification will survive the termination or expiration of the Terms and your use of the Service or Service.
  
29. **Independent Remedies.** The exclusion of damages under [Section 11](#section11) is independent of your exclusive remedy in [Section 12](#section12) and it survives even if the exclusive remedy fails of its essential purpose or otherwise is deemed unenforceable. Each of these limitations of liability in Sections 11 and 12 apply without regard to whether damages arise from (a) breach of contract, (b) breach of warranty, (c) fault or tort, including negligence and misrepresentation, (d) strict liability or (e) any other cause of action, to the extent the exclusions and limitations are not prohibited by applicable law.
  
31. **Copyright Notice and Takedown Procedures.** You agree to respect the intellectual property rights of Family & Co and third parties. If you believe that material available through the Service infringes the copyright of any third party, please notify Family & Co’s copyright agent by emailing at [support@familyandco.com](mailto:support@familyandco.com) or by mail at Family & Co – 16, rue Théodore de Banville – 75017 – Paris - France. After receiving notice, Family & Co may remove or disable access to any potentially infringing material.
