PRIVACY STATEMENT
=================

Family & Co respects your privacy. Family & Co SAS, with headquarters at 16, rue Théodore de Banville, 75017, Paris, France, including its affiliates ("Family & Co") provides this Privacy Statement (the "Statement") to help you understand how Family & Co collects and uses the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (each as defined below) you submit to or which is collected by Family & Co via Family & Co’s service called FamilyWall at [www.familywall.com](https://www.familywall.com/) or through FamilyWall mobile applications (the "Service"), including any club or forum offered through the Service or that is collected when you visit the Service. "You" means an individual who accesses or uses the Service. This Statement only governs the collection, storage, use and disclosure of information collected through the Service. It does not apply to information collected by Family & Co in other ways (for example, from third parties) or through other Family & Co websites or services, and it does not modify or alter other agreements you may have, or enter later, with Family & Co.

For example, if Family & Co collects information about you from third party sources, the collection, storage, use and disclosure of that information will be governed by Family & Co’s agreement with you or the third party source, unless the privacy statement of a third party source indicates that this Statement will govern Family & Co’s use of the information that the third party source provides to Family & Co.

Also, if you provide Personal Information to Family & Co through other means, such as when you call customer service or send Personal Information related to promotions or product registrations via postal mail, this Statement does not apply to that information.

You acknowledge and agree that this Statement has the same effect as a written consent. By accessing or using the Service or providing information to Family & Co through the Service, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the content of this Statement and consent to the practices described in this Statement.

1\. Information that Family & Co Collects
-----------------------------------------

When you visit the Service, Family & Co collects certain Personal Information, as well as Non-Personal Information.

### Personal Information

In this Statement, “Personal Information” means any information about an identifiable individual, as further defined under applicable laws. Family & Co collects Personal Information when you submit it to the Service (for example when you sign up for or when you email invite other members). The Personal Information collected may include your name, birth date, address, mobile, phone, or fax number, email address, IP address, account information (such as account and online registration), online activities, and other specific personal information. In some cases, if Family & Co asks you to provide Personal Information, the provision of that information will be mandatory to participate in a particular activity, service or promotion. If you do not provide this Personal Information, your participation in that activity, service or promotion may be limited or prohibited. For example, if you choose not to provide your Personal Information in a required field when you sign-up for a club membership, you may not become a club member of Family & Co.

### Non-Personal Information

Family & Co also collects certain “Non-Personal Information,” which means data in a form that does not include direct or indirect association with an identifiable individual, such as gender, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location and time zone where an Family & Co product or service is used, and information about customer activities on the Service, to allow Family & Co to better understand customer behavior and improve Family & Co’s services, products and advertising. Family & Co collects some of this Non-Personal Information automatically when you visit the Service (Ad ID, IDFA, Google Advertising ID). If Non-Personal Information is combined with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.

### Voluntary Disclosure

Where you voluntarily disclose additional personal information without being prompted by Family & Co and Family & Co is not made aware that it should take special care in handling such information, then Family & Co will not be held liable for that information under this Privacy Statement unless and to the extent that Family & Co is obliged to use and protect such information pursuant to and in accordance with applicable law.

### Location Services

Family & Co and its partners may collect, use, transmit, process, store and share your precise location through GPS, WiFi, or wireless network triangulation for the purposes of providing our Service.

You may also be able to submit to Family & Co location data such as “Places,” and other information. Family & Co may also supplement the information it collects with information obtained from other companies. Family & Co does not share geographic location data with application providers.

You may withdraw this consent by turning off the "Locate" function in the location settings (as applicable) on your device. The "Family Map" feature is intended for your personal use only to locate the last explicit position of the family members. The location-based services are not intended or suitable for use as an emergency locator system as the location display may be imprecise or not valid anymore.
