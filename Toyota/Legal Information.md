### (4) Personal Data from Social Media

1. Facebook Insights Data
    
    When you use our TMC Facebook fan page, Facebook may collect insights data, i.e., how often you visit the TMC Facebook fan page, whether you recommend it in a post or comment, etc. Subsequently, Facebook provides anonymous statistics and insights about the usage of the TMC Facebook fan page to TMC, (such as number of followers, number of interactions with a post, etc.) to help us understand how users are engaging with our Facebook fan page.
    
    TMC's legal basis for processing insights data is our legitimate business interest to steadily improve our Facebook online content and to better respond to the interests of our users. TMC is a joint controller together with Facebook Ireland for the insights data. However, TMC and Facebook Ireland have agreed that Facebook Ireland takes primary responsibility under the GDPR for the processing of your insights data. This means that Facebook is primarily responsible for providing you with information about the joint processing of the insights data and for enabling you to exercise your rights under the GDPR regarding insights data.
    
    For more information about Facebook Page Insights Data please visit [https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information\_about\_page\_insights\_data](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data).
    
2. Other social media
    
    We may collect and/or receive Personal Data from Toyota's presence on social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram, consistent with your settings within the social media platform, regarding gender and age, occupation, location, check-ins, famous posts, escape rate, access date and time, use of messaging functions, followers and likes. We aggregate this Personal Data and divide large groups of users into sub-groups based on the same type of shared characteristics such as geography, behaviour, or demographics, in order to provide better, more personalized services for the users.
    
3. Social Media Plugins
    
    When using our Websites we allow you to share information with social media sites and to access our social media profiles through so-called plugins. Social networks are able to retrieve Personal Data through those plugins, even if you don't interact with them. Moreover, if you are logged onto a social network while visiting our Websites with social plugins imbedded in them, the network can collect and store information about such visit and link it to your social network user account. As we have no control over the data collected by social media networks through their plugins, we encourage you to read their applicable data privacy policies to learn more about them.
    
    Once you choose to share information of our Websites on social media or when you connect with our social media profiles through the plugins, those social media sites allow us to automatically access Personal Data retained by them about you consisting of content viewed by you, content liked by you and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on. You can restrict our access to your Personal Data by changing your privacy setting on the respective social media site.
    
    Lastly, you can access our Websites via a third-party service, e.g. from our profiles on social networks. In those cases, we collect Personal Data from your social media user account consisting of your first and last name, email address and phone number and any other information you have made public.
