### Captions

People with limited hearing often need captions to understand dialogue and important sounds in video and audio.

Captions are mostly prepared in advance for accuracy. However sometimes publishing information fast is considered more important than absolute accuracy, such as breaking news.

Limitations of this site’s accessibility
----------------------------------------

While we’ve done a lot to ensure this site is accessible, you may find some limitations.

* We always aim to communicate clearly and simply. This is not always possible when discussing technical subjects.
* Many ABC stories have rich media like audio and video that haven’t all been captioned, transcribed or audio described yet.
* Some of ABC’s web content has not yet been fully tested by people with diverse abilities.
* Some of the games on the ABC’s websites are acquired games. These are not games which we have created ourself. As such, some of these games may not be accessible.
