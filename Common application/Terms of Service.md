The license grant under this Agreement with respect to the Common App’s mobile app is a non-transferable license to use the Solution on any Apple-branded products that you own or control as permitted by this Agreement and the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, except that the app may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via “Family Sharing” (as defined in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions) or volume purchasing. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Solution. In the event of any failure of the Common App’s mobile app to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) of the app to you; provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or a third party relating to the Solution or your use of the Solution, including without limitation: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Solution fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation. In the event of any third-party claim that the Common App’s mobile app or your possession and use thereof infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for any investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge thereof. Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. 

**20\. Security and Compliance**

The Common App reserves the right to view, monitor, and record your activity on the Solution without notice or permission from you. The Common App’s provision of the Solution is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained herein shall restrict or reduce the Common App’s ability to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements involving your use of the Solution or information provided to or gathered by the Common App with respect to such use.

**21\. Export Controls**

You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo; or (b) listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You hereby agree that (i) you will comply with all applicable sanctions and export control laws, and (ii) you are solely responsible for ensuring that the Solution is used, disclosed, and/or accessed only in accordance with all applicable sanctions and export control laws.

**22\. Arbitration**

In the event the parties hereto are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning this Agreement or any provisions hereof, whether arising in contract, tort, or any other legal theory, then such dispute shall be resolved exclusively through final, binding, and confidential arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The exclusive site of such arbitration shall be in Arlington County, Virginia. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision, shall be determined by the arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common App may bring a claim for injunctive relief or other equitable relief against your violation of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction without being required to observe the arbitration procedures of this Section.

**23\. Class Action Waiver**

BY USING THE SOLUTION AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY WILLINGLY, EXPRESSLY, AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION BROUGHT UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SOLUTION. YOU MAY NOT BRING ANY CLAIM, SUIT, OR OTHER PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT AS THE MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OR AS PART OF ANY SIMILAR COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.

**24\. Indemnification**

To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Common App, its affiliates under common control, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any losses, costs, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of (i) your violation of this Agreement, (ii) your infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any personal or proprietary rights of a third party, (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules, or regulations, and/or (iv) your Submissions, including without limitation the quality, content, accuracy, legality, or effectiveness thereof, or any communications, transactions, or results arising therefrom. The Common App reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Company in asserting any available defenses.

**25\. Miscellaneous**

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America, without regards to its principles of conflicts of law. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the Arlington County, Virginia, United States of America, and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire Agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral Agreements between us with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by you except with the Common App’s prior written consent. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained in this Agreement is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. The parties hereto are independent contractors and nothing herein shall be construed as creating any joint venture, partnership, employment relationship, or agency relationship. You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement by you would cause irreparable injury to the Common App not readily quantifiable as money damages, such that the Common App would not have an adequate remedy at law. You therefore agree that the Common App shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any such breach of your obligations, without the necessity of posting bond or other security.

**26\. Claims of Copyright Infringement**

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (as amended, the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Common App infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Solution are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow the Common App to locate the material on the Solution; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by the Common App against you, the DMCA permits you to send the Common App a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.

Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Solution should be sent to the Common App’s registered DMCA agent using the following contact information Marc Saitta, Chief Operating Officer, 3003 Washington Blvd, Arlington, VA 22201 email: dmca@commonapp.org.

The Common App reserves the right to remove any posted submission that infringes the copyright of any person under the laws of the United States upon receipt of a notice that complies with the requirements of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3). The Common App has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of repeat infringers. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
