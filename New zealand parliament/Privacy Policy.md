**Originally published:** 12 October 2015

**Last updated:** 22 May 2019

**Organisation Privacy Statement**
----------------------------------

New Zealand Parliament may collect personal data from you when you engage with us via telephone, fax, written letter, or digital channels such as email or website forms. Details on the collection and use of your personal data via digital channels are explained in the Website Privacy Statement on this page. 

### Personal information collected by telephone

We record inbound calls made to our Parliament main line numbers, 0800 7273 6282 and 04 817 9999.

For calls to these numbers, recording starts once your call is answered by a Customer Service Representative. Any wait time prior to your call being answered is not recorded. The phone number you have called from is also stored so we can retrieve the call recording in the future. We do not use your phone number for any other purpose.

Recording automatically stops when you are transferred to anyone outside our Customer Service Team, or when the call is terminated.

Call recordings are stored securely for up to 30 days, after which they are automatically deleted.

**Website Privacy Statement**
-----------------------------

This privacy statement applies to your personal information collected on the New Zealand Parliament website [www.parliament.nz](http://www.parliament.nz/)

All submissions received by select committees either electronically, through postal services or any other channel will be published to the Parliament website.

Your submission will only be used for the item of business that it is submitted for. Once released, submissions are published to the parliament website. 

It is important that you separate your personal details from the main body of your submission, otherwise your personal details will not only be released publicly; they will also be published on the Parliament website.
