When using parliamentary content from this website, please note that none of the provisions of this general copyright statement restrict the House of Representatives’ right to investigate and address contempts of the House.

In essence, contempts of the House are actions or omissions that, in the House’s view, may make it harder for it or its members to perform their functions. This can include, for example, publishing misleading accounts of parliamentary proceedings, or obstructing a witness from giving evidence to a parliamentary select committee.

For more information on contempts of the House, please see [Parliamentary privilege in New Zealand](https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-privilege-in-new-zealand/ "Parliamentary privilege in New Zealand"), or contact us at [parlinfo@parliament.govt.nz](mailto:parlinfo@parliament.govt.nz).
