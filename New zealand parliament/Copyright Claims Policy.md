We can only license you to re-use content that we own the copyright to.

We do not own the copyright to all the material on this website. Sometimes it is owned by a third party, such as an individual or a different organisation.

### Official flags, emblems, and names

There are rules in the law about how you can use official flags, emblems, and names. For example, use of official emblems should not lead people to believe that your work is approved by the Government. Please take care when reusing content from this website. Official flags, emblems, and names are not covered by the Creative Commons licence.

### Misuse of parliamentary content

When using parliamentary content from this website, please note that none of the provisions of this general copyright statement restrict the House of Representatives’ right to investigate and address contempts of the House.

In essence, contempts of the House are actions or omissions that, in the House’s view, may make it harder for it or its members to perform their functions. This can include, for example, publishing misleading accounts of parliamentary proceedings, or obstructing a witness from giving evidence to a parliamentary select committee.

For more information on contempts of the House, please see [Parliamentary privilege in New Zealand](https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-privilege-in-new-zealand/ "Parliamentary privilege in New Zealand"), or contact us at [parlinfo@parliament.govt.nz](mailto:parlinfo@parliament.govt.nz).
