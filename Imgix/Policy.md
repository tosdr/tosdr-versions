Payment Policy
==============

Last Revised: June 20, 2023

Thank you for using imgix! imgix processes images and videos at scale in real time, caches them, and delivers them to your users. This document is our Payment Policy. Our Payment Policy governs billing, invoices, payment, and pricing of our services. This document, by reference, incorporates and is incorporated by our [Terms of Service](https://imgix.com/terms). Please read both documents carefully. _By using any Services, you agree to our Terms of Service and, by incorporation, our Payment Policy._ Defined terms used in (but not defined in) this Payment Policy, have the meanings set forth in our Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between our Payment Policy and our Terms of Services, our Payment Policy will govern.

Pricing
-------

The fees for all Services are described on our [pricing page](http://www.imgix.com/pricing). All prices are in U.S. dollars and do not include any taxes. We may modify our prices from time to time, at our sole discretion, provided that, we will endeavor to give you 30-days’ advance notice of any pricing changes via the email address you provided in your Account Information, at which point you may choose to renew, cancel, or change your subscription plan.

Billing Periods and Charges
---------------------------

We bill for the Services on a monthly basis (each a “Billing Period”) in advance – at the beginning of each Billing Period. You will be billed the then-current fees applicable to your subscription plan upon the first of each Billing Period, subject to the 30-day notice period above. You acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing recurring payments.

imgix (or its third-party payment processor) will charge the credit or debit card provided by you to imgix ("Payment Method"") for the applicable fees, on a recurring basis, at the first of each Billing Period for the Services to be provided during such Billing Period until you or imgix cancels, terminates, or suspends the Services (in accordance with the [Terms of Service](https://imgix.com/terms)).

All sales are final and no refunds will be issued even if a cancellation, termination, or suspension occurs during a Billing Period. Further, if the Payment Method provided by you to imgix or its third-party payment processor is unable to cover the applicable fees, imgix may immediately suspend your access to the Services.

You represent and warrant that you (a) have the right to have fees charged to your Payment Method, and (b) agree to have the fees charged to your Payment Method on a recurring basis.

Purchasing a paid plan when a Billing Period is in progress will incur a pro-rated charge relative to the number of days left in that period.

Exceeding Limits – Restoring Restricted Accounts
------------------------------------------------

Paid accounts that, during the Billing Period, exceed the limits applicable to your subscription plan are at risk of becoming an account that will continue to serve requests from our service's cache but will return errors for new requests that are not in cache (a "Restricted Account"). Limits reset at the beginning of each Billing Period. A Restricted Account can be restored and access the Services by:

* Waiting until the next Billing Period begins
* Upgrading to a new plan with the [appropriate limits](http://www.imgix.com/pricing)

In the Event of Termination, Suspension and Cancellation
--------------------------------------------------------

Accounts that have been terminated, suspended, and canceled will no longer be billed by our service, and will receive an error when making API requests to our service. No refunds will be issued.
