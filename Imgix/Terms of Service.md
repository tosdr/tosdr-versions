Terms of Service
================

Last Revised: June 20, 2023

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY CHECKING THE BOX TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

These Terms of Service (these **"Terms"**) between you and Zebrafish Labs, Inc. (**"imgix"**) govern your access to, use of, and participation in imgix's website, products, and services (collectively, the **"Services"**). These Terms do not change the terms or conditions of any other written agreement you may have with imgix. If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on the entity's behalf and that the entity agrees to be responsible to imgix if you violate these Terms.

For purposes of these Terms, **"imgix"** refers to imgix and imgix's investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, and assigns.

1\. PRIVACY
-----------

Please see imgix's Privacy Policy at [https://www.imgix.com/privacy](https://www.imgix.com/privacy) for information about how imgix collects, uses, and discloses information about individuals who use the Services.

2\. ACCOUNT
-----------

To access certain areas and features within the Services, you must create an account. You agree to (a) provide accurate, truthful, current, and complete information when creating an account; (b) maintain and promptly update your account information; (c) maintain the security of your account by not sharing your password with others and restricting access to your account and your computer; (d) promptly notify imgix if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Services; and (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.

3\. THE SERVICES
----------------

**Overview of Services**. The Services may include imgix’s web API, image and video processing, image and video analysis, image and video rendering, image and video caching, image and video routing, and image and video delivery. The Services described under the "API Services" paragraph, do not include image hosting or storage except for the limited caching described below. However, the Services do provide certain hosted processing and rendering services ("Hosted Services") as further described in the "Hosted Services" paragraph below.

**API Services**. The Services that imgix offers via its web API ("API Services") enable you to control the actions imgix takes with respect to your images and videos without uploading the images and videos to the Services. To use the API Services, you must connect your image or video hosting or storage location to the API Services. You are responsible for updating your site or service's code to work with the API Services. The API Services provide limited caching and rendering services that imgix uses during the course of providing the Services to you. Please know that if an image or video cached via the API Services is removed from your storage or hosting location, it may remain on imgix's caching servers for a limited time.

**Hosted Services.** imgix may make certain Hosted Services available, which may enable users to upload images, use hosted processing features and functionality, and deliver or route such images. You may use the Hosted Services only for Sandbox. Without limiting the foregoing or any other terms of these Terms, you may not use the Hosted Services to serve image traffic other than for testing purposes. Notwithstanding Section 12 (Change to the Services) below, imgix reserves the right to modify, discontinue or suspend access to the Hosted Services at any time for any reason, without notice or obligation to you.

**Content Delivery**. imgix can be accessed for content delivery of your User Content (as defined below). When you access imgix for content delivery, imgix may cache your User Content for performance reasons. When cached User Content is accessed, you will be charged only for bandwidth out of imgix. Accessing User Content that has not been cached will trigger a render on imgix, which incurs additional charges. Although imgix does not guarantee that any User Content will be cached, imgix will strive to cache your User Content for at least the lesser of (a) the amount of time you indicate you would like your User Content cached or (b) 30 days (the "Cache Period"). imgix will not charge you to render User Content during the Cache Period, even if the User Content has been removed from cache. imgix may cache User Content for longer than the Cache Period. If you do not use imgix for content delivery, then imgix will not cache your User Content, and every request to access such User Content will incur rendering charges. For purposes of the above, User Content hosted via the Hosted Services will be treated as though it has been cached by imgix.

URL. imgix will provide you with a custom domain name that you may select for your imgix User Content (as defined below). You will have the opportunity to select an alternative domain name at any time. imgix does not guarantee the availability of any domain name. imgix reserves the right to change your domain name with 14 days' advance notice to you. If you do not change your domain name before the 14-day notice period expires, imgix will select an alternative domain name for you.

4\. FEES AND PAYMENTS
---------------------

8\. METADATA AND ANALYTICS
--------------------------

imgix uses proprietary software to analyze images it processes. Whenever imgix processes an image for you, it observes, collects, and analyzes the metadata of the image. imgix may use this metadata it collects to learn more about the images it processes and help improve the Services. imgix also collects analytics data about images it caches and processes. For example, imgix may track how often images are accessed, performance data, and other such technical information. imgix reserves all rights in and to any metadata and analytics it collects in the course of providing the Services.

9\. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
-----------------------

imgix may display content from third parties through the Services or may provide information about or links to third-party products or services. Your interactions with any such third parties, and any terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such interactions, are solely between you and the applicable third parties. imgix is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such interactions or as the result of the presence of such third-party information made available through the Services.

If imgix makes changes to these Terms, imgix will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending you an email or by posting the amended Terms via the Services and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. All amended Terms will become effective immediately on the date they are posted to the Services unless imgix states otherwise in its notice regarding the amended Terms. Any amended Terms will apply prospectively to use of the Services after such changes become effective. Your continued use of the Services following the effective date of such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.

19\. MISCELLANEOUS
------------------

These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Services. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic or written agreement you may have with imgix for the Services or for any other imgix product or service or otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with imgix, the terms of that other agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement. Nothing in these Terms creates or can be construed to create an employer/employee, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and imgix. Except as otherwise expressly elsewhere in these Terms, there will be no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. imgix's failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. imgix will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any event beyond imgix's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. As used in these Terms, "including" means "including (without limitation)." You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written consent from imgix. imgix may assign or transfer any or all of its rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your consent or approval.
