### 5\. Cookies

#### What are cookies

We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

#### Cookies we use

Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

| Type of cookie | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| _Essential Cookies_ | These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services. |
| _Functionality Cookies_ | These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Site. |
| _Analytics and Performance Cookies_ | These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.<br><br>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: [https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: [www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB). |
| _Targeted and advertising cookies_ | These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.<br><br>You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) or [http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/). If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed. |
| _Social Media Cookies_ | These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook and Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this. |

#### Disabling cookies

You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.

### 6\. Pixel Tags

We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users' Personal Data.

### 7\. Anonymous Data

When we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to deidentified data and information that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual, either alone or when combined with any other information.

We may create anonymous data from the Personal Data we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect. This data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies. We make Personal Data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data for our own purposes, including the ability to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Site. We will maintain anonymous data in deidentified form and will not attempt to re-identify the information.

### 8\. Third Party Sites

Our Site may contain links to third party websites and features. This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of such third parties. These third parties have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their websites, features or policies. Please read their privacy policies before you submit any data to them. For example, we may link to social media pages through widgets on our Site or we may provide links to industry reports

### 9\. User Generated Content

You may disclose Personal Data to us when you submit user generated content to our Site, including via our Tenable Community and Tenable University. Please note that any information you post or disclose on our Site will become public information, and will be available to other users of our Site and to the general public. We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your Personal Data, or any other information, on our Site. Such Personal Data and other information will not be private or confidential once it is published on our Site.

### 10\. International Data Transfer

Your information, including Personal Data that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates and other third parties outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using our Site, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) or the United Kingdom (“**UK**”), your Personal Data may be processed outside of the EEA or the UK, and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission. In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission and the UK Information Commissioner's Office. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

#### EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework

Tenable’s U.S. affiliates (Tenable, Inc., Tenable Holdings, Inc., and Tenable Public Sector LLC) comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EU, UK, and Switzerland to the United States. We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the EU in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”), and from the UK in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/ or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program and to view our certification, please visit [www.dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov./).

Tenable is accountable for Personal Data that we receive and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. If third parties that process Personal Data on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the DPF Principles, Tenable is accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the DPF Principles, Tenable is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Tenable may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, Tenable commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Tenable has further committed to refer unresolved DPF complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, if we have not resolved your complaint, or wish to file a complaint, you can file a complaint with JAMS online [HERE](https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution) or contact:

JAMS  
Attn: Mara Satterthwaite, DPF Coordinator  
[\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  
7160 Rafael Rivera Way, Suite #400  
Las Vegas, NV 89113

The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.

If your Data Privacy Framework complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by any other redress mechanisms. See [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2)

If you have questions about our DPF certifications, please contact [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

#### Employee Personal Data under the Data Privacy Framework

Tenable commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, and to comply with the advice given by the panel with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU, UK, and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship. Please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for a copy of the applicable Tenable employee privacy policy and/or to be directed to the relevant DPA contacts for human resources-related privacy complaints.

### 11\. Security

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within our organization. Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### 12\. Retention

We will retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection (see [section 3](#data-usage), “Using Your Personal Data”). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable minimum statutory retention requirements). After the expiration of the applicable retention periods, we will delete your Personal Data. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.

### 13\. Our Policy on Children

We respect the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. Our Site is not directed to children under eighteen (18) and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from or sell or share Personal Data about children under the age of 18. You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to register, purchase or apply online for our products, services, promotions and other activities. If you are under the age of eighteen (18), please do not provide us with any type of information about yourself. Tenable is not liable for any information provided to us by a person under the age of eighteen (18).

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will delete such information from our systems as soon as reasonably practicable.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, legal purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.

#### Your Rights Relating to Customer Data

As described above, we may also process Personal Data submitted by or for a customer of our products and services. To this end, if not addressed in this Policy or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data in our role as processor/service provider on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates) who is the responsible controller of the Personal Data concerned. We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Policy. If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of a Tenable customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly. If you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Tenable customer who submitted your data to us. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

Tenable will honor your requests to opt-out of specified emails and marketing materials. Please note that opting out of marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements, or security information.

### 15\. Your California Privacy Rights

Your rights are subject to certain exceptions under the CCPA, for example, as necessary to perform or evidence a transaction or contract, comply with a legal obligation, or when a consumer's identity cannot be reasonably verified.

#### Exercising your CCPA Rights

To make a CCPA request, you can:

* Call us toll-free at 833-720-0398.
* Email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) using “CCPA Request” in the subject line.

Your request must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected personal information, and (2) describe your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity and complete your request.

You may also authorize an agent (“**Authorized Agent**”) to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.

#### Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights and we will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide you with a lesser quality of goods or services if you exercise any of your CCPA rights.

#### Other California Resident Rights

Under California law, a California resident who has provided Tenable with personal information is entitled to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information that Tenable has disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In accordance with California law, Tenable will, in response to your written request, provide you with the means to choose not to have your information disclosed.

Except as otherwise stated in this Policy (including, but not limited to, disclosing information to our third party resellers), we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. To prevent further disclosure to your personal information from use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information on our Site. If you opt-in to receive communication from a third party, your personal information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your personal information, you must contact that third party directly, as Tenable has no control over a third party's use of personal information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

California residents may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.tenable.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per individual per year and are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
