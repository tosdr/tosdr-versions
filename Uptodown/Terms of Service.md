        Note that the Apps are offered on the Platforms by their developers. UPTODOWN merely assists in generating and hosting the Apps without editing, selecting or controlling them.

2. PURCHASE TERMS OF THE SERVICES
    
    Certain Services, as indicated at all times on the Website or the Application, may be subject to remuneration by the User and must be purchased by the User (hereinafter, the “**Services for Purchase**”).
    
    Services for Purchase are offered, as applicable, on the Website or in the Application, where information regarding such Services is included.
    
    From time to time, UPTODOWN may alter the offer of Services for Purchase, either by proposing new Services for Purchase or by ceasing to provide any of the Services for Purchase available up to that time.
    
    If the User wishes to acquire Services for Purchase, the User shall simply follow the indications that appear, as appropriate, on the Website or in the Application. Any condition or term shown during the process of contracting the specific Service for Purchase shall be applicable.
    
    1. Registration
        
        To make an order for a Service for Purchase, the User shall access the Services through an Account. If the User does not have an Account, the User shall first register following section 1.3 of these Terms. During the purchasing process, the User shall provide the additional information requested, such as delivery/invoicing address and tax identification number, as per the instructions that will be provided on the Website or in the Application.
        
    2. Prices and Invoicing
        
        Prices for the Services for Purchase are displayed, as applicable, on the Website or in the Application, in the relevant currency to the transaction and include, when required, the Value Added Tax applicable to the transaction depending on the place of delivery and residence of the User.
        
        UPTODOWN reserves the right to modify the prices of the Services for Purchase at any time, but will apply the price in force at the time the order is placed by the User.
        
        Before confirming the order and finalizing the purchasing process and making the payment, the User will be informed of the full final price, including the applicable fees.
        
        UPTODOWN will confirm by sending an email to the address associated with the User’s Account, the contracting of the Services for Purchase performed.
        
        The Terms, as well as any particular conditions applicable to the Services for Purchase may be printed by the User during the contracting process. Likewise, a proof of payment in digital format will be generated and the User may consult the payments at any time in the Account through the Website.
        
    3. Payment
        
        The User may pay for the Services for Purchase with the means of payment accepted from time to time as established in the purchase process. To make the payment, the User must follow the instructions that appear on the Platforms.
        
        If the User pays by credit card, the User must provide the card details. Payment by credit card is made through a security system that encrypts your bank details when they are transmitted over the Internet. The Services for Purchase will not be activated until payment has been received or authorized by the relevant financial institution. The management of payment information will be carried out directly between the third-party platforms; no intervention or access to the users' bank data by UPTODOWN will take place.
        
    4. Right of Withdrawal
        
        The User has the right to withdraw from the contract for the Services for Purchase for fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of contracting (in case of a free period, the withdrawal period shall also start at the contracting of the Service for Purchase, even if the payment obligation is not applicable yet). In case of withdrawal, the User will be refunded for the full payment made.
        
        In order to exercise the right of withdrawal, the User must notify the decision to withdraw from the Services for Purchase through an unambiguous statement (for example, a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You can use the withdrawal form included at the end of these Terms, although its use is not mandatory.
        
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the User will only be entitled to a refund when required by law. That is, the refund as a result of canceling the Services for Purchase within fourteen (14) calendar days from the contracting will only apply to those Users who live in the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and in those countries whose regulations require it.
        
        In addition, the right of withdrawal will not be applicable, and this is expressly accepted by the User, in case the Service for Purchase has been fully provided or where the Service for Purchase implies the supply of digital content in non-material support and the User has consented such supply of the digital content. In case the Service for Purchase has been partially provided, the User shall bear the part of the Service for Purchase already provided until the right is exercised.
        
    5. Special terms applicable to Subscriptions
        
        This section 2.5 governs and applies to the purchase of any Service for Purchase consisting of a premium subscription (hereinafter, the “**Subscription**”) through the Website or the Application, in addition to the other terms in this Section 2. Through the Subscription, the User can access extra functionalities that are not available in the free version of the Services.
        
        From time to time, the Subscription may include a free trial period that allows the User to access and use the extra functionalities free of charge. At the end of the trial period, effective from the following day, the Subscription will automatically come into effect at the applicable rate, and the corresponding amount will be charged unless the Subscription is canceled by the User.
        
        By ordering the Subscription, the User authorizes UPTODOWN to charge the corresponding price through the chosen payment method. Except for free trial periods, the Subscription will not be active until the payment has been received or authorized by the relevant financial institution. From that moment, the Subscription will remain in force for the period contracted by the User.
        
        The Subscriptions will be renewed automatically, at the applicable price, successively upon expiration of their term, until the Subscription is canceled by the User.
        
        UPTODOWN may change the price of the Subscription applicable to the renewal or modify the terms for the Subscription (including its cancellation), provided that it notifies the User at least one month prior to the date of application.
        
3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
    
    The User acknowledges that the elements, functionalities, and utilities integrated into the Platforms and the Services include content and material owned by or licensed to UPTODOWN, which are protected by intellectual and/or industrial property legislation.
    
    In particular, the Services, including the Website and Application (whether past, present, or future versions), as well as all their functionalities, contents, and elements, are owned and controlled by UPTODOWN or its licensors and are protected by intellectual or industrial property rights. Specifically, all texts, graphics, user interfaces, visual interfaces, databases, photographs, logos, sounds, music, works, creations, and computer codes displayed on or available through the Services and the Platforms are protected, as well as the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, and arrangement of such elements, including, without limitation, (i) trademarks, logos, and trade names; (ii) the format of the Services and Platforms offered by UPTODOWN; and (iii) other forms of intellectual and industrial property.

Therefore, the User is obligated to refrain from engaging in any of the aforementioned actions. Additionally, it is expressly stated that any data mining of the contents of the Website or the Application is expressly forbidden.
    
    1. Use of the Services available on UPTODOWN
        
        Subject to compliance with these Terms, UPTODOWN grants the User a non-exclusive, limited, revocable, personal, and non-transferable authorization to use the Website and Application only to receive the Services, in accordance with the Terms and to the extent that the Users are entitled to receive them. Except for this authorization of use, UPTODOWN reserves all intellectual or industrial property rights in the Services, the Website, the Application, and other elements that compose them.
        
        Unless there is a separate license between the rights holder and the User (which can be provided to UPTODOWN upon request), the User agrees to utilize the Apps and other information available on the Services exclusively for their own needs and to neither directly nor indirectly engage in commercial exploitation of the products and/or services to which the User has access, or of the results obtained due to utilization of the Platforms and the Services.
        
    2. Prohibited conduct
        
        The User shall refrain from any conduct in the use of the Platforms and the Services that jeopardizes the intellectual and industrial property rights of UPTODOWN or its licensors, infringes or transgresses the honor, personal or family privacy, or image of third parties, or is illicit or damaging to morality.
        
        In particular, and without implying any limitation, the User shall abstain from engaging, via the use of the Platforms and the Services, in any destruction, alteration, disablement, or damage to the electronic data, programs, or documents belonging to UPTODOWN, its licensors, or third parties. Nor shall the User introduce or spread on the network any programs, viruses, applets, Active X controls, or any physical or electronic instrument or device that causes or is susceptible to causing any kind of alteration to the network, the system, or third-party computers. Likewise, it is expressly prohibited to engage in any type of activity or practice that violates the principles of good conduct generally accepted among Internet users.
        
    3. Content uploaded on UPTODOWN by the User
        
        The User is solely responsible for all materials or content uploaded, posted, emailed, or otherwise added by them to the Platforms or the Services (hereinafter the “User Content”). The User warrants that they hold all intellectual and/or industrial property rights to the User Content. By using the Platforms and the Services and by uploading, posting, emailing, or adding the User Content, the User grants to UPTODOWN and its associated and affiliated companies, as well as its collaborators, an irrevocable, free, and non-exclusive worldwide license, with a right to sublicense, for a duration equal to the duration of the corresponding rights, to reproduce, transform, distribute, or publicly communicate the User Content on the Platforms, the Services (current and future), and the pages of its affiliates, related firms, and/or collaborators, including in the promotion of the above. UPTODOWN may distribute the User Content to other Users or make any other future use of it via any medium and/or procedure and in any format.
        
    4. Requirement to report noncompliance
        
        Any presumed infraction of rights carried out on the Platforms or Services should be reported to UPTODOWN by sending an email that includes a description of the presumed infraction to the following URL: [https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
        
4. UPTODOWN´S LIABILITY FOR THE SERVICES
    
    EXCEPT IN CASES OF INTENTIONAL ACTION, AND THOSE IN WHICH, DUE TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE USER OR OBJECT, AN IMPERATIVE REGIME OF LIABILITY IS DEEMED APPLICABLE, UPTODOWN SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE AFFECTING THE USER DUE TO THE USE OF THE PLATFORMS OR OF ANY OF THE SERVICES.
    
    IN PARTICULAR, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UPTODOWN ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT OF THE APPS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD THROUGH THE PLATFORMS, WHICH ARE THE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR DEVELOPERS AND LICENSORS AND SUBJECT TO THE CORRESPONDING LICENSE CONDITIONS FOR SUCH APPS. THE USER ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOWNLOAD AND USE OF THE APPS, EXPRESSLY EXONERATING UPTODOWN OF ALL LIABILITY, AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT UPTODOWN, EXCEPT IN CASES IN WHICH IT IS EXPRESSLY ESTABLISHED OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO SOLELY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE APPS OF THE CORRESPONDING DEVELOPER OR LICENSOR.
    
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable regulations, UPTODOWN does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, reliability, availability, error-free operation, correctness, or morality of the data, programs, information, or opinions included on the Platforms, and, in particular, those expressed or entered in user forums or opinions. However, Users may report presumed abuses or inappropriate uses of the site through [https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.uptodown.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to allow UPTODOWN to review the corresponding content.
    
    In relation to the Applications and User Content, UPTODOWN acts exclusively as a provider of the service consisting of enabling the Platforms and the Services so that developers, licensors, and Users can store and publish the Applications or User Content for the Users. In this regard, UPTODOWN limits itself to offering an intermediary service by hosting and providing the content, while not assuming liability for said content beyond the cases expressly provided for in the aforementioned law; that is, UPTODOWN shall only accept liability when it (i) has actual knowledge that the activity or information being reported or referred to is illegal, and (ii) has not acted with diligence to remove or disable the corresponding content.
    
    The previous paragraph also applies to links to third-party sites that may be available on the Platforms or the Services. The publishing of such links does not imply any relationship, sponsorship, recommendation, or supervision by UPTODOWN of the destination page, and UPTODOWN, therefore, accepts no liability for its content except in such cases as expressly established in the applicable regulations.
    
    The Apps published on UPTODOWN are products created by their respective developers. The Website or the Application are not directly affiliated with them.
    
    Our Platforms distribute original, unaltered software, which is obtained directly from the developers’ websites or by licensors and is not modified in any way.
    
    The User assumes as their sole liability any consequences, damages, or actions that may arise from accessing, playing, using, or disseminating said Apps. It is the responsibility of the User to verify, prior to downloading, the compatibility of the Apps with their Device and other applications, as well as their features and the advantages of downloading and installing the App. Likewise, it is the responsibility of the User to ensure that the download and use of the Platforms and the Services is legal and appropriate in the User’s location and personal circumstances.
    
    UPTODOWN shall not be held liable for the infringements of any developer, programmer, licensor, or User that affect the rights of another user or of a third party, including rights related to copyright, trademarks, patents, confidential information, or any other intellectual or industrial property rights.
    
    This limited guarantee and limitation of liability mentioned in the preceding paragraphs shall neither affect nor prejudice the obligatory rights extended by applicable mandatory regulations.
    
5. TERMINATION
    
    UPTODOWN reserves the right to deny or withdraw access to the Platforms or the Services to a User if the User violates or UPTODOWN reasonably suspects that the User violates these Terms. In such cases, UPTODOWN will not incur any liability on account of the termination nor shall it be obliged to refund any amount that has been paid in advance.
    
    The User may terminate the Services and cancel the Account through the Website or the Application by following the procedure established at any time.
    
    UPTODOWN may unilaterally cease to provide any or all Users the Services or the Apps offered via the Platforms, without prejudice to any remedies it may offer for Users who have contracted the relevant Services for Purchase.
    
6. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
    
    These Terms are subject to Spanish law, and Users submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Málaga, Spain, expressly waiving any other jurisdiction that may apply to them, unless the User´s status (e.g., as a consumer) requires the application of different legislation or jurisdiction.
    
    In accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 524/2013, you are informed that the European Commission has an online dispute resolution platform available at the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
    
7. GENERAL
    
    In the event that any provision of these Terms is declared invalid or unenforceable, it will be removed or replaced. In any case, such a declaration of invalidity will not affect the validity of the other provisions contained in these Terms.
