This address should be used for any claims-related correspondence.

Should particular conditions of use exist from Uptodown Technologies S.L. (not from third parties) for certain content, services, or products offered on UPTODOWN, those conditions shall prevail over these terms of use to the extent that incompatibilities arise. The present terms of use are divided into two sections:

* I General website terms of use applicable to all of UPTODOWN and to all products and/or services offered or sold thereon.
* II Intellectual and industrial property rights of UPTODOWN content and of the contributions made by developers or users to UPTODOWN.

1. GENERAL WEBSITE TERMS OF USE APPLICABLE TO ALL OF UPTODOWN AND TO ALL PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED OR SOLD THEREON.
    1. Objective of the General Terms of Use
        
        Uptodown Technologies S.L. offers the user via UPTODOWN, or may offer in the future, the services, products, and complementary facilities as detailed below:
        
        1. **A** Access to a respository of software content classified by category. This includes the download of software from UPTODOWN’s servers with the highest assurance of availability and/or speed that this may involve. In no case does this imply the sale of a license nor possession of intellectual property rights for the program, the use of which will be subject to the license, conditions, and restrictions imposed by the developer or intellectual property rights holder.
        2. **B** Search service for software content on the UPTODOWN library and directory.
        3. **C** Direct email update service for new programs and updates.

However, users may report presumed abuses or inappropriate uses of the site to allow UPTODOWN to review the corresponding content. In relation to the content and programs available for free download, UPTODOWN limits itself to offering an intermediary service, as established in Article 17 of Law 34/2002 of 11 July on Information Society Services and E-Commerce (‘LSSI’), by providing links and search content, while not assuming liability for said content beyond the cases expressly provided for in the aforementioned law; that is, UPTODOWN shall only accept liability when it (i) has actual knowledge that the activity or information being reported or referred is illegal or harms the assets or rights of a third party covered by compensation, and (ii) has not acted with diligence to remove or disable the corresponding link. The service provider shall be understood to have actual knowledge when a competent authority has declared the data illegal or ordered its withdrawal, or access to said data has become impossible, or the existence of the damage has been declared, and the service provider is aware of the corresponding resolution.
