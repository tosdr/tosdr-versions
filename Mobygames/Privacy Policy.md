OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT

Atari, Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including [mobygames.com](http://mobygames.com/) (collectively, “Atari” or “we”) respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognize the importance of protecting all information that you may choose to share with us. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.

This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Use, of which this Privacy Policy is a part, and any other documents referred to therein) sets out the basis on which any information (which may include personal information) we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand how we will treat your information before you provide us with any information about you.

BY VISITING [atari.com](http://atari.com/), or any affiliated website, (collectively, the “WEBSITE”) OR MAKING A PURCHASE FROM US, YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND CONSENTING TO THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (INCLUDING AS UPDATED OR AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME). IF, FOR ANY REASON, YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Use.

The Information We Collect

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

Children’s Privacy

If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If we learn that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has provided us with personally identifiable information, then please contact us at to have that information deleted.

State-based Privacy Laws

As of the date of this Privacy Policy six states—California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah and Virginia—have enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws. The laws have several provisions in common, such as the right to access and delete personal information and to opt-out of the sale of personal information, among others. The following is a brief synopsis of those laws. If you are a resident of any of these states you should familiarize yourself with the law that applies to your situation, and access it in the event you have any questions not answered below.

Your California Privacy Rights

The California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA” (California Civil Code Section 1798.83) permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.mobygames.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

The CCPA provides consumers residing in California certain rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California resident, you may have the right to: (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, and disclose; (2) request deletion of your personal information; (3) opt out of sale of your personal information (if any); and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.

You or your authorized agent may make these requests by contacting us as described in “Contact Us” below. Note that we may ask you for additional information to help us verify who you are before completing your request. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you gave that person authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.

In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information, as described in the CCPA:

Identifiers (such as email addresses); Demographic information (like ages); Commercial information (including entitlements or purchase history); Internet or electronic network activity (for example, gameplay or website usage details); Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information (like voice chat); Geolocation information (such as may be derived from your IP address or included in your billing information); Other “personal information” as defined under California law (like your credit or debit card information); and Inferences drawn from any of these categories (for example, about the genres of games you may prefer to play based on your purchase history).

Your Colorado privacy rights

On July 7, 2021, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA). The CPA will go into effect on July 1, 2023. The law sets forth consumers’ data protection rights, including the right to access their personal data; the right to correct inaccuracies in their data; the right to request deletion of their data; the right to obtain a copy of their data; and the right to opt out of the processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their data or profiling.

Your Connecticut privacy rights

On May 10, 2022, Connecticut became the fifth US state to sign into law comprehensive consumer privacy legislation. Most provisions of the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) will go into effect on July 1, 2023, along with the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) on the same day.

Your Nevada privacy rights

If you are a Nevada resident you may be able to exercise additional rights to opt out of future sales of certain covered information that a website operator has collected or will collect about you. If you are a Nevada resident, you may exercise this right by submitting a request through our Personal Data Request Portal or using the Contact Us channels below. Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.

Your Utah privacy rights

On March 24, 2022, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”) was enacted making Utah the fourth State to enact comprehensive privacy legislation. The UCPA establishes consumers' rights around access, deletion, portability, and provides for the right to opt-out of targeted advertising and sale of personal data. The UCPA will become effective Dec. 21, 2023. Consumers may request to access the personal data that a controller processes about them,

delete personal data that the consumer provided to the controller, obtain a copy of the personal data, in a "portable" format, that the consumer provided to the controller, and opt out of the "sale" of personal data (defined as disclosure by a controller to a third party for monetary consideration) or processing of personal data for targeted advertising.

Your Virginia privacy rights

On March 2, 2021, Virginia’s legislature passed the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA, the Act), which goes into effect on January 1, 2023. The CDPA recognizes certain data protection rights over consumers’ personal information, including the right to access their data, correct inaccuracies in their data, request deletion of their data, receive a copy of their data, and opt out of the processing of their personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their data or profiling.

Your Other Privacy Rights

You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your information or clicking “unsubscribe” on the emails you receive.
