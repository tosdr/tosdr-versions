Communication with Individuals

We will only send marketing communications to you, as an individual, if you have consented to us doing so.

To receive marketing or promotional communications, you can opt-in by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data, or we can send you these communications based on our legitimate interests to promote our products and services where we are not obliged to obtain your consent by law. 

Communication with Businesses

We process your data within the scope of an existing business relationship with you or your company because:

* We have a contract with you (or are considering entering into a contract with you). In this case, the personal information we collect and use for marketing purposes relates to individual employees or potential employees of our clients and other companies with which we have an existing business relationship; or

6\. Do we use artificial intelligence?

Yes, we do use artificial intelligence (AI) at times. However, we do not use your personal information in any automated decision making (a decision made solely by the creation and application of  
technologies without any human intervention) or profiling (processing of personal information with a range of technologies that reduce human intervention to evaluate certain conditions about an individual) that produces a legal effect or similarly significant effect concerning you.

We use a range of technologies to analyse data. On our website we might use your search terms for recommendations of course offerings. In all cases, there is always human intervention in these processes, as we use these tools to support our expert human decision makers.

For example, when you are searching for a course as a “data analyst” we will display alternative but close course offerings like “data science” as well. The piece of processing that might use AI (for instance machine-learning, logic- or knowledge based and statistical approaches) is based on Natural Language Processing techniques to calculate similarities of words and word meanings. In any case these results are only shown to you as recommendations to make an informed decision about your application.

9\. What data security measures do we have in place?

We understand how important it is to protect your personal information. We have implemented operational procedures and adequate technical and organizational security measures to prevent any unauthorised access, alteration, deletion or transmission of this personal information.

We have put in place security measures to prevent your information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed while it is under our control.

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

Our software and systems are designed to protect your personal information from data breaches and to minimise the possibility that the information could be intercepted as it travels through the different processes in order to provide you with the Services. However, no data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or to third parties via the internet and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. By using this website and providing your personal information to us, you agree that in the event of a security breach, if required, we will be able to notify you electronically, so that you can take prompt appropriate protective steps. Additionally, we will be able to communicate with you electronically, regarding security, privacy and administrative issues connected to your use of our website. More information on how to withdraw your consent is stated under section 10 below.

10\. What are your rights regarding your personal information?

    In certain circumstances you have the right to have your personal information deleted. You may make such a request at any time and we will evaluate if your request should be granted in the event that the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. However, this right is subject to any legal obligations we may have to retain data. For situations where in accordance with the law, we determine that your request to have your personal information deleted must be granted, we will do so without undue delay.

You have the right to object to the processing of personal data based on legitimate interests of the Company or any third party based on your particular situation, provided that there are no compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that would override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
    

* Right to withdraw consent   
    You have the right to withdraw consent at any timewhere we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. Please note that even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent we may be able to continue to process your Personal Data, in some limited circumstances, to the extent required or otherwise permitted by law, or in connection with exercising and defending our legal rights or meeting our legal and regulatory obligations.

5. European Economic Area and United Kingdom 
    
    This Privacy Policy abides by the rules of the GDPR, including the rights of Data Subjects. The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/) imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The GDPR applies to us in instances where we offer goods or services to EU citizens and residents inside the EU (“Data Subjects”).
    
    The provisions of the EU GDPR have been incorporated directly into UK law as the [UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/). The UK GDPR is the UK General Data Protection Regulation which sets out the key principles, rights and obligations for most processing of personal data in the UK, except for law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
    
    This Privacy Policy is provided on behalf of each General Assembly entity, which are not joint controllers with regard to Personal Data collected under this Privacy Policy. Depending on the type of or location where training or other services are provided, different General Assembly entities may be the data controller in relation to your Personal Data. The data controller (“we”, “us”, “our”) is the Entity named when we collect your Personal Data or in the location where General Assembly referred you to this Privacy Policy (e.g., the Entity identified in the email signature containing a link to this Privacy Policy).
    
    If no Entity has been clearly identified, the data controller or data controllers may be identified in the following order or precedence:
    
    * For Personal Data that General Assembly collects on or through its websites and mobile applications, Company is the data controller.
        
    * For Personal Data that is collected in connection with our newsletters and other marketing message, the data controller will be the entity to whom the subscription form is submitted.
        
    * For Personal Data collected in connection with invitations and participation in our webinars, seminars, and other events, the data controller will be the entity which is organizing such event as identified in the invitation.
        
    * For alumni communications and activities, the data controller is the Entity that is identified in the respective communication or in the context of the activity.
        
    * For Personal Data collected in the context of a recruitment process, the data controller is the General Assembly entity identified in the job posting or otherwise seeking to source a position.
        
    * For Personal Data that General Assembly collects pursuant to a client or contractor relationship, the General Assembly entity with which you have the client or contractor relationship is the data controller. Note that General Assembly is an independent data controller with regard to Personal Data we obtain through our client relationships; General Assembly will not be a data processor for our clients.
        
    * For activities in the context of the procurement of products and services, the data controller will be the Entity identified in the enrollment form, agreement, or similar document.
        
    * If you have any doubt about the controller or controllers of your Personal Data, please contact us using the information in the section “[Contact us](https://generalassemb.ly/contact)”.
        
    
    International Transfers
    
    In order to provide the Services, we may transfer your data outside your country to countries which provide adequate level of data protection, or where the General Assembly Group has put in place appropriate safeguards to seek to preserve the privacy of your information. Those countries include the United States. In cases where we share your personal data within General Assembly Space Inc., this may involve transferring your personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the UK. The personal data is shared in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Data Transfer Agreements in place, which require all General Assembly entities to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. You can request copies at any time by contacting us at [Contact Us.](https://generalassemb.ly/contact)
    
    In some cases, the parties who we use to process personal data on our behalf are based outside the EEA and/or the UK, therefore their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of such data outside the EEA and/or the UK. Similarly, in the course of providing services to clients based outside of the EEA and/or the UK, we may be required to share matter-relevant personal data with them. Where this is the case we will only share the minimal amount of personal data ad only the personal data that is necessary for the purpose of processing and, where possible, we will share the personal data in an anonymised form.
    
    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA and/or the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 
    
    we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission (in the case of transfers out of the EEA) or the UK Government (in the case of transfers out of the UK); and/or
    
    where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission (in the case of transfers out of the EEA) and/or the UK Government (in the case of transfers out of the UK), in both cases which give personal data the same protection it has within the EEA and/or UK as applicable.
    
    Please contact us at [Contact Us](https://generalassemb.ly/contact) if you would like further information about the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA and/or the UK. 
    
6. Singapore.
    
    Where applicable, General Assembly adheres to the rules imposed by The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) as amended by the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2020 (“Amendment Act”). 
    
    If required for the provision of Services by the Company, we may only transfer personal data outside Singapore after taking appropriate steps to ensure that: (i) such transfer will comply with the PDPA obligations in respect of the transferred personal data while it remains in our possession or under our control; and (ii) the recipient outside of Singapore is bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide a standard of protection to the personal data transferred that is comparable to that under the PDPA.

For more information on the specific cookies that we use, please see the [Cookies List](https://generalassemb.ly/rolling-cookies-policy) for an overview of the cookies used on the Website, sorted per cookie type and confirming the lifespan of each cookie.

How do we use the cookies on our Website?

By default, only Strictly Necessary cookies are active. Strictly Necessary cookies allow the Website to be accessible, and without them some parts of the Website will not work. They are essential for the basic functionalities of the Website to operate.

When accessing our Website from the EU, you have the chance to customize your cookie preferences the first time you access under the [Cookie Preference Center](https://www.adecco.co.uk/cookie-policy/#:~:text=can%20access%20via-,Cookies%20Settings,-%2C%20you%20can%20manage) or at any other time via our Cookie Preference Center (see below the section “_How can you manage cookies?_”). 

We use industry standard cookies, as appropriate, to track your behaviour online and gain statistical information at an aggregated level to monitor the operation of the Website, to improve the Website based on performance and to assess the effectiveness of campaigns. 

For example, we track the number of visits to the Website, where each visitor came from (i.e. the website you visited prior to coming to the Website) and where each visitor goes to from the Website (i.e. the website you visit after leaving ours).

We and our third-party vendors and service providers, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to gather information about the pages visited through our advertising partners, both on our website as well as other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment." This information is then used by us and our third-party vendors and service providers to serve interest-based advertisements when you visit our website and other websites, and our third-party vendors and service providers will combine it with other information from your visits to other websites and apps to learn more about your interests. 

For more information about this type of interest-based advertising and about how to opt-out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks, please visit the consumer opt-out pages of the following industry organizations: the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/), and the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative](https://edaa.eu/). Without these cookies, advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and to your interests. Exercising these options will not prevent other companies from displaying personalized ads to you. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.

“Do Not Track” Signals. Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is currently no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Therefore, our website, like many others, may not respond to “do not track” signals.

We also use Google Analytics Advertising Features including Google Analytics Remarketing to advertise across websites, Demographics and Interest Reporting, and AdWords and AdSense integrations to collect data about our website traffic via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers. We do not facilitate the merging of personal information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected through any Google advertising product. Google may serve ads across other websites that you visit based upon your past visits to our website, and may also serve our advertisements on other websites. 

How can you manage cookies?

Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will block cookies, our systems will issue Strictly Necessary Cookies each time you access the Website.

In the Cookie Preference Center, which you can access via this link, you can manage your preferences to allow or refuse the storing of cookies per type (as described at section 2 above). You can withdraw your consent at any time through that same Cookie Preference Center.

Do note that if you disable certain types of cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website or use certain functionality.

Website visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ad Settings found at [https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads?hl=en).
