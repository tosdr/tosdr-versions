We understand how important it is to protect your personal information. We have implemented operational procedures and adequate technical and organizational security measures to prevent any unauthorised access, alteration, deletion or transmission of this personal information.

We have put in place security measures to prevent your information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed while it is under our control.

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

Consequently, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or to third parties via the internet and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. By using this website and providing your personal information to us, you agree that in the event of a security breach, if required, we will be able to notify you electronically, so that you can take prompt appropriate protective steps.

The¬†[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/)¬†imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The GDPR applies to us in instances where we offer goods or services to EU citizens and residents inside the EU (‚ÄúData Subjects‚Äù).
    
    The provisions of the EU GDPR have been incorporated directly into UK law as the¬†[UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/). The UK GDPR is the UK General Data Protection Regulation which sets out the key principles, rights and obligations for most processing of personal data in the UK, except for law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
    
    This Privacy Policy is provided on behalf of each General Assembly entity, which are not joint controllers with regard to Personal Data collected under this Privacy Policy. Depending on the type of or location where training or other services are provided, different General Assembly entities may be the data controller in relation to your Personal Data. The data controller (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù) is the Entity named when we collect your Personal Data or in the location where General Assembly referred you to this Privacy Policy (e.g., the Entity identified in the email signature containing a link to this Privacy Policy).
    
    If no Entity has been clearly identified, the data controller or data controllers may be identified in the following order or precedence:
    
    * For Personal Data that General Assembly collects on or through its websites and mobile applications, Company is the data controller.
        
    * For Personal Data that is collected in connection with our newsletters and other marketing message, the data controller will be the entity to whom the subscription form is submitted.
        
    * For Personal Data collected in connection with invitations and participation in our webinars, seminars, and other events, the data controller will be the entity which is organizing such event as identified in the invitation.
        
    * For alumni communications and activities, the data controller is the Entity that is identified in the respective communication or in the context of the activity.
        
    * For Personal Data collected in the context of a recruitment process, the data controller is the General Assembly entity identified in the job posting or otherwise seeking to source a position.
        
    * For Personal Data that General Assembly collects pursuant to a client or contractor relationship, the General Assembly entity with which you have the client or contractor relationship is the data controller. Note that General Assembly is an independent data controller with regard to Personal Data we obtain through our client relationships; General Assembly will not be a data processor for our clients.
        
    * For activities in the context of the procurement of products and services, the data controller will be the Entity identified in the enrollment form, agreement, or similar document.
        
    * If you have any doubt about the controller or controllers of your Personal Data, please contact us using the information in the section ‚Äú[Contact us](https://generalassemb.ly/contact)‚Äù.
        
    
    International Transfers
    
    In order to provide the Services, we may transfer your data outside your country to countries which provide adequate level of data protection, or where the General Assembly Group has put in place appropriate safeguards to seek to preserve the privacy of your information. Those countries include the United States. In cases where we share your personal data within General Assembly Space Inc., this may involve transferring your personal data outside the European Economic Area (‚ÄúEEA‚Äù) and the UK. The personal data is shared in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Data Transfer Agreements in place, which require all General Assembly entities to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. You can request copies at any time by contacting us at¬†[Contact Us.](https://generalassemb.ly/contact)
    
    In some cases, the parties who we use to process personal data on our behalf are based outside the EEA and/or the UK, therefore their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of such data outside the EEA and/or the UK. Similarly, in the course of providing services to clients based outside of the EEA and/or the UK, we may be required to share matter-relevant personal data with them. Where this is the case we will only share the minimal amount of personal data ad only the personal data that is necessary for the purpose of processing and, where possible, we will share the personal data in an anonymised form.
    
    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA and/or the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:¬†
    
    we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission (in the case of transfers out of the EEA) or the UK Government (in the case of transfers out of the UK); and/or
    
    where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission (in the case of transfers out of the EEA) and/or the UK Government (in the case of transfers out of the UK), in both cases which give personal data the same protection it has within the EEA and/or UK as applicable.
    
    Please contact us at¬†[Contact Us](https://generalassemb.ly/contact)¬†if you would like further information about the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA and/or the UK.¬†

    Where applicable, General Assembly adheres to the rules imposed by The Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (‚ÄúPDPA‚Äù) as amended by the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2020 (‚ÄúAmendment Act‚Äù).¬†
    
    If required for the provision of Services by the Company, we may only transfer personal data outside Singapore after taking appropriate steps to ensure that: (i) such transfer will comply with the PDPA obligations in respect of the transferred personal data while it remains in our possession or under our control; and (ii) the recipient outside of Singapore is bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide a standard of protection to the personal data transferred that is comparable to that under the PDPA.

When accessing our Website from the EU, you have the chance to customize your cookie preferences the first time you access under the¬†[Cookie Preference Center](https://www.adecco.co.uk/cookie-policy/#:~:text=can%20access%20via-,Cookies%20Settings,-%2C%20you%20can%20manage)¬†or at any other time via our Cookie Preference Center (see below the section ‚Äú_How can you manage cookies?_‚Äù).¬†

We and our third-party vendors and service providers, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to gather information about the pages visited through our advertising partners, both on our website as well as other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment."
