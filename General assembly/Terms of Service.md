II. The General Assembly Service
--------------------------------

The “General Assembly Service” means the website located at www.generalassemb.ly and any associated software, applications, and Internet services under General Assembly’s control, whether partial or otherwise, used in connection with providing the services provided by General Assembly.

These Courses are at the intersection of technology, design, and entrepreneurship and may be made available for free or for a fee, in General Assembly’s sole discretion. Together with our thought leaders, and seasoned practitioners (collectively “Instructors”), General Assembly offers a robust curriculum focused on entrepreneurship and practices by which design and technology can be leveraged to create industry-changing products and successful companies. The General Assembly Service will also permit the community of users of the General Assembly Service to engage in discussions and communications with one another and with the Instructors. You may sign up for a Course using the General Assembly Service. We cannot promise the availability of the Course.

If you decide to access Third-Party Websites or Third-Party Content, you do so at your own risk, and you should be aware these Terms no longer govern. You are responsible for reviewing the applicable terms and policies of any Third-Party Website or other site to which you navigate away from the General Assembly Service to use or install Third-Party Content.

IX. Copyright Policy
--------------------

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the General Assembly Service infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send General Assembly a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:  

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the General Assembly Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
3. Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow General Assembly to locate the material on the General Assembly Service;
4. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send General Assembly a counter-notice.

Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the General Assembly Service should be sent to legal@ga.co. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

A. Residents of the United States of America
--------------------------------------------

#### 1\. Dispute Resolution - Arbitration Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY CAN BRING CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO SUBMIT CLAIMS TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU ACCEPT ALL OF ITS TERMS.

##### (A) AGREEMENT TO BINDING ARBITRATION

IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONOMICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.

This agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and survives the termination of this Agreement and your relationship with General Assembly.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and General Assembly agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims (“collectively, “Claim” or “Claims”) relating to, arising from or regarding your use of the General Assembly Service, your relationship with General Assembly, or this Agreement (including previous versions), including Claims against General Assembly’s affiliates (including its parent and subsidiary companies).

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this includes, but is not limited to, claims related to payments, any city, county, state or federal wage and hour law, compensation, meal or rest breaks, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, personal injury, property damage or loss, emotional distress, any promotions or offers made by General Assembly; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by General Assembly and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or funded by insurance), and state or local statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal, state or local statutory and common law claims.If there is a dispute about the arbitrability of any claim (including about the formation, scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement), you and General Assembly agree that this threshold dispute shall be resolved by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES THAT, BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.

##### (B) PROHIBITION OF CLASS ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF

Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and General Assembly agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between General Assembly (and/or, if applicable, its affiliates (including its parent and subsidiary companies) and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“Class Action Waiver”). Further, unless both you and General Assembly otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to California Private Attorney General Act Claims, which are addressed separately below.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.

##### (C) REPRESENTATIVE PAGA WAIVER

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (1) you and General Assembly agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act ( “PAGA” ), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under PAGA, both you and General Assembly agree that any such Claim shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “Representative PAGA Waiver” ).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the parties agree that court litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

##### (D) RULES AND LOGISTICS GOVERNING ARBITRATION

In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules. You and General Assembly agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within 30 days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA.

As part of the arbitration, the parties will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:

(i) If General Assembly initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, General Assembly will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.

(ii) If a you file a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD $10,000, General Assembly will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

(iii) If you file a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages exceeds USD $10,000, General Assembly shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses, and you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the General Assembly Service was used, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.

(iv) Except as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).

(v) At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to the prevailing party, to the extent authorized by applicable law or the applicable AAA Rules.

Unless you and General Assembly agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county in which you used the General Assembly Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.

##### (E) EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION

##### 

The Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims:

* Claims for workers’ compensation, disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;
* Small claims actions that are within the scope of small claims court jurisdiction and brought on an individual basis;
* Applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights;
* Representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorney general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 19(d) is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and
* Claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA.

Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or a similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. This Agreement and Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from participating in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement and do not prevent you from receiving an award for information provided to any government agencies.

##### (F) SEVERABILITY

##### 

In addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c), in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

#### 2\. Governing Law

Except as expressly provided otherwise, these Terms and your use of the General Assembly Service will be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret these Terms and is not intended to create any substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise.

##### (A) AGREEMENT TO BINDING ARBITRATION

Except where prohibited by law, any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of, relating to, or in respect of these Terms, including their negotiation, validity, existence, breach, termination, construction or application, or the rights, duties or obligations of any party, or the rights, duties or obligations of any party derived from or associated with these Terms (a “Dispute” ), shall be referred to and determined by a single arbitrator in a final and binding arbitration administered under the rules of ADR Institute of Canada, Inc.’s Arbitration Rules, a current copy of which are available [here](https://adric.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2016_ARBITRATION_RULES_Booklet_2016_Aug2017.pdf) (the “ ADR Rules ”). In accepting these Terms of Service, you acknowledge receipt of and a reasonable opportunity to review the ADR Rules. Under the ADR Rules, there is a fee associated with filing for arbitration in respect of a Dispute; applicable filing fees will be as set out in the ADR Rules. By way of example, as of August 2020, the filing fee under the ADR Rules is $350 + taxes (for Disputes involving between $0-$10,000); and $600 + taxes (for Disputes involving between $10,000-$75,000).

If the parties have not agreed upon an arbitrator within 14 days, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, the parties shall ask the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. to appoint a single arbitrator. For greater certainty, you shall not commence or participate in a class proceeding or other aggregate action in respect of any Dispute, except and to the extent that provincial consumer protection legislation expressly preserves such an entitlement in the context of the particular Dispute.

The seat of the arbitration shall be the same as the province in which you used the General Assembly Service and the applicable arbitration legislation in the seat shall apply to the Dispute. The arbitration shall be heard in the capital of the seat, unless the parties agree otherwise. The costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally between the parties. A party to the arbitration has no right of appeal from any award of the Arbitrator, whether characterized as final, interim, interlocutory or partial.

All Disputes referred to arbitration (including the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, the law relating to the enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate, any relevant limitation periods, the law governing the procedure of the arbitration, the law relating to available remedies, set-off claims and conflict of laws rules) shall be governed by the law of the seat. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to venue in the capital of the seat, and to the jurisdiction of competent courts in the capital of the seat for all litigation that may be brought; however, it is agreed and acknowledged that the intention of the parties is to arbitrate the Dispute without recourse to the courts. The arbitration be conducted in English, except in Quebec, where the arbitration shall be conducted in either English or French at your election.

A party to this Agreement may take such steps as are permitted or required to enforce an award made by an Arbitrator. Except as required by law, and only to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, or for the purposes of obtaining professional advice, the existence of the arbitration and any element of the arbitration, including any award, shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any non-party to the arbitration. No document or other evidence or information prepared for or produced by or on behalf of any party to the arbitration shall be disclosed to any non-party to the arbitration.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, nothing in this Section prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim, application or charge with the applicable governmental or administrative agency or tribunal, including, as applicable, the applicable Ministry of Labour, human rights commission or tribunal, and labour relations board, (cumulatively, “administrative agencies”) if the terms of applicable legislation entitles you to do so and precludes exclusive pre-dispute recourse to arbitration. For the avoidance of any doubt, administrative agencies do not include provincial or federal courts.

#### 2\. Governing Law

Except as expressly provided otherwise, these Terms and your use of the General Assembly Service will be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the Province of Ontario, without regard to choice of law principles.
