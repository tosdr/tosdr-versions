Wireless Video Experience Optimization

In order to provide the best possible experience when streaming videos on your mobile wireless device, we've implemented Wireless Video Experience Optimization. Video Experience Optimization improves video streaming by encoding files to reduce their size. As a result, you can save on data usage, videos can be loaded faster and there's less risk of buffering and fewer stalls, without noticeably reducing the image quality. Please note that the level of optimization in different video files will vary based on the degree to which the videos are already optimized, and based on the display capabilities of the device you use.[Learn more](https://www.koodomobile.com/wireless-video-experience-optimization). With Video Experience Optimization in place, you can continue to access the same range of Internet content, applications and services, subject only to the general rules in our standard mobility[Service Terms](https://www.koodomobile.com/service-terms).

### 

Koodo’s Network Traffic Management Policy

Please refer to Koodo’s Network Traffic Management Policy at[koodo.com/NTMP](http://koodo.com/NTMP)for further information.

The merchant is required to read you the following text:  
“The Consumer Protection Act provides a warranty on the goods you purchase or lease: they must be usable for normal use for a reasonable length of time.”
