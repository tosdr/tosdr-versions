Terms and conditions
====================

1 Introduction
--------------

### 1.1

The Department of Health and Social Care owns the NHS website. The content, data and services on the NHS website are delivered by [NHS Digital](http://digital.nhs.uk/). You may access and use this website if you agree to be legally bound by the terms set out here. If you do not agree to be legally bound by these terms, please do not access and/or use the NHS website.

### 1.2

Terms for access to and use of the patient feedback facility under which you can review, or comment on, individual NHS services, such as GPs or hospitals, or comment on articles, are set out in sections 7 to 10 below. If you agree to be legally bound by the terms you may use the comments facility. If you do not agree to be legally bound by these terms, please do not use the facility to post comments.

### 1.3

If you choose to log in to the NHS website, you are using [your NHS account](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/). By using your NHS account you are accepting the [NHS account terms and conditions](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-legal-and-cookies/nhs-app-terms-of-use/), [NHS account privacy policy](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-legal-and-cookies/nhs-app-privacy-policy/privacy-policy/) and [NHS account cookies policy](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/nhs-app-legal-and-cookies/nhs-app-cookies-policy/). These will apply while you are using services within your NHS account.

Your use of the NHS website other than for the services available in your NHS account will continue to be covered by the NHS website terms and conditions, privacy policy and cookies policy (other than where other applicable terms or policies are notified to you).

### 1.4

The NHS website is intended for use only by people who live in England. References to "the NHS" mean "the NHS in England" unless otherwise stated. Service descriptions, entitlements and costs refer to services in England and arrangements may differ elsewhere in the UK.

### 1.5

If you use the NHS website on behalf of someone else:

(a) these terms apply to your use;

(b) you are responsible for such access and use, including being responsible for compliance with these terms; and

(c) you must, to the extent possible, make the person you are using the NHS website on behalf of aware of: (i) your access and use and any steps you take on their behalf, and (ii) these terms.

If you put someone's details in without the right to act on their behalf or their consent, you will be breaching the terms of use for this service and may be committing a criminal offence.

2 Changes to terms
------------------

### 2.1

We may make changes to the NHS website, including these terms, at any time. You will be legally bound by the updated or amended terms from the first time that you use the NHS website after we publish the changes on it.

3 Intellectual property rights and licence terms
------------------------------------------------

### 3.1

The Department of Health and Social Care own or have the right to use all intellectual property rights in the contents of the NHS website or used for the provision of the NHS website ("NHS Website Content"). This includes rights in copyright, patents, database rights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

### 3.2

You have permission to use NHS Website Content for the sole purposes described, and on the terms detailed, in these terms and conditions. You need written permission from us or any other owner of NHS Website Content before you may use these items in any other way.

### 3.3

Copyright and database rights in NHS Website Content are released free-of-charge under the current version of the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) ("OGL"), except where specified, either in these terms and conditions, elsewhere on this website or in the OGL terms. If there is any conflict between the OGL terms and these terms and conditions these terms and conditions shall take precedence.

### 3.4

This means that you can use NHS Website Content, except where specified, including copying it, adapting it, and using it for any purpose, including commercially, provided you follow these terms and conditions and the terms of the OGL.

### 3.5

The OGL terms do not apply to the following categories of NHS Website Content, and therefore these must not be used without our or the relevant owner’s prior consent, other than to the extent necessary for users to use services on the NHS website for their intended purposes:

* any logos, visuals, image rights, trademarks, trade names and design styles (except where these are integral to a document or data set) of the NHS website, or any predecessor or linked body, as well as of any partner or contributor;
* any other intellectual property rights, including but not limited to patents, design rights and trademarks;
* personal data (which will include but not be limited to images, videos and audio with identifiable people in them);
* information owned by third parties which we are not authorised to licence on to you. This includes everything itemised on our [content not covered by our standard terms and conditions page](https://www.nhs.uk/our-policies/terms-and-conditions/content-not-licensed-for-re-use/), although we cannot guarantee that this list includes all information owned by third parties. Many images on the NHS website are included as these are licensed by stock sites. If in doubt, contact us using the details below (14.4);
* any medical devices on the NHS website.

### 3.6

**(a)** If you copy and reuse NHS Website Content but do not make any changes or adaptions AND EITHER:  
  
i. include information clearly notifying users of the date when the NHS Website Content was copied from the NHS website, or  
  
ii. refresh your copy of the NHS Website Content:

* at the frequency specified on our [content not covered by our standard terms and conditions page](https://www.nhs.uk/our-policies/terms-and-conditions/content-not-licensed-for-re-use/) in the case of the subset of NHS Website Content specified; or
* at least every 7 days in respect of all other NHS Website Content;

then you must attribute us as follows: "Information from the NHS website", and "as at DDMMYY" if you are not refreshing your copy as per i. above, unless you have our written consent to an alternative attribution. The relevant attribution must be made for every separate instance, use or appearance of NHS Website Content, and in each case you must make a clear distinction between NHS Website Content and your other content.

If you are displaying NHS Website Content in a context where a functional link back to the article on the NHS website is possible, then each attribution should link to the page on the NHS website that the relevant NHS Website Content has been supplied from.

You must additionally publish, in a prominent and noticeable location within your site or service the statement that "Information from the NHS website is licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0" and, where possible, include a link to the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

**(b)** If you:  

* at the frequency specified on our [content not covered by our standard terms and conditions page](https://www.nhs.uk/our-policies/terms-and-conditions/content-not-licensed-for-re-use/) in the case of the subset of NHS Website Content specified; or
* at least every 7 days in respect of all other NHS Website Content;

you must include the standard attribution "Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0." set out in the OGL and, where possible, include a link to the publication of the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/), unless you have our written consent to an alternative attribution. You must not attribute the content to the NHS website or cite the NHS specifically as the source of the adapted, updated or non-refreshed content.

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of examples of changes to content that constitute adaptations:

* Any change to wording that serves to change its meaning or impact.
* Taking wording out of a context that is important to its meaning.
* Translation into another language.

Any adaptation of NHS Website Content or use of non-refreshed NHS Website Content may invalidate its formal clinical approval; therefore if you use any such NHS Website Content you will bear any risk associated with such adaptation or failure to refresh.

### 3.7

We recommend you refresh your copy of the NHS Website Content every 24 hours to ensure you have the most up-to-date version. In the case of the subset of NHS Website Content specified on our [content not covered by our standard terms and conditions page](https://www.nhs.uk/our-policies/terms-and-conditions/content-not-licensed-for-re-use/) as requiring an update frequency greater than once every 24 hours, that specific requirement takes precedence over this general recommendation.

### 3.8

You must not use NHS Website Content for or in association with i) any purpose; or ii) a site or service; which is illegal, derogatory or otherwise objectionable or that brings the NHS into disrepute. If you process any personal data of your customers or users in association with your use of any NHS Website Content you must do so in compliance with all applicable data protection and privacy legislation and all relevant regulatory guidance, including General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.

### 3.9

“Medical Device Legislation” means applicable legislation regulating medical devices, as amended from time to time. In Great Britain this includes Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) and Medical Devices (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. It also includes decisions, guidelines, guidance notes and codes of practice issued from time to time by courts, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and other applicable government authorities, including the [guidance on regulating medical devices in the UK (on GOV.UK)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-medical-devices-in-the-uk).

Medical devices (in the form of software applications) on the NHS website are registered and provided in accordance with the Medical Device Legislation for supply in Great Britain, with NHS Digital as the manufacturer. NHS Website medical devices are identified as a registered medical device on the software information label and through third party sites syndicating the widget.

Medical devices on the NHS website may only be used in Great Britain.

You must not copy, adapt or re-use any medical devices from the NHS website. If you attempt to do so, you may be acting as distributor under Medical Device Legislation and will be responsible for your own compliance with Medical Device Legislation.

### 3.10

If you provide any paid-for service to your customers or users access to the NHS Website Content may be included within the standard purchase and set-up costs but no specific charge may be levied on any customers or users for access to any NHS Website Content.

### 3.11

You may not directly or indirectly suggest any endorsement or approval by the NHS of your site or service, or any non-NHS entity, product or content or any views expressed within your site or service.

### 3.12

We reserve the right to alter, adapt, edit, modify or restrict the availability of NHS Website Content for use on third-party sites at any time.
