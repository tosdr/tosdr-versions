However, we will take all reasonable steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures) to protect your Personal Data.

Service Providers
-----------------

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

### Domain registration

In order to process and validate domain registrations there may be a requirement to collect additional personal information such as utility bills, passport, drivers license, etc. This is a requirement of the registry in question and that data is then forwarded to the registry by us as part of the application process. After successfull domain registration we then purge any such data from our own systems immediately. All current domain registry applications require an email address, applicant name, applicant address, country of origin, phone number as part of the registration process and this information is made widely available in the public WHOIS database. This is a contractual requirement of the governing body ICANN, but is currently being reviewed by a number of interested parties including the EU commission, registries and registrars. WHOIS privacy can be used to obfuscate that information from the public WHOIS datastore.

### Fraud prevention

In order to circumvent fraud when registering for our products, we have policies in place to validate orders. In case order needs manual checking, we might ask you for proof of ID such as copy of a passport before processing the order. Any personal information supplied to us to validate an order is deleted or redacted within 72 hours.
