2\. Terms of Service regulate the rights and commitments of both the Provider and the User.

4\. In Terms of Service, except for cases when context requires otherwise, words indicating singular include plural and vice versa. Similarly, words indicating natural person also indicate legal person.  
5\. The names of the articles of these rules are simply used for convenience and do not have any influence on interpretation by both parties.

II. General Terms and Conditions
--------------------------------

### 1\. Provider’s Rights and Responsibilities

1.1 The Provider does not guarantee that its services, personnel, or anything affiliated with Webo.hosting and/or “WEBO GROUP ltd” is completely without fault and will not cause unintentional damages.  
1.2 The Provider does not take responsibility to cover any damages caused by possible downtime of any service. Nevertheless in knowledge of any issues which caused damage with its services, the Provider reserves the right to limit any amount paid in return to the User, for any of his services, to a maximum of 1 month of the monthly service fee.  
1.3 The Provider does not take responsibility for any service maintenance or delivery delays due which were produced by third party services or other actions directly not controllable by the Provider. In cases where delivery is postponed due to external causes the customer has the right to request the next payment date to be moved accordingly.  
1.4 The Provider reserves the right to demand upgrade of any service in case when the Provider deems for it to be necessary. This is done to ensure the stability of the service and the rights to equal performance for any neighboring service user.

### 2\. User’s Rights and Responsibilities

2.1. In any case of interaction the User agrees with the Terms of Service.  
2.2. If not in compliance with Terms of Service, the User agrees not to use any of the services provided by Webo.hosting and/or “WEBO GROUP ltd”.  
2.3. No abusive act or omission may be justified by involvement of third parties. The User is always held liable for any actions carried out using resources bought or leased for temporary use.

3.2 The Provider may deny new orders and halt tasks, including support tasks that are already in progress.  
3.3 The Provider will continue communication with the User with emphasis on the non-compliance issue only.  
3.4 If the Provider’s efforts to restore compliance with Terms of Service fail because of the User’s non-cooperation or the violation is too severe, any actions, based on Terms of Service, carried out by the Provider will be considered necessary including suspension or termination of service. In case of such suspension or termination the User will have no right to demand a refund/be refunded. Moreover, the User will be held responsible for this unilateral termination of service agreement initiated by the Provider.  
3.5 In case of abuse or any similar adverse circumstances the Provider will take necessary actions to suppress the incident as soon as possible. Considering the severity of the incident the Provider may not contact the User prior to suspension. Such inaccessibility is not considered downtime. The Provider will try to cooperate toward a problem resolution as long as the User puts relative effort into mutual cooperation. However, the User has no right to demand re-activation of the service if the Provider believes that it will cause risk of another incident.  
3.6 If any illegal activities occur of which the Provider is aware of, the Provider will contact appropriate legal authorities.
