You can contact them by email at datenschutz@statista.com or by post at the address stated in the ‘Imprint’ with the note ‘for the attention of the Data Protection Officer’. 2. Process and purpose of storage When you visit our website, your computer transmits your IP address to us, and depending on the nature of your visit to our website and your computer’s settings, we save small text files on your hard drive (‘Cookies’) as part of this process. We create these files so that our website functions better for you. It is a form of short-term memory of your browser. You can switch off this short-term memory by making the appropriate adjustments within your browser. We also place text files on our system, which could contain the following information about you: type of browser and browser version, operating system used, the URL of the website which you came from, the name of your computer and the time of your visit (‘Log files’). The Log files are not assignable to a specific person by us. We do not combine this Data with Cookies or IP addresses. We do, however, reserve the right to subsequently assess this Data in individual cases if there are specific reasons that indicate unlawful use. The Log files help us to understand on which kind of computers our web pages must function and when a particularly large (or small) number of people are using our web pages. In this way, website structure, servers and database systems can be adjusted accordingly. When you create a user account with us or enter into a contract with us as a customer (e.g. by ordering goods, having a newsletter sent to you, etc.), we create a customer account for you in our system. This account contains the master data that you have provided to us, your order and, where applicable, your billing data (‘Customer data’). We store and process this Data because otherwise we cannot fulfil our contract with you. If you enter into a contract with us as a customer, we also use your Customer data in order to inform you about current campaigns and attractions that we are promoting, provided that you have not objected to the use of your Data in this way. If you send us an application, we will use all of the information provided therein in order to process your application. If you receive a rejection, your Data will be deleted six months after the rejection unless you authorise us in advance to contact you again in the future. If you are our employee, we will store your application documents, master data, billing data and your insurance data for the execution of the contract of employment, insofar as this is necessary for simpler administration and execution of the contract. This is managed with the help of the partner companies listed below. 3. Basis for the storage In most cases, the most important basis for the storage is your agreement with us, irrespective of whether you register for a newsletter on our website or if you have negotiated a contract with Statista for your employer. The following bases are possible: • Your consent in accordance with Article 6 (1) (1) (a), Article 7 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (e.g. for product information or advice by means of our newsletter) • Fulfilment of the contract, which you or your employer are parties to, or to fulfil pre-contractual obligations to you in accordance with Article 6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR • Legitimate interests of Statista in accordance with Article 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR (e.g. for the preparation, maintenance, protection and improvement of our services, for the development of new services and for our own protection and for the protection of our users, to further improve the security of our IT systems or to communicate with you) In addition, legal obligations in accordance with Article 6 (1) (1) (c) GDPR can be a basis, for example, to fulfil and comply with applicable laws, provisions or legal procedures or an enforceable official directive. 4. Location of the storage and disclosure of Data to third parties We don’t process your Data entirely by ourselves. In processing your Data, we also use programmes and services from other companies (‘Tools’). We will occasionally change the Tools we use if this seems reasonable to us on the basis of legal, technical or economic considerations. To ensure global access by our customers to our offering (if, for example, you want to access Statista while on a business trip abroad or if your company has multiple branches), we store Customer data globally. The storage locations are: • Germany • United States of America • Singapore We currently use Tools for the administration and preparation of Data (in particular Customer data, IP address, Cookies, and Log files). You can find a list of our subcontractors via the link below. If you prohibit the use of these Tools, we may not be able to fulfil existing contracts between us or may need to switch to solutions that are less convenient for you Statista uses web services by Google (e.g., Google Analytics) in such a way that the data is anonymized before being transmitted to Google. Contracts are entered into, whenever possible, with Google's Europe-based branches. Additional information about data processing using Google Analytics can be found at the following link: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ 5. Procedure and deletion periods We use the standard procedure to secure the Data, and thus create rights and roles in applications, ensure backups and upgrades are carried out in our systems if this is advisable in accordance with the state of technology. We store your Data until the completion of the task for which you provided the Data to us or until the expiry of the legal retention periods. These are derived mainly from section 257 HGB (German Commercial Code), where the storage of business documents is regulated. In the case of applications and employment contracts, we may also have a legitimate interest in the continued retention of such Data as a result of questions with respect to the execution of the application process or in relation to the issue of billing. 6. Information You have the legal right to obtain information about the Data we have stored about you at any time. If, despite our efforts to ensure data is correct and up to date, incorrection information is stored about you, we will rectify such data as quickly as possible upon your request. If processing of the Data is based on your consent, you can withdraw your consent to this processing of your Data at any time in the future. Please use our Privacy Rights form for any requests regarding your Data: https://stroeer-requests.my.onetrust.com/webform/5223f5cf-ed85-4b3d-a37c-2f49312cbd78/08f6295d-c5a7-4570-b4c4-7a2114d64c39 7. Supervisory authority If you feel that we are not fulfilling our information obligations towards you, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. the Data Protection Officer of the Federal States in Germany) at any time. 8. Voluntarily provided Data In order to conclude and execute contracts between you and us, the processing of your Data to the extent described above is necessary. Withdrawal of your consent to data processing thus only affects such Data that we do not require in order to execute the contract, rather information that you have also voluntarily provided to us. If we intend to continue to process such Data for a purpose other than the purpose for which you have provided us with the Data, we will provide you with specific information about this other purpose and the reason behind our intentions prior to processing this Data. 9. Technical and Organizational Measures You can find our "technical and organizational measures" (as used in section 32, paragraph 1, sentence 1 lit. of the general data protection regulation (GDPR)), describing how we comply with the provisions of data protection laws in the link below.

Modern Slavery Statement: Foreword This statement is published by Statista Ltd. (“Statista”) in compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015. As a global operating company, Statista recognises its responsibility to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking, or any other violation of human rights, which is why this statement outlines the measures Statista has taken to address these risks within our operations and supply chain for the financial year 2023. Our organisation and business structure Statista is a subsidiary of the Statista GmbH and part of the Ströer Group (together “Ströer”). Ströer is one of the leading German media companies and listed on the MDAX of the German stock exchange. As a leading business data platform, Statista conducts international market and consumer studies as well as surveys. Under the Statista brand, we sell accounts, reports and research support to clients across the world. Based in London, England, with about 41 employees, Statista serves a diverse clientele, including corporations, academic institutions and government agencies. Our global reach makes it imperative that we maintain high ethical standards in all facets of our business. The financials for the Statista Group (including Statista) are published by Ströer on an annual basis (https://ir.stroeer.com/) Policies and commitments As Statista is a subsidiary of Ströer, all internal and external policies of the parent company apply equally to Statista. The main policies and commitments related to modern slavery and human trafficking are: Code of Conduct The Code of Conduct forms the basis and benchmark for all the guidelines and internal regulations that ensure impeccably responsible and ethical conduct. Beyond setting out those general guidelines, the Code of Conduct explains our strong attitude towards human rights, including the prevention of modern slavery and the establishment of a fair working environment (Code of Conduct). Supplier Code of Conduct The Supplier Code of Conduct is intended for suppliers and business partners who work for, together with or on behalf of Statista. Suppliers and business partners have to respect the applicable human rights and fundamental rights of the countries in which they operate, and they have to ensure a fair working environment. In addition, they must combat violations of rights, discrimination and disadvantages as part of the legal requirements (Supplier Code of Conduct). Procurement Policy Our internal Statista Procurement Policy applies to the Statista group and covers detailed rules for dealing with suppliers, such as social responsibility and the evaluation process of new suppliers. Social Charter The Social Charter serves the purpose of representing the general social principles of Statista itself and expresses the organisation’s strong opposition to modern slavery, human trafficking or any other violation of human rights. Statista is committed to consistently upholding human and social rights and conducting its actions in alignment with internationally recognised norms, guidelines and standards, including ▪the principles enshrined in the United Nations Global Compact, ▪the International Bill of Human Rights, ▪the ILO’s fundamental conventions, ▪the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ▪the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and ▪the Diversity Charter (Social Charter). Sustainability Report Human rights-related topics are also systematically incorporated into the group’s sustainability management and addressed in the annual sustainability report (Sustainability Report). Whistleblower system Statista is also part of a group-wide whistleblowing and complaints management system. The system is open to everyone and can be used to submit anonymous, sufficiently substantiated information in various languages about unethical and unlawful behaviour by Ströer’s employees or direct or indirect suppliers. This includes matters relating to human rights and the environment. All reports are diligently investigated. The process for handling complaints is set out in, among others, the rules of procedure for whistleblowing and complaints system in accordance with the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Sustainability Report). Our supply chain During the financial year 2023, nearly all our suppliers were based in the EU or the United Kingdom, with only a small number operating from the US and China. The legal standards that are set for the actions of all employees in the Code of Conduct apply equally to direct suppliers and the entire supply chain. In detail, the Supplier Code of Conduct obligates the supplier to respect the applicable human rights and fundamental rights, such as maximum working hours or minimum wage, of the countries in which the supplier operates and to also ensure a fair working environment. Statista will terminate contracts immediately should material breaches of the above applicable laws come to its knowledge. Employees, suppliers and partners can report any violations via our internal compliance mailbox or the group’s anonymous whistleblowing hotline. Due diligence processes Supply chain due diligence refers to the obligation of companies to systematically identify, assess and minimise risks within their supply chains. Compliance with human rights, including the prevention of modern slavery, is monitored through Ströer’s annual Supply Chain Due Diligence. The most recent due diligence did not identify any human rights risks (Report on the LkSG (Supply Chain Due Diligence Act)). Statista indroduced EcoVadis IQ in 2023, a digital supplier platform through which the purchasing department can retrieve risk assessments for suppliers based on country, industry and a wide range of business-related and purchasing-related data. Suppliers with an annual purchasing volume > €100,000 were checked via the EcoVadis IQ tool. The analysis is founded on recognised frameworks such as GRI and, in addition to environmental and employee aspects, takes all human rights criteria established by the LkSG into account when assessing risks, such as child labour, forced labour or human trafficking (Sustainability Report). No further action for Statista was required following the EcoVadis IQ assessment for the financial year 2023. Risk assessment and management Statista is subject to the risk management of Ströer, which is divided into an annual strategic risk management process and a semi-annual operational risk management process. The responsibility for the comprehensive identification and reporting of significant risks to Ströer lies with the management of Statista. The risk management process is regularly reviewed regarding existing and emerging legal requirements and continuously developed, particularly in the areas of risk identification and assessment. During the reporting period for the financial year 2023, no risks of human rights violations were identified (Report on the LkSG (Supply Chain Due Diligence Act)). Key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of steps being taken We are continuously working on improving key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the actions taken. So far, we have been using reports of violations against the Modern Slavery Act received by us to assess whether the measures implemented are effective. To date, no violations have been reported or brought to our attention. Training and awareness As stated in the Code of Conduct, every employee is responsible for ensuring compliance with guidelines and laws. To raise awareness, Statista employees participate in various mandatory training courses, including sessions on our Code of Conduct and Social Charter, which cover topics such as human rights and modern slavery. Additionally, all employees must complete a whistleblowing training, which teaches them how to recognise and report suspicious behaviour, reinforcing the importance of reporting for both company success and our human rights and social responsibilities. Approval This Modern Slavery Statement will be reviewed annually to reflect our ongoing commitment to combating modern slavery and human trafficking.
