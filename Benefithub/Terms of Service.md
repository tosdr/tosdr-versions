The term “Parties” shall refer to you and us collectively.

If you are a business or other entity, or an administrator of a business or other entity, that does not maintain a separate written agreement with BenefitHub, and you are not receiving access to the Services through a direct agreement with a broker or partner affiliated with BenefitHub, then these T&Cs shall govern and control.

#### I.  Acceptance & Terms of Use

You must register for an account in order to access and take advantage of the Services. By registering for and using the Services you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these T&Cs. If you are a natural person, then you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the majority age of your state of residence, to register a BenefitHub account and use the Services. If you are a business or other entity, then your business or entity must be registered or organized in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to be eligible to register and use the Services.

By accepting these T&Cs, you are representing and warranting that you have the legal capacity to be bound, or to otherwise bind your affiliated business or entity, to the terms and conditions contained herein. If you do not agree with any of these T&Cs, do not register for, access, or otherwise use the Services. Furthermore, downloading and using the Mobile-App constitutes your agreement to be bound by the then current terms displayed in the Google or Apple app- store. We reserve the right to revise these T&Cs and any of the policies listed below from time to time. Each revised version will be published on the Website and made available through the Platform. By continuing to use our Services after any change are made, you agree to be bound by such changes. If you do not agree with any changes we make to these T&Cs, then you must rescind your consent and close your account by providing us with written notice. These T&Cs include:

    A general release by you of all claims for damages against us that may arise out of or relating to your use of the Services, interactions, or purchases with third-party Discount Providers, or stemming from your relationship or affiliation with a Sponsor.

#### II. Description of the Services

The Services are comprised of a rich collection of resources, including access to a variety of lifestyle and voluntary benefits, discounts on goods and services marketed by third-party merchants and service providers (“Discount Providers”), communications tools, personalized content, and branded programming. The Services we provide are made available to you and your Sponsor free of charge. We are able to provide the Service for free by sourcing and marketing deals from Discount Providers that provide you with commercial value. When you make a purchase from a Discount Provider, we may receive a commission or revenue share, which enables us to support and further expand the Services.

In sourcing discounts and deals from Discount Providers (each an “Offer”), we rely on the material representations made and information provided by such Discount Providers, which include, but are not limited to descriptions, content, marketing materials, pricing, availability, unique terms or conditions, eligibility criteria, disclaimers, and any other information related to an Offer that is displayed on the BH Tools. We attempt to verify and ensure that the information provided to us by Discount Providers is accurate, but do not represent or warrant that any Offer information displayed on the BH Tools is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If you believe an Offer is inaccurate or misleading upon being redirected to a Discount Provider’s website (each a “Third-Party Site”), then you should notify us in writing and provide reasonable detail of the Offer or information at issue. Offers are often provided to us by Discount Providers in the form of a unique coupon code or affiliate link to a co-branded Third-Party Site. These codes and links are reserved for use by you and other registered users of the Services and should not be posted externally or otherwise shared. Posting, disclosing, or otherwise sharing Offer links and codes outside of the BH Tools may result in the termination of your Account.

#### III. Your Account & Use of the Services

Upon registering for the Services, you will be prompted to provide the following information: (i) your personal or Sponsor affiliated e-mail address; (ii) your first and last name; (iii) your password; and (iv) certain consents and preference information (collectively, your “Account Registration Information”). You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Account Registration Information and to update such information as necessary while you continue to use the Services. Your Account Registration Information will be stored by us to establish and manage your account (“Account”), which you may use to login and use the Services. Your Account is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. We reserve the right to eliminate portions of, or make changes to, the Services at any time.

Your right to access and use the Services is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.benefithub.com/privacy-policy-global), [Cookie Policy](https://www.benefithub.com/cookie-policy-global), and all updates or additions thereto which are posted on the Website during your use of the Services. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of the Services, or any content contained in the BH Tools; any collection and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices; any derivative use of the Services or the content contained therein; any downloading, or copying, or other unauthorized use of your Account or Account Registration Information for the benefit of any third-party; or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. The Services and BH Tools, or any portion thereof, may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express prior written consent. Any right not expressly granted to you in these T&Cs, or under the polices stated herein, are reserved, and retained by us, or our suppliers, licensors, or other content providers.

Access to the Services may be interrupted from time to time due to third-party service provider failures outside of our control (such internet infrastructure failures and hosting services failures). Access may also be interrupted for periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Services. While we will make reasonable efforts to make the Services available to you, we do not make any representation, warranty, or guarantee that the Services will be available to you at all times or for any measurable up-time over a period of time.

You hereby acknowledge that neither your Sponsor or us shall be responsible for any performance, duty, or obligation represented, warranted, or otherwise owed to you as a result of any purchase you make or Offer you redeem on any Third-Party Site. You further acknowledge that we do not have any control over the products or services provided by the Discount Providers who market their Offers through the BH Tools and cannot ensure that such Discount Providers will actually perform as you expect them to based on the nature of your direct agreement with them or the content they provide for the Offer. We are not a distributor or reseller of the products or services of any Discount Provider or in relation to any Offer marketing through the BH Tools, nor are we or your Sponsor a party to any subsequent purchase agreement you may enter into directly with a Discount Provider on a Third-Party Site.

When making a purchase or redeeming an Offer on a Third-Party Site, you may be subject to the Discount Provider’s terms and conditions applicable to such purchase or Offer. You should carefully review each Discount Provider’s terms and conditions prior to you making a purchase or redeeming an Offer, including their refund, cancellation, return, or dispute resolution policies. You may also receive communications from a Discount Provider after registering on a Third-Party Site, redeeming an Offer, or purchasing their products or services. You acknowledge and agree that neither BenefitHub or your Sponsor is responsible for any transaction you choose to engage in with any Discount Provider, any communications you receive from Discount Providers, or remedying any dispute that may arise between you and a Discount Provider in relation to any purchase or Offer redemption you make on a Third-Party Site. If you are unhappy or experience issues with a purchase made on a Third-Party Site, or want to cancel or return a purchase, then you must contact the Discount Provider associated with the Offer who owns and controls the Third-Party Site and provides the products and services you purchased. If you experience difficulty contacting a Discount Provider or require assistance in doing so, please [contact us](https://benefithubsupporthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

Having read, understood, and acknowledged the above, You hereby agree that neither we nor your Sponsor, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and successors shall be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as the result of any transaction you choose to engage in with a Discount Provider, any content displayed on a Third-Party Site, or as a result of the actions or omissions of any Discount Provider or their personnel.

#### V. Direct Payments, Gift Cards, & Vouchers

When you purchase a product, gift card, or voucher (“Products”) directly from us on the BH Tools (“Order”), you agree that your Order is an offer to buy, which may be accepted or denied by us in our sole discretion, including after you have received confirmation of your Order via checkout, email, or customer support confirmation. The prices charged for the Products in each Order will be the price in effect at the time the Order is placed and will be set out in your Order confirmation email. Price changes will only apply to Orders placed after the date of such changes. We endeavor to display the most accurate pricing information available, however, we may display outdated, inaccurate, or other typographical errors relating to pricing or availability in error. As such, we reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any Orders impacted by or relating to such errors.

Some Order payments are processed by our third-party payment processing provider Checkout Ltd. (“Checkout”), and we must receive payment in full, verified by Checkout, before we will accept your Order. When issuing a payment through Checkout, your payment card information will be processed by Checkout in accordance with their then current terms and policies (“Checkout Policies”). By submitting a payment through Checkout you agree to be bound by the [Checkout Policies](https://www.checkout.com/legal/terms-and-policies) in relation to the processing of your payment for an Order, understand that we are not directly processing your payment data, and further agree to pay the price for such Order as set forth at the time your Order is placed, together with any associated shipping, handling, or processing fees, and applicable taxes.

The balance or commercial value associated with each such EProduct is maintained and handled by the Issuer and not BenefitHub. You are responsible for reading the full description and terms of sale associated with each EProduct. Once purchased, the EProduct will be delivered to you, or the indicated recipient indicated by you at the time of purchase, by the Issuer via email or other means indicated by the Issuer at the point of sale. Delivery may be delayed if the Issuer or Checkout requires additional time to verify your transaction based on the information you provided, or otherwise identifies your transaction as a fraud risk. We reserve the right to delay or decline purchases of EProducts for any reason or to limit the commercial value or number of EProducts you are able to buy through the BH Tools. We do not offer any refunds, returns, or cancellations on any EProducts. To seek a refund, return, or cancellation of an EProduct, you, or the recipient, must contact the Issuer and the EProduct must remain unused. If a dispute arises between you and an Issuer, you agree to release us (and our affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and agents) from any and all claims arising out of or relating to such dispute.

#### VII. BenefitHub Cash Back Points

When you engage with certain Offers or purchase certain EProducts (including clicking on third party links or using available coupon codes), you may earn rewards points with an assigned monetary value (“Cash Back Rewards”). Cash Back Rewards are awarded after the completion of certain actions through the Services, such as making a purchase or completing a transaction on an eligible Third-Party Site. The availability of Cash Back Rewards for each Offer will be clearly indicated on the BH Tools. Once you accumulate the equivalent of at least $5.00 in Cash Back Rewards, as indicated by the balance displayed on your Account on (the “Balance”), you may redeem your Cash Back Rewards for a gift card on the Website or direct PayPal transfer payable to you in United States Dollars in an amount equivalent to your Balance. You will be required to provide additional information necessary to verify and link your PayPal account, if you elect to redeem your Balance via PayPal transfer. If you elect to exchange your Balance for gift cards, the types of gift cards may vary based on your location, specifically where the Services are being provided outside of the United States, or where an Issuer does not offer products for a particular region or market. You acknowledge and understand that gift cards are subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations placed on such gift cards by the Issuer providing them and all such gift cards will be subject to each Issuer’s own terms of service.

Our ability to provide Cash Back Rewards to you is interdependent on the occurrence of a completed purchase or successful referral occurring with a participating Discount Provider. As such, we only provide Cash Back Rewards to you after you successfully complete a purchase or action on an eligible Offer, product, or service and the Discount Provider managing such Offer, product, or service receives payment. If a Discount Provider does not receive payment, you refund payment, or we do not receive payment from the participating Discount Provider for the particular action or transaction, then we reserve the right to withhold allocation of any Cash Back Rewards related to that transaction. This includes instances where there are difficulties in tracking a transaction due to your use of an ad-blocker, disabling of tracking cookies, or interaction with another affiliate program. Where there is a discrepancy related to your eligibility to receive Cash Back Rewards in relation to a transaction, we may require you to provide copies of your order confirmation, order number, or other proof of purchase. You must have an active Account to be eligible to earn Cash Back Rewards.

Your Balance may expire under the following circumstances: (1) you fail to login to your Account for a continuous period of three calendar years rendering your Account inactive; or (2) three calendar years after the expiration or termination of your Account or your Sponsor’s agreement with BenefitHub (your “Balance Expiration Date”). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, if you fail to claim your Balance by your Balance Expiration Date, then you will forfeit your remaining Balance and release all claims related thereto. Furthermore, you agree that any disputes relating to your eligibility to receive Cash Back Rewards or the expiration of your Balance will be resolved by us in our sole discretion, and you agree to abide by our resolution.

To prevent instances of abuse or fraud, your account may become ineligible to participate in the Cash Back Rewards program if tracking your transactions becomes an issue or multiple discrepancies related to your eligibility arise. We reserve the right to withhold awarding or paying any Cash Back Reward sum that we believe is attributable to fraudulent transactions, illegal activity, or any other intentional misconduct or abuse of the Cash Back Rewards program, or due to any error, bug, or defect with the Services. For all questions relating to the Cash Back Rewards program please visit our [support center.](https://benefithubsupporthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001789894-Cash-Back.)

##### D.  Limitation of Liability

Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you expressly agree to limit our total liability to you and any third party in connection with any claim arising out of or relating to your use of the Services or BH Tools, or relating to our Communications, to the actual amount of direct damages suffered, but no more than five hundred ($500) U.S. dollars per claim. You further agree not to hold us liable or responsible for any damages or losses, including, but not limited to, all special, consequential, indirect, intangible, reputational, loss of money, or loss of goodwill, whether resulting directly or indirectly, from:

* Your use of, or inability to use, the Services or BH Tools, including any delays, downtown, or interruptions in service (whether resulting from us directly or any of our service providers);
* Viruses or other malicious software or code introduced or obtained by using the BH Tools, a Third-Party Site, or interacting with any other website or service linked to or from the BH Tools;
* Any content, graphics, or information displayed on the BH Tools or a Third-Party Site, including inaccuracies, errors, or omissions contained therein;
* Any action taken against your Account, including, but not limited to restrictions or limitations on access, reduced features or functionality, and suspension or termination.

##### E.  Agreement to Arbitrate

 You expressly agree not to bring any action or claim as a plaintiff of a representative class or class member in any proceeding or representative action against us. By accepting these T&Cs you expressly agree that any and all claims or disputes that arise between the Parties, including, without limitation, any claims based on consumer rights, federal or state statute, contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, common law, or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively binding arbitration, except for claims that qualify for small claims court, and provided that any such matter remains in small claims court and advances on an individual, and non-class or representative, basis.

Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the arbitral proceedings shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with its then current rules and procedures, except as modified by this Section(X)(E). In the event that the AAA is unable to administer the arbitral proceedings, the Parties will mutually select another administrator or rely on a court’s selection. The cost of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be split equally between the Parties, unless the total relief sought is $10,000 or less, in which case we will pay all filing administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. You must submit a request for our payment of fees along with any demand you make. If the arbitrator determines that the claim(s) you assert are frivolous, then you agree to reimburse us for all fees we paid in association with the arbitral proceedings that you would otherwise have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.

The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English and be held in the county in which you reside or at another location mutually agreed to by the Parties. The proceedings will be administered by one arbitrator mutually agreed to by the Parties or otherwise appointed under the AAA rules. If the total value of relief you are seeking is $10,000 or less, then either Party may elect to have the proceedings conducted entirely by telephone, teleconference, through written submission, or any combination thereof, the election of which shall be binding on the Parties, but subject to the arbitrator(s) discretional request to hold an in-person hearing. Where appearing in- person is unduly burdensome or potentially harmful, the Parties agree that such appearance may be satisfied through an appearance via video conference. Any discussions relating to settlement, including settlement offers, shall not be disclosed by the Parties to the arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the substance of each claim in accordance with applicable law, these T&Cs, and ex aequo et bono (from principals of equity and conscience). The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties, and judgment on the award may be entered into any court having proper jurisdiction.

If you desire to opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate, then you must mail us a written opt-out notice no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these T&Cs. You must mail the opt-out notice to BenefitHub, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 4030 W. Boy Scout Blvd., Suite 400, Tampa, FL 33607.

Your notice must also contain your handwritten signature and date for it to be effective. This opt-out shall only apply to this Section (X)(E) and not any other portion of these T&Cs.

All such amendments and updates shall only apply to claims filed after the effective publication date thereof. We will notify you of these changes by publishing the updated or amended terms on our Website and by providing notice via email where possible. If you do not agree to any of the amended terms, then you may opt-out or terminate your Account within thirty (30) days of the publication date.

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from all claims, damages, or expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney´s fees and other legal expenses, made or incurred by any third party due to or arising in whole or in part out of your breach of these T&Cs, your use of the Services (including any purchases you make through or using the BH Tools), your violation of any applicable law, regulation, or the rights of a third party when using the Services, and the actions or inaction of any third party to whom you grant access to use your Account or permit to access the BH Tools through your Account.
