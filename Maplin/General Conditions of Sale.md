We’re unable to accept returns for games, digital storage (E.g. SSD, HDD, SD), downloads or subscriptions once activated, opened or used, as we're unable to verify the authenticity of the return.

**Contracted services**

We're unable to refund contracted services such as installation where the service has been completed

**After 30 Days of Receiving Your Goods**

We don't accept returns for unwanted items after the above returns period.

If your item develops a fault after 30 days of receiving it, you may be entitled to a repair depending on the age of the item.

It is vital that you have your order receipt and serial number (if applicable) when contacting us to report a faulty item.

**  
Returns Methods**

Once approved by the team, we'll issue you with a returns label or QR code. Depending on the returns label provided, you may be able to:

* Drop off the return parcel at your local, [**UPS Drop Off Point**](https://www.ups.com/dropoff?loc=en_GB), or [**Royal Mail Post Office**](https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you).
* Or we may be able to organise a collection from your home.

Some items require special handling and can only be collected.

All returns must be sent back using the return label issued by the team unless stated otherwise by a customer service agent through the verified communications channels (email, social). Returns will be rejected if the issued return label is defaced, edited, amended in any way or form.

Returns are required to be sent back within 14 days of approval or your return may be rejected.

  

**Refunds**  
  
Once the item has been returned, assessed and verified, we'll process your refund. Refunds are typically processed within 2-5 working days from the date your return was delivered to us. In the event that there are any delays to this, you will be notified, in which case your return will be resolved within 14 days from the date delivered to us.

Refunds may take up to 10 days for the funds to appear in your account. Please note that if you return products that do not meet, or are outside our returns policy, we're unable to process a full refund.

Refunds are issued excluding the original delivery charge.

Once a returned item has been processed by our Returns Team, we can't send it back to you.

  

**Exchange and Repair Returns**

Once the item has been returned, assessed and verified, we'll process your repair or exchange.

If we are unable to offer a repair or exchange, we may offer a refund of the full or partial amount depending on the age of the product.

We reserve the right to reduce the amount of refund or return the item to you if the item or the packaging has been handled excessively, the condition does not meet our quality requirements (I.e. damaged packaging, cosmetic defects) or is incomplete (not as sold, missing parts or accessories). In this instance, you will be liable for carriage, and handling costs.
