We would like to specifically draw your attention to the fact that we share certain personal information with third parties who help us to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. The information we share with those third parties includes some of the information that you share with us (such as, your contact details and information about the transaction), and some of the information from your online interactions (such as the IP address of your device).

If you no longer wish to be a customer, you can also contact our support team and request to delete all the information we have on you.

In some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to or the law says we have to.

Alternatively email our support team atÂ [help@maplin.co.uk](mailto:help@maplin.co.uk)Â and we'll update your preferences.

Please bare in mind that Maplin has many inter-connecting services so it may take a few days for our systems to update. Also stopping marketing messages will not stop order related updates.

* Update incorrect data we have on file
* Request to delete your information on file
