Do you give a damn about the future of this country?

The guardrails protecting democracy may have buckled, but they are not broken. Autocratic forces are ascendant in America—yes, it _can_ happen here, and did—but the story isn’t fully written. **Truth-telling independent media is one remaining bulwark against Trump’s unrestrained exercise of power.** He rails against the press as the “enemy of the people,” because like all liars and extremists, he hates the scrutiny that comes from fearless investigative reporting. Our nonprofit newsroom is built for the chaos and uncertainty ahead. **Depend on it, and please stand with us.**
