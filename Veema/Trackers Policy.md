Cookies are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer when you visit websites. Like many other organisations, we use them because they make the experience better for you as a visitor.

We use different types of cookies so you:
-----------------------------------------

* Can sign in to your account if you have created one with us faster and more easily. This sort of cookie usually gets deleted when you log out but may be left so the site remembers your preferences when you sign in.
* Don’t have to log in every time you visit a new page on our site. These cookies are also usually deleted when you log out so you can’t access features or particular areas of the site unless you’re logged in.
* Don’t need to re-enter information on forms because it is remembered for you.
* Don’t have to re-enter your preferences every time you visit, which means the site stays as you want it.

Third-Party Cookies
-------------------

* There are also a few cookies on the site from other organisations that we use to improve how the site works. Google Analytics’ cookies, for instance, mean we can see how long people stay on the site and which are our most popular pages.There are also cookies from Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites cookies. These let you connect to those social media sites through share buttons when browsing our site. If you don’t want this to happen, just make sure you are logged out of your social media account when you visit us site or change your browser settings to stop this in the first place.
    
    You can change your browser settings to stop any cookies being stored on your computer, but if you do so you might find that many sites you visit won’t work as well as they should. For that reason, we suggest you don’t disable cookies unless there is a very good reason to do so.
