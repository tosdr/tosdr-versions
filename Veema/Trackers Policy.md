* Can sign in to your account if you have created one with us faster and more easily. This sort of cookie usually gets deleted when you log out but may be left so the site remembers your preferences when you sign in.
* Don’t have to log in every time you visit a new page on our site. These cookies are also usually deleted when you log out so you can’t access features or particular areas of the site unless you’re logged in.
* Don’t need to re-enter information on forms because it is remembered for you.
* Don’t have to re-enter your preferences every time you visit, which means the site stays as you want it.
