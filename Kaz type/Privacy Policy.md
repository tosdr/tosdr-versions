Unless otherwise stated, data is normally shared and processed as anonymised data. However, there may be situations, such as an investigation or complaint, when Open Awards is required to process or share individual personal details due to a legitimate business reason.

Upon achievement of Qualifications and/or Qualification units, Open Awards are required to pass the achievement details of learners to The Learning Records Service, which will update learners’ Personal Learning Records (PLR). This is done through a secure link between Open Awards and LRS databases. The PLR is a source of information to support learners in their decision-making in relation to further study, employment, or skills development. We only send achievement data to the PLR, where a learner has a valid ULN.
