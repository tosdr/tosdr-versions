Payment Methods

We accept credit and debit card payments, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal. We only charge for an item once it is bought through our online shop. You are also welcome to place orders by telephone, post or email. We never auto-renew for home use purchases.

All credit card payments are processed by Secure Trading using their secure web pages, which use 128-bit encryption. We do not store any credit card information.

Currencies

All purchases through the KAZ shop will be charged to your card in the currency stated. The amount appearing on your card statement will depend upon the exchange rate at the time of purchase and transaction charges. If your local currency differs from that shown, our system will automatically default to the KAZ USA shop, and you will be charged in US dollars. Your card issuer will convert the US dollar price into your currency.

Tax Charges

Orders placed within the UK or the European Union are subject to value-added tax (VAT) at 20%. The prices shown within the KAZ UK store for home use include VAT. All business products are displayed nett of VAT with VAT added at the checkout.

All software remains the property of KAZ Type Limited until paid in full, per the payment terms stated on your invoice.

KAZ CDROM Versions

KAZ has discontinued all CDROM versions to reduce our carbon footprint and its environmental impact.

\*Our tests and surveys have shown that the majority of users complete the A-Z keys section in 90 minutes. However, this is not guaranteed and some individuals may take longer. KAZ is structured so that the individual can work at their own pace. Allow an average of 4 hours plus practise time to complete the entire course covering the rest of the keyboard.
