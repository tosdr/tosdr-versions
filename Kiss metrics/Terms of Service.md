### 2\. Fees

#### 2.1 SUBSCRIPTION TERMS

Kissmetrics offers a range of subscription plans to its Services (each, a “Plan”). Each Plan includes a numerical range of user interactions or engagement views (“Events”) and custom messages (“Messages”) that may be recorded by our Services on your registered web page, along with custom email communications sent (“Emails”) in any given month of the subscription period.

You will select your Plan as part of your registration for the Services, which may begin with a Free Trial (as defined in Section 2.3 (“Free Trial”) herein). Each subscription period for a Plan will be based on the subscription period chosen/sold (e.g. annually, bi-annually, quarterly, monthly). You may choose to be billed for the Plan annually or in less than annual increments (e.g. monthly or bi-annually), but regardless of your billing cycle, you are responsible for subscription fees for the entire subscription period chosen/sold.

At the end of your current subscription period, your Plan will automatically renew for a subscription period equal to your prior subscription period unless you provide Kissmetrics with email notice (sent to [billing@kissmetrics.io](mailto:billing@kissmetrics.io)) of your intent not to renew your Plan at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current subscription period.

To view the specific details of your Plan, including pricing information and the end date of your subscription period, login to your account on Kissmetrics and click the [“Account”](https://app.kissmetrics.io/account) page or contact us at [billing@kissmetrics.io](mailto:billing@kissmetrics.io).

#### 2.2 BILLING POLICIES, REFUNDS, OVERAGES, AND UPGRADE AND DOWNGRADE TERMS

* The fees for your Plan are billed in advance of each billing cycle.
* In the event you cancel your Plan, no refunds or credits will be provided for partial or unused months of the Services.
* If you exceed your Plan’s Event, Tracked User and/or Email limits in any given month, you will be either (a) charged overages for the month based on your current plan’s monthly cost or (b) automatically upgraded to the next level Plan for the remainder of your subscription period. We will always choose the less expensive option for you.
* If you upgrade your Plan level, you will immediately be charged for the increased price of the upgraded Plan, pro-rated to reflect the remaining duration of your subscription period, and you will be charged the full amount of the then-current rate for the new Plan, beginning with your next billing cycle.
* If you desire to downgrade your Plan level prior to the end of your subscription period, please provide written notice to [billing@kissmetrics.io](mailto:billing@kissmetrics.io). The Plan downgrade will take effect the first billing cycle that occurs more than thirty (30) days following your notice to Kissmetrics, and you will not receive any refunds for payments made on your current billing cycle. Downgrading your Plan may cause the loss of account content, features, or capacity. Kissmetrics disclaims liability for any such loss.
* Any discounts applied to a previous subscription may not apply to a renewed subscription, including to any automatic renewals.
* Any questions involving upgrades or downgrades to your Plan can be directed to [billing@kissmetrics.io](mailto:billing@kissmetrics.io).

#### 13.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This Agreement (including any amendment thereto), together with the Privacy Policy, represents the complete agreement between us concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties.

#### 13.4 AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

Certain portions of this Section 13.4 are deemed to be a “written agreement for arbitration” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Kissmetrics agree that we intend that this Section 13.4 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.

If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, the Website, your Plan, or this Agreement, including but not limited to claims for indemnification, contribution, or cross-claims in a pending action involving one or more third parties (collectively, a “Dispute”), then either you or Kissmetrics may elect to submit the Dispute to be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in Delaware; but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, Kissmetrics shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. You and Kissmetrics will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Kissmetrics to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 13.4 to be enforceable, then Kissmetrics will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.

In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (a) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (b) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (c) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.

#### 13.5 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The foregoing provisions of this Section 13.4 will not apply to any (a) legal action taken by you or Kissmetrics to seek an injunction or other equitable relief or (b) controversy, allegation or claim that arises out of relates to your or Kissmetrics’ actual or alleged intellectual property rights.

#### 13.6 CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of Delaware without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and Delaware law, rules, and regulations, Delaware law, rules and regulations shall prevail and govern. Except to the extent that arbitration is elected in accordance with Section 13.4 above, any action or proceeding relating to a Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Delaware. Accordingly, each party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Delaware. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement.
