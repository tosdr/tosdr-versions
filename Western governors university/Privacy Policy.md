### How We Use Your Data

Broadly speaking, we use your information to contact you regarding programs you indicated you are interested in and, when you are ready, enroll you in those WGU programs. We may use your information to communicate with you about our educational offerings and send you updates as they become available. We also use the information we collect to administer our academic programs, conduct university business, provide services to our students, and make other products and services available. Occasionally, we may also use your information to notify you about changes to our Website or new educational programs we think you will find valuable. We also use data collected via cookies to optimize our products and services, including our Website.

Specifically, we use your information to:

* Provide educational services, like those required to evaluate your application for admission, process your enrollment and payments for our programs, or determine your eligibility for financial aid, scholarships, grants, and other types of funding.  
* Communicate with you by phone, text, and email regarding your interest in our programs and services, including sending marketing messages.

* To comply with any court order, law, regulation, or legal process, including responding to any government or regulatory request.  
* For any purpose disclosed by us when you provide your information.  

We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for such disclosure if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions, to protect our operations or users, or in anticipation of or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.

We will not sell or otherwise share Personal Data with third parties or nonaffiliated companies except for those purposes described above or as required or permitted by law. However, we may freely share any data collected through the Website that is not Personal Data. We may use and disclose aggregated and de-identified information about our users without restriction.  

### How WGU Protects Your Data

Using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, WGU implements measures designed to secure your information under our control from accidental loss, unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of your data will not occur, we use appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent this. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. If you use a password to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for creating a strong password and for keeping the password confidential.

### Your Privacy Rights At WGU

We believe you should know what data we have about you and how you can access it without being treated in a discriminatory way or receiving a lesser degree of service from WGU. For certain types of data, you can use [this form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/f6416a60-3927-4eb2-af84-637e45e52bfe/86ea1660-da11-415c-8ab3-4e810d621bdd) to find out what information we have about you. You can also use the webform to request that we update incorrect information, delete your information, get a copy of your information, or appeal a decision we made regarding any of these requests. Please note that when we delete your information, we may retain cached or archived copies for a certain period of time.

In some circumstances we may not grant your request, including but not limited to when:

* Granting your request would violate WGU’s legal obligations, including compliance with applicable law.
* Granting your request would compromise the integrity of its admissions process.
* Granting your request would compromise our security measures or pose a risk to our intellectual property.
* Granting your request would jeopardize others’ privacy, be frivolous, or be exceptionally impractical.  
* We cannot verify your identity.

If you make a request on someone else's behalf, you will still fill out [this form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/f6416a60-3927-4eb2-af84-637e45e52bfe/86ea1660-da11-415c-8ab3-4e810d621bdd) but may need to provide additional information to authenticate the request. Please note that before we can act on any request, we must verify the authenticity and identity of the requester.

**FERPA**: WGU complies with the protections established under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). For more information about FERPA and how it applies, please refer to the FERPA Section below.

### Retention

To support a lifelong educational journey, we typically retain your information unless otherwise required by applicable law or you submit a request to delete your Personal Data [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/f6416a60-3927-4eb2-af84-637e45e52bfe/86ea1660-da11-415c-8ab3-4e810d621bdd).

### Call Recording

All calls with WGU and its affiliates may be recorded for quality and training purposes.

* As a prospective student, you may opt out of outbound call recording at any time by,
    * updating your preferences in the enrollment portal upon completion of an admissions application or
    * emailing [enrollment@wgu.edu](mailto:enrollment@wgu.edu).
* As a WGU student, you may opt out of outbound call recording at any time by updating your call recording preference through the _Security_ tab in the [www.my.wgu.edu](http://www.my.wgu.edu/).

**Note**: It may take WGU and its affiliates up to three business days to implement an opt-out request.

### Automated Decisions

We do not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review.

### FERPA

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects a student’s education records at institutions that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA governs the access and release of your educational records.

**Scope of FERPA:** FERPA protections take effect on a student’s first day of classes at a qualifying institution, like WGU. It does not apply to persons who were denied acceptance or decline their invitation to attend WGU.

**How it Works:** To find out more about our practices under FERPA, please review our FERPA policy in the [WGU Student Handbook](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Family-Educational-Rights-and-Privacy-Act-FERPA/ta-p/139).
