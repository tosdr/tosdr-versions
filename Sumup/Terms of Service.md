22\. Disputes and Governing Law

22.1. Any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and SumUp relating to these Terms or the Services, to the extent such claim, controversy, or dispute cannot be amicably resolved by the parties, will be decided by binding individual arbitration before a single arbitrator, with the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court could.  The proceeding will be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules for the forum and will take place in the county in which you reside, unless another agreement is mutually agreed upon. 

22.2. YOU AND SUMUP MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SUMUP AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SUMUP MERCHANTS.

22.3. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim in your local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis. 

22.4. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases as discussed above) relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts of Boulder or Denver, Colorado, or federal court for the District of Colorado.

22.5. These Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Colorado law, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles that would require application of law of a different jurisdiction.
