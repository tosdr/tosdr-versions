This agreement is separated into three parts:  Part One contains terms relating to your use of the Services in general. Part Two contains terms relating to payment processing as part of the Services. Part Three contains additional terms relating to the legal relationship between you and SumUp.

**PART ONE - The Services**

1\. General

1.1. Our Services enable you to accept payment card transactions (“Transactions”) for your customers (“Cardholders”) by various means, including with the use of your compatible mobile device, our mobile application (“App” or “Software”), and a card acceptance device (“Terminal”). 

1.2. In order to use our Services, you must have a compatible mobile device and Internet connection services supplied to you by third parties. Such third parties may charge you for using a mobile device and/or Internet connection to access the Services, and you are solely responsible for the payment of such fees.  We provide an updated list of [compatible mobile devices](https://help.sumup.com/en-GB/articles/3lsOMJVzjefVJQnvQh7WrP-sumup-air-compatibility/) and accepted payment cards on our [website](https://help.sumup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013560440-SumUp-Card-Reader-Compatibility/).

1.3. When you accept Transactions using one of our Terminals, the Terminal will be used to process and authorize Transactions between the payment card and our servers.  We will cause any funds resulting from your Transactions to be credited to us, and we will pay out to your bank account any amounts owed to you under these Terms after we have received them ("Payout"). 

1.4. Before a Payout, we will deduct from the amount owed you the applicable fees we charge for use of the Services (“Fees”). In case you select a pricing plan (“Plan”) you shall pay any applicable recurring fees based on the Plan you select. Our current Fees and available Plans are listed on our [website](https://www.sumup.com/en-us/credit-card-processing-fees/). Fees and Plans are subject to change at SumUp’s discretion.

1.5. Our obligations under these Terms are limited to providing you with a SumUp Account and the Services. At our discretion, we may suspend the Services to be provided to you or limit the duration of the Services in order to perform maintenance services or if required by law or if you have failed to comply with material obligations under these Terms or if there is reasonable suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activity.

1.6. We may at any time terminate, suspend, update, or modify the Services with immediate effect without prior notification.

1.7. We reserve the right to appoint a third party in order to fulfill some or all of our obligations under these Terms.

2\. SumUp Account

2.1. To use the Services of SumUp you must register and sign up for a SumUp Account (“Account”). You confirm that all information you submit about you and/or your business is valid at the time of entering into these Terms. You must also keep the information that you provide up-to-date. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the Services of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, untimely, or incomplete information, or who fails to comply with the account registration requirements. Upon successful sign-up, you will receive a confirmation email sent to your registered email address. You may open only one (1) Account, unless we explicitly approve the opening of additional Accounts or sub-Accounts. You must ensure that the information recorded on your Account is always accurate and up to date.

2.2. You must choose a reasonably descriptive identification name that, if different from your company name, clearly identifies you or your business and provides your correct contact phone number. The identification name and the contact number you provide may appear on Cardholders’ credit or debit card statements.

2.3. When you have registered and signed up for an Account and accepted these Terms, we will perform checks in accordance with applicable know-your-customer, anti-money laundering, and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations as determined by us in our sole discretion.  We may run a credit check on you and/or require you to supply additional documentation in order for us to fulfill our obligations. You agree to assist us in that regard to the extent requested.

2.4. The decision whether your information has been properly verified and vetted according to section 2.3 will be entirely at our discretion. Until you have been successfully vetted by us, we reserve the right to terminate or not provide any Services under these Terms.

2.5. Your Account will be registered on one of our servers. We will hold an amount equal to any amounts owed to you by us separated from our own funds, but together with the amounts held on behalf of other Accounts, in a segregated bank account.

2.6. Funds owed to you by us will be paid out to a valid bank account designated by you in your Account.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the bank account information in your Account is accurate and up-to-date.  

2.7. If there is no transaction (excluding cash-only transaction(s)) activity in your SumUp Account a) within the first 60 days of account opening, or b) for 18 consecutive months, we may close your Account for inactivity. We are entitled to send a notification to your registered email address notifying you of this closure. if you do not respond to this notice within thirty (30) calendar days from the date listed within the closure email and state that you want to keep your Account, we will close it. Once an account has been closed due to inactivity, it may not be reopened. You may, however, apply to sign up for a new account, subject to applicable pricing, terms and conditions at the time of new account creation. Any remaining funds in your Account at the time of closure will be distributed according to the terms of the SumUp merchant agreement, and all applicable laws.

3\. Restrictions on Using the Services

3.1. By accepting these Terms, you confirm that you are either a legal resident of the United States, a United States citizen, or a business entity authorized to conduct business by the US state(s) in which you operate. The Services may only be used for business purposes in the United States. You may not export the Services directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Services may be subject to export restrictions imposed by US law.  It is your responsibility to comply with any such restrictions.

3.2. If you are a natural person, you must be eighteen (18) years or older to use the Services. We may require at any time that you provide evidence of your age.

3.3. By accepting these Terms, you agree to the rules and regulations set forth by relevant credit card organizations including, but not limited to Visa, Mastercard and American Express (collectively, “Card Schemes”). The Card Schemes require that you comply with their bylaws, rules, and regulations (“Network Rules”) and may require termination or limitation of these Terms at any time in the event of noncompliance.

3.4. The Card Schemes amend their rules and regulations from time to time. SumUp may be required to change these Terms in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. The Card Schemes may, at their sole discretion, cause SumUp to limit or terminate the Services.

3.5. The Network Rules may require that you enter into a separate agreement with one of our acquiring bank partners or the Card Schemes themselves depending on their volume of Transactions. In the event that more than $1,000,000 in credit card transactions (or such other amount provided by the Operating Regulations) (“Benchmark Amount”) is processed through and on behalf of Sub-Merchant in any 12-month period, Sub-Merchant will automatically be deemed to have accepted, and will be bound by, the “Merchant Services Agreement for Sub-Merchants” with Acquirer which is set forth [here](https://www.sumup.com/en-us/terms/submerchant-agreement/), the terms of which will be independently enforceable by Acquirer. If you are required to do so, we will notify you and provide you with a separate agreement at such time. In case of any conflict between these Terms and such agreement, the terms of the acquirer agreement shall prevail for the purposes of resolving this conflict.

3.6. You are not permitted to accept, and we are not obligated to process, Transactions related to goods and/or services that 

* are not provided by you or are provided by any third party other than you, including those businesses that may otherwise qualify themselves as a payment facilitator; 
    
* are not provided in the ordinary course of your business as identified to us;
    
* constitute accepting repayment of a credit previously granted or of a cash payment previously made by to you; 
    
* are prohibited or illegal under any applicable law or regulation or that pertain to activity that is prohibited or illegal under any applicable law or regulation;
    
* suggest illegal activity, including money laundering, terrorism financing, violations sanctions laws and regulations, or fraud;
    
* are deceptive, unfair, or predatory;
    
* are paid with Cards belonging to you or registered in your name;
    
* are prohibited by the relevant Card Scheme; or
    
* infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, including counterfeit goods or any product or service that infringes on the copyright, trademark or trade secrets of any third party.
    

Additional restrictions on certain commercial activity can be found in SumUp’s restricted businesses policy, which is available on our [website](https://help.sumup.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008338707/) and incorporated herein by reference.  We shall at our sole discretion decide whether your use of the Services violates this provision. 

3.7. If you submit to us or attempt to submit to us any Transaction we believe is in violation of these Terms or the law and/or exposes us, other users of our Services or our processors to harm (including without limitation fraud, brand or reputational damage or criminal acts) we reserve the right not to authorize, to put a hold on, suspend, or reverse the Transaction; and/or to close or suspend your Account; and/or to report the transaction to the relevant law enforcement agency; and/or to claim damages from you; and/or charge you an administration fee of up to $200 in the event we take any of the above actions.  Transactions may be held or suspended, with no Payout, until the expiration of the relevant Card Scheme’s chargeback period or until it is otherwise determined that no violation of these Terms or the law has occurred.  The determination of what circumstances warrant denying, holding, suspending, or reversing a Transaction is in the sole discretion of SumUp.

3.8. In accordance with the Network Rules, you agree to the following prohibitions: 

(i) You must not require a Cardholder to complete a postcard or similar device that includes the Cardholder’s account number, card expiration date, signature, or any other card account data in plain view when mailed. 

(ii) You must not add any tax to Transactions, unless applicable law expressly requires that you be permitted to impose a tax. Any tax amount, if allowed, must be included in the Transaction amount and not collected separately. 

(iii) You must not request or use a Cardholder’s account number for any purpose other than as payment for its goods or services. 

(iv) You must not disburse funds in the form of travelers checks, if the sole purpose is to allow the Cardholder to make a cash purchase of goods or services from you. 

(v) You must not disburse funds in the form of cash, unless dispensing funds in the form of travelers checks or foreign currency. In this case, the Transaction amount is limited to the value of the travelers checks or foreign currency, plus any commission or fee charged by you. 

(vi) You must not enter into interchange any transaction receipt for a Transaction that was previously charged back to the acquirer and subsequently returned to you, irrespective of Cardholder approval. You may pursue payment from the customer outside the system. 

(vii) You must not accept a Visa Consumer Credit Card or Commercial Visa Product, issued by a US bank, to collect or refinance an existing debt. 

(viii) You must not accept a card to collect or refinance an existing debt that has been deemed uncollectable by you providing the associated goods or services.

5\. Your Additional Obligations

5.1. You will not accept any Transactions where the payment card does not contain all of the elements that are typical for that type of card, where the payment card appears to be stolen, manipulated or damaged or where the payment card has expired.

5.2. Without our express permission, you must not set a minimum threshold that is higher than $1.00 for any Transaction. You will provide Cardholders with the same, if not better, payment terms as you provide to customers who pay in cash, and you will not charge Cardholders any additional amounts or surcharges.

5.3. You must monitor your Account and your Transaction history and refund to a Cardholder any Transaction funds that you received in error or in excess of the sale amount.

5.4. You will promptly inform us of any changes in the information that you provided at the time of entering into these Terms, including changes in the type or nature of your business, changes in the product range, any sale or lease of your company or any other change of ownership, any change of the legal form or name of your company, changes your address or bank account details, a material adverse change in your financial condition, and changes in the information that you provided as part of the onboarding and know-your-customer process.

5.5. You will display SumUp advertising material that you receive from us in plain view at your business premises. Such material may include stickers for your store, shop or car window with the SumUp logo and/or the Card Schemes’ logos and signs or leaflets required to be displayed by law, Card Schemes, or SumUp.

5.6. You shall make available to the Cardholder a paper-based receipt of the Transaction if required by law or Network Rules. Additionally, you may provide Cardholders with an option (but not in lieu of a paper-based receipt if such is required by law) to receive a receipt for the Transaction via email or text message.

5.7. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible to ensure that your Account login details are kept secure from any other person, that no user of the Terminal shall manipulate the data input and that there is no unauthorized use of your Account, Terminals or of any other confidential information associated with the use of the Services. If you suspect or know your Account has been used without authorization you must immediately notify us and change your Account login password. 

5.8. You are obligated to comply with applicable provisions of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”) during the duration of these Terms. In particular, you must comply with PCI-DSS standards with regard to the storage, processing and transmission of payment card data. Information about the PCI-DSS is available on the website of the PCI Council, http://pcisecuritystandards.org.

5.9. You must promptly review any statements (e.g., invoices or settlement statements) provided by us as well as the settlements, refunds, chargebacks or any other transactions, paid or charged to your bank account or the Cardholder. You must object to the statement without undue delay, at the latest within twenty-five (25) Business Days (“Business Day” meaning any day from Monday to Friday, excluding U.S. federal public holidays) after receipt of the relevant statement or date of the respective payment. Failure to object in time shall be deemed an approval. We reserve the right to reissue corrected statements or correct any payments after the expiration of this deadline. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for keeping records of all Transactions and other data related to your Account and your use of the Services.

6\. Additional services

6.1. SumUp may offer you other business services in addition to the Services set out above (“Additional Services”). These Additional Services may be provided by any member of our group of companies, including subsidiaries. To use Additional Services, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.  

6.2  SumUp may provide you with card-not-present payment services that enable you to accept e-commerce payments through a third party application (a “Partner Application”) i.e., through a mobile application or a website provided to you by another company (the “Partner”) under a separate commercial relationship between you and the Partner.  In such cases, we are only responsible for the payment services provided as part of the Partner Application. We are not responsible for the functionality of the Partner Application or any service provided to you or card holders by the Partner.  If agreed between you and the Partner, we may charge fees that not only cover our transaction fees but also include a charge on behalf of the Partner to collect funds that you owe to the Partner under the separate commercial agreement with the Partner.

**PART TWO - Payment Processing**

7\. Funds

7.1. You authorize us and any financial institution that we work with to hold, receive and disburse funds on your behalf in connection with the Services. This authorization will remain in full force and effect until your Account is closed or terminated. Payouts to your bank account will be executed, at least in part, by third party financial institutions (for example, the banks where you and SumUp have accounts) and we will not be responsible for the ultimate credit of funds to your bank account once we have paid out the funds to your bank.

7.2. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds in your Account. You irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to the funds in your Account.

7.3. We will not make any Payouts of funds related to transactions that have not yet been received by us from the designated financial institutions.

7.4. In the event it is necessary to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute relating to your Account, we may restrict access to your funds while we do so. We also may restrict access to your funds as required by law or court order.

8\. Reserve

8.1. For the purpose of securing the performance of your payment obligations under these Terms we may, at our sole discretion, at any time temporarily withhold Payouts to you and to accrue a reserve (“Reserve”).  We also may accrue, at our sole discretion, a Reserve based on the risk profile of you, your Account, and/or your Transactions. Any Reserve will remain in place as long as we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion.

8.2. The Reserve will also serve as a security in our favor and we shall be entitled to collect and set off from the Reserve all amounts that you owe us under these Terms, including any Account deficit balance, without prior notice to you. You authorize us to debit any amounts owed to us, including any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the collection of these amounts, from your bank account used to receive Payouts and/or your credit card or bank account used to purchase any of our Terminals or to set off such amounts against any Payouts owed to you. 

8.3.  If you owe us an amount that exceeds the amount of the Reserve, you will immediately, but not later than 3 (three) Business Days of our demand pay us the respective amount.  Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a serious breach of these Terms and you will bear all costs associated with collection of such amounts, including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.

9\. Chargebacks

9.1. The amount of a Transaction may be charged back to your Account if the Transaction is disputed; is reversed for any reason by the relevant Card Scheme, our processor, the Cardholder or any of our designated financial institutions; was not authorized; or we have any reason to believe that the Transaction was unauthorized, unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these Terms (“Chargeback”).

9.2. You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your Transactions processed through the Services, and you acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner, including providing necessary documentation not later than ten (10) Business Days from our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback. We reserve the right to charge a fee for investigating and/or mediating any Chargebacks, which fee will be disclosed on our [website](https://help.sumup.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008494708-Retrieval-Requests-Chargebacks-and-Fraud-Notifications/).

9.3. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by either the issuing bank or the Card Scheme, or if you choose not to contest a Chargeback, we have the right to collect from you the original Transaction amount plus the Fees and credit the original Transaction amount back to the Cardholder.

9.4. If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we are entitled to delay Payouts from the Account to your bank account, keep a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, or terminate or suspend the Services and close your Account.

9.5. You are responsible for any Chargeback to your Account, regardless of whether there are sufficient funds in your Account to cover the Chargeback amount.  SumUp may recoup any such unpaid Chargebacks from you by deducting the amount from your Account when funds become available or by any other lawful means, including taking legal action against you.

10\. Refunds and Returns

10.1. By accepting Transactions with the Services, you agree to process returns and provide refunds through your Account in accordance with these Terms and the Network Rules.

10.2. In accordance with the Network Rules, you must offer and disclose at the time of purchase a fair return and cancellation policy and not to give cash refunds on Transactions, except as required by law, and not to accept cash or any other item of value for making a Transaction refund.  The amount of the refund must include any and all taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount of the original Transaction.

10.3. In case of an exchange, partial return, or erroneous Transaction or Transaction amount, you will refund the total amount of the original Transaction first and then initiate a new Transaction for any new goods and/or services sold or amounts actually chargeable.

10.4. Refunds processed through your Account are authorized up to thirty (30) days from the day you initiated the Transaction for which a refund is sought. We will collect from you the original Transaction amount plus the Fees and credit the original Transaction amount back to the Cardholder.

10.5. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are processing an excessive amount of refunds, we may disable your refund option.

11\. Taxes

11.1. You are liable for determining, collecting, withholding, reporting and remitting to the appropriate tax authorities any and all taxes assessed, incurred, or required to be collected, paid, or withheld for any reason in connection with the use of our Services. If required to do so by a law or a government authority, we are authorized but not obligated to report your Account details and history of Transactions to the relevant authorities. We are not obligated to, nor will we, determine whether taxes apply, nor will we calculate, collect, report, or remit to any tax authority taxes arising from any Transaction. SumUp specifically disclaims any liability relating to taxes on Transactions.

11.2. You will not add any tax to a Transaction, unless applicable law expressly requires you to impose a tax. Any tax amount, if required, must be included in the Transaction amount and not collected separately.

**PART THREE - Additional Legal Terms**

12\. Limitations on Liability

12.1. YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER SUMUP NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES OR AGENTS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, ANTICIPATED PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS, INJURY TO BUSINESS REPUTATION, OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY OR CAUSE OF ACTION WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU WERE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

12.2. YOU AGREE THAT ANY LIABILITY OF SUMUP TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES COLLECTED FROM YOU IN THE THREE MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.   

12.3. YOU UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY SUMUP “AS IS,” AND NEITHER THE SERVICES NOR ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGY, CONTENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, NOR ANY OTHER INFORMATION, DATA, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES, WILL BE ALWAYS AVAILABLE, ACCESSIBLE, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR ERROR-FREE. YOU AGREE THAT SUMUP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DISRUPTIONS OR IMPAIRMENTS OF THE SERVICES.  

12.4. Nothing in these Terms shall exclude our liability for any statutory liability that cannot be excluded or amended by agreement between the parties.

12.5. SumUp does not warrant and will not be liable for actions or omissions of any third party involved in the Services or for third parties advertising on our website.
