**COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES, CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, AND BLOGS**

HSW wants to encourage an open exchange of information and ideas through the HSW Sites. But we cannot and do not review every posting made on HSW's community and social media sites, or in chat rooms, forums, blogs, and other public posting areas. You can expect these areas to include content, information, and opinions from a variety of individuals and organizations other than HSW. We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of any posting, regardless of whether the posting comes from a user, from a celebrity or "expert" guest, or from a member of our staff. There is no substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment.

Responsibility for what is posted on HSW's community and social media sites, or in chat rooms, forums, blogs and other public posting areas on the HSW Sites lies with each user -- you alone are responsible for material you post. HSW does not control the messages, information or other content that you or others may provide through the HSW Sites. You may use the HSW Sites for lawful purposes only.

By using the HSW Sites, you agree not to submit, post or transmit through the HSW Sites any material or otherwise engage in any conduct that:

· Violates or infringes the rights of others including, without limitation, patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, publicity, privacy or other proprietary rights;

· Collects for marketing purposes any email addresses or other personal information that has been posted by other users of the HSW Sites.

· Impersonates any person, business or entity, including HSW and its employees and agents or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person, business or entity, including HSW;

· Contains an advertisement or solicitation or encourages others to make a donation;

· Contains viruses or any other computer code, files or programs that interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment, or otherwise permit the unauthorized use of a computer or computer network;

· Encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense or that gives rise to civil liability or that otherwise encourages others to commit illegal activities or cause injury or property damage to any other person;

· Results in the posting or transmission of any message anonymously or under a false name;

· Permits any person to access, using your account, any features of the HSW Sites that may require registration;

· Results in a single message being posted to more than five areas of any HSW Site, results in any message being posted to any area of the HSW Sites if that message is, in our view, off-topic or in violation of this Visitor Agreement; or

· Violates these Terms of Use, guidelines or any policy posted on the HSW Sites, or interferes with the use of the HSW Sites by others.

Although HSW cannot monitor all content on HSW's community and social media sites, or postings in the chat rooms, forums, blogs and other public posting areas, you understand that HSW shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of the HSW Sites to determine compliance with this Visitor Agreement and any other operating rules that may be established by HSW from time to time. HSW shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to edit, move, delete, or refuse to post any material, including but not limited to Video Submissions, submitted to or posted on the HSW Sites for any reason, including violation of these Terms of Use, whether for legal or other reasons, or because the material is objectionable or stale. Notwithstanding this right of ours, users shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages and Video Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that neither HSW nor any of its affiliates shall assume or have any liability for any action or inaction by HSW with respect to any conduct within the HSW Sites or any communication or posting on the HSW Sites. HSW also reserves the right to disclose any information that HSW believes necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, or to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part.

HSW requires you not to use the HSW Sites to violate anyone's copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights. By posting or submitting any material (including, without limitation, photographs and videos) to the HSW Sites, you are warranting and representing that you own or have the right to post or make such submission of the material, or are making your submission or posting with the express consent of the owner, and that no other party has any right, claim, or interest in the material that you have submitted or posted. You also warrant that all moral rights in any material that you submit to us or post have been waived. Submitting or posting material that is the property of another, without the consent of its owner, is not only a violation of this Visitor Agreement, but may also subject you to legal liability for infringement of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights.

**USE OF MATERIALS**

With the exception of any and all Video Submissions (HSW's permitted use of which is discussed above) and any material posted on HSW's community and social media sites, all other material you submit to any of our chat rooms, forums, blogs and other public posting areas, whether text or images, becomes the property of HSW and may be reproduced, modified and distributed as we see fit, in any medium, for any purpose and in perpetuity. Further, you understand that by posting material on HSW's community and social media sites, you are granting to HSW, and to anyone authorized by HSW, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to display, use, copy, modify, transmit, sell, exploit, create derivative works from, distribute, and/or publicly perform such materials posted on HSW's community and social media sites, in whole or in part, in any manner or medium, now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose. The foregoing grant shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such posting or submission, including, but not limited to, rights under copyright, trademark, service mark or patent laws under any relevant jurisdiction. Also, in connection with the exercise of such rights, you grant HSW, and anyone authorized by HSW, the right to identify you as the author of any of your postings or submissions by name, email address or screen name, as HSW deems appropriate. Please also note the last paragraph in the **"COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA SITES, CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, AND BLOGS"** section above.

Of course, you're free to encourage others to access the information themselves on the HSW Sites, and to tell them how to find it.

**LINKING**

We welcome links to the HSW Sites. You are usually free to establish a hypertext link to any of the HSW Sites so long as the link does not state or imply any sponsorship or endorsement of your site by any of the HSW Sites or by HSW.

**TRADEMARKS**

We don't want anyone to be confused as to which materials and services are provided by HSW and which are not. You may not use any trademark or service mark appearing on the HSW Sites without the prior written consent of the owner of the mark.

**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY**

We work hard to make the HSW Sites interesting and enjoyable places, but we cannot guarantee that our users will always find everything to their liking. Please read this Disclaimer carefully before using any of the HSW Sites.

YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE HSW SITES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE HSW SITES, AND THE INHERENT HAZARDS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION, THERE MAY BE DELAYS, OMISSIONS, INACCURACIES OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH SUCH INFORMATION.

**MISCELLANEOUS**

The HSW staff works hard to ensure that information we post to the HSW Sites is both timely and accurate. But the news changes over time and reports that were accurate when posted may quickly become old news. Though we may post follow-up reports, and may continue to provide access to the original report, as in an archive of news stories, for example, we don't go back and change the original report to reflect new developments. If you're looking for the most recent information on a given subject, and not the history of how the story unfolded, be sure you're not looking at an out-of-date report.

To obtain access to certain services on the HSW Sites, you may be given an opportunity to register with the HSW Sites. As part of any such registration process, you will select a user name and a password. You agree that the information you supply during that registration process will be accurate and complete. You also agree not to (i) select, register, or attempt to register, or use a user name of another person with the intention of impersonating that person; (ii) use a user name of anyone else without authorization; (iii) use a user name in violation of the intellectual property rights of any person; or (iv) use a user name that HSW considers to be offensive. HSW reserves the right to reject or terminate any user name or password that, in its judgment, it deems offensive. You will be responsible for preserving the confidentiality of your password and will notify HSW of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account. Further, you agree that you are responsible for all statements made and acts or omissions that occur on your account while your password is being used. If you believe someone has used your password or account without your authorization, you must notify HSW immediately. HSW reserves the right to access and disclose any information including, without limitation, user names of accounts and other information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests. You must be at least 13 years old to register on HowStuffWorks.com.

This Visitor Agreement has been made in and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland. By using the HSW Sites, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Maryland, in all disputes arising out of or relating to this Visitor Agreement.

In the event that any portion of this Visitor Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other portion of this Visitor Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and be construed as if the invalid or unenforceable portion were not part of the Visitor Agreement.

Should you have any health care-related questions, please call or visit your physician or other health care provider. You should never disregard medical advice -- or delay in seeking it -- because of something you have read on HSW Sites. You should always seek prompt medical care for any specific health issue and consult a physician before starting a fitness regimen.

**ASSOCIATED PRESS CONTENT**

The HSW Sites include certain content owned by the Associated Press. Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing provisions of this Visitor Agreement, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (a) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, audio and/or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (b) no Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (c) the Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (d) the Associated Press is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Visitor Agreement and may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (e) the Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of Associated Press materials or any portion thereof at any time.
