### What is a third party cookie?

A third-party cookie is one which is not set by the website that you are visiting (eg. cookies set by youtube.com on zoho.com). Some of Zoho's own technologies and applications may be hosted in a domain that is a third-party to the domain that you may be visiting. However, our commitment extends to these domains (cdn.pagesense.io, js.zohocdn.com, \*.zohopublic.com, zoho.in, zoho.com.au, zoho.com) equally.

However, Zoho does not allow third-party tracking companies to set cookies or other trackers on our website as part of our commitment to protect the privacy of our users with the utmost care. When we embed content that is hosted on a third-party's platform on our website, the third-party may set cookies on your browser which are usually for the purposes of providing the service as intended (such as for bandwidth management, to store your preference of language, tracking consent and for collecting anonymous statistics such as the number of times a video has been streamed). Wherever possible, we choose the most privacy friendly options such as Privacy Mode, Anonymous Statistics Only, to ensure we guarantee you privacy. However, some of the properties of such embeds may not be fully under our control such as our ability to control cookies that are set by these third-parties unilaterally when the webpage embedded with such content loads.

Here is the list of the cookies set by such third-party company embeds on our website.
