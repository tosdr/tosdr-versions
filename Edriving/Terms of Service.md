YOU AGREE THAT YOU USE EDRIVING’S SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK.  UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY AND EXPRESSLY STATED ELSEWHERE, EDRIVING HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO ANY SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WHETHER SUCH WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.

##### **9\. Limitations of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE EDRIVING PARTIES BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY SERVICE, OR THE RESULTS THEREFROM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW (INCLUDING, E.G., AS PROHIBITED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY). PLEASE REFER TO YOUR LOCAL LAWS FOR ANY SUCH PROHIBITIONS.

##### **10\. Indemnification**

You hereby indemnify, defend and hold us, our owners, partners, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of such person’s or entities’ officers, directors, agents, contractors, subcontractors, guests, residents, visitors, licensees, invitees, permittees and employees (“Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all allegations, demands, claims, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties or costs of whatever nature (including reasonable attorneys’ and accountants’ fees) arising out of or in any way connected with these Terms, eDriving’s Services or any related act or failure to act by you and whether or not occasioned or contributed to by the negligence of eDriving or any agent or employee of the Indemnified Parties or any of them (except as and to the extent prohibited by applicable law) or claims related to infringement by you of the intellectual property rights of any person, including without limitation, copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, artist rights, droit moral, privacy, publicity or rights under other intellectual property laws.

##### **11\. Termination**

eDriving reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account (and, subject to applicable laws, delete the profile(s) corresponding to such account and any accompanying content) or your use any Service or Features or any other Service at any time, for any reason or for no reason. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any aspect of our Services and Features, products and services available on or through such Services at any time without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any of the foregoing.

##### **12\. Dispute Resolution**

If you are a citizen of the United States, you agree to the following dispute resolution terms:

**Binding Arbitration**  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to a Service, these terms or any other policies or other terms incorporated herein (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, enforceability, validity, or rights under any of any of the foregoing) (each, a “Dispute”) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to its choice of law principles.

You and eDriving each agree to submit exclusively to confidential, binding arbitration in the event of a Dispute.  The arbitration will be held in New Jersey on an individual basis and not as a class action.

You expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a dispute as a class action. You also expressly waive your right to a jury trial. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS ([http://www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/)). You may obtain a copy of the rules of JAMS by contacting the organization. Each of us shall agree on one arbitrator to conduct the arbitration. In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the JAMS rules. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless such fees are awarded by the arbitrator to the prevailing party.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, to the extent either party in any manner has violated or threatened to violate the other party’s intellectual property rights, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.

**Arbitration Final**  
The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on all parties. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state law concerning arbitration, governs all arbitration under this clause. Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator’s award. If any part of this clause, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the waiver of class action rights contained herein is not enforceable as to any person or persons, such non-enforceability shall apply to such person or persons only, and all other persons shall continue to be governed by the Arbitration Clause.

**Giving Up Right of Class Action**  
As stated above, these terms provide that all Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration and not in court or by jury trial. IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE EDRIVING PARTIES INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS INCLUDES GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AS SET FORTH IN ANY STATE STATUTE.

**Additional Limit on Claims**  
Except as otherwise prohibited by law, any Dispute must be brought within one (1) year from the date the cause of action arises.

##### **13\. Miscellaneous** 

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

These Terms and any other policies or other terms incorporated herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and eDriving relating to your use of any other Service and the use, handling, and rights to personal information submitted or provided by you, superseding any other agreement between you and eDriving with respect to the subject matter hereof.  Section headings in these terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these terms or any other policies or other terms incorporated herein shall be found to be unenforceable, the other provisions shall still remain in full force and effect.

##### **14\. OTHER Country Specific Terms**

NONE.
