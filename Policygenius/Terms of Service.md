### The services

Insurance Services. The Services include our Personal Insurance Checkup, which consists of content, tools, links and recommendations intended to provide you with decision support related to insurance. All information provided to you through your use of this Service is provided for general informational and educational purposes.

The Services may also include our preparation of quotes and brokering and transacting of sales to you of third-party insurance products. We are a licensed independent insurance broker. We do not underwrite any insurance policy made available to you through the Services. Any insurance policy premium quotes or ranges displayed on the Site or through the Services are non-binding. The final insurance policy premium for any policy is determined by the underwriting insurance company following application. Insurance products and their availability may vary by state and your individual circumstances, and additional minimum coverage limits may be required in your state. The third-party insurance products offered for sale through the Site are only available in the jurisdictions in which we are properly licensed.

Your use of certain Services may require you to agree to additional terms and conditions, or enter into separate agreements with us or applicable third-party insurance carriers. Any third-party insurance products purchased by you through the Site are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable insurance carrier. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the terms of any such other terms, the terms of such other terms will control.

Will and Estate Planning Services. The Services also include, for your convenience, self-help “fill in the blank” forms that help you prepare simple wills, trusts, and other estate planning documents (together with any related instructions and resulting documentation, the “Forms”) (the “Will and Estate Planning Services”). We are not a law firm and are not licensed to practice law. We may not, and do not, provide legal representation or advice. No attorney-client relationship is created or intended to be created between you and Policygenius or its employees or agents. Communications between you and Policygenius are not protected by the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. OUR SERVICES AND OUR FORMS ARE PROVIDED FOR YOUR PERSONAL USE ONLY. THEY DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. OUR SERVICES AND OUR FORMS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ADVICE OR SERVICES OF AN ATTORNEY OR TAX CONSULTANT. We do not review the information you provide for completeness, legal sufficiency, or accuracy, nor do we draw any legal conclusions, provide opinions, or make recommendations about the selection of forms, nor do we apply the facts of your particular situation to the law. The law is a personal matter, and no generalized information or one form (i.e., the Forms) is applicable to every situation. You should consult with an attorney or tax professional if: you have any questions about the accuracy, sufficiency, or effect of any completed Forms or related documents; you have any questions about the Forms’ legal effects or tax implications; you want legal or tax advice on any specific issues; or if you think your situation may be too complex to be addressed by our Forms.

### Disclaimers of warranties

“As is”. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE POLICYGENIUS PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NEITHER POLICYGENIUS, ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS (EACH A “POLICYGENIUS PARTY” AND COLLECTIVELY THE “POLICYGENIUS PARTIES”) MAKE ANY WARRANTY THAT THE POLICYGENIUS PROPERTIES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS, OR WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE, COMPLETE, LEGAL OR SAFE. THE POLICYGENIUS PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO, OR VIRUSES THAT MAY INFECT, YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, DEVICES OR OTHER PROPERTY ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE, THE SERVICES, OR ANY CONTENT. IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST USE. INFORMATION AND OPINIONS RECEIVED VIA THE POLICYGENIUS PROPERTIES SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR PERSONAL, MEDICAL, LEGAL OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT AN APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL FOR SPECIFIC ADVICE TAILORED TO YOUR SITUATION.

THE SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS, CANCELLATIONS AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS. THE POLICYGENIUS PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR CONDITION WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE QUALITY, EFFECTIVENESS, REPUTATION AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF SERVICES.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM US OR THROUGH POLICYGENIUS PROPERTIES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

No Liability for Conduct of Third Parties. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE POLICYGENIUS PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE, AND YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK TO HOLD POLICYGENIUS PARTIES LIABLE, FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES, AND THAT THE RISK OF INJURY FROM SUCH THIRD PARTIES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

Insurance Checkup Services. THE RESULTS OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE CHECKUP ARE BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA PROVIDED BY YOU AND RECEIVED BY US. THE RESULTS ARE PROVIDED FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND EDUCATION ONLY AND ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL ADVICE. YOUR INSURANCE NEEDS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE PERSONAL INSURANCE CHECKUP RESULTS, DEPENDING ON DETAILS WE DID NOT CAPTURE IN OUR PERSONAL INSURANCE CHECKUP QUESTIONNAIRE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AMOUNT OF YOUR DEDUCTIBLES, THE TERMS OF YOUR EMPLOYER-PROVIDED INSURANCE COVERAGE, THE IDENTITY OF YOUR INSURANCE CARRIERS, AND YOUR HEALTH HISTORY). THE PERSONAL INSURANCE CHECKUP RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE, OR AS A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY OR FOREGO ANY INSURANCE PRODUCT, WITHOUT DOING FURTHER RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN OR WITH A FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL. ALTHOUGH WE USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THE RESULTS OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE CHECKUP ARE ACCURATE, NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ACCURACY OR WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OF ANY OTHER CONTENT.

Other Insurance Products and Services. ANY AND ALL INSURANCE PRODUCTS QUOTED OR SOLD THROUGH THE SITE ARE THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND ARE NOT OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PRODUCTS, AND WE ACCEPT NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PRODUCTS. ALL SUCH PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE INSURANCE CARRIER PROVIDING SUCH PRODUCTS. ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS, CONCERNS OR DISPUTES WITH ANY SUCH PRODUCTS SHOULD BE RAISED WITH THE INSURANCE CARRIER PROVIDING SUCH PRODUCTS AND NOT WITH US.

### Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE POLICYGENIUS PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, REVENUES OR SAVINGS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE POLICYGENIUS PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE GREATER OF (A) THE FEES PAID BY YOU WITHIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT, OMISSION OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; (B) THE REMEDY OR PENALTY IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES; AND (C) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500.00). ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITE IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE OR COMPUTER SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE POLICYGENIUS PROPERTIES IS TO STOP USING THE SAME.

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES, IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

Release. You hereby release and forever discharge us (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Policygenius Properties (including any interactions with, or act or omission of External Sites). If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN POLICYGENIUS AND YOU.

### External sites

The Site may contain links to third-party websites and applications, including, without limitation, the websites of the insurance carriers offering the third-party insurance products made available to you through the Services (“External Sites”). We provide these External Sites only as a convenience. We do not review, approve, monitor, warrant, endorse, control or make any representations with respect to and we are not responsible for the content of any linked External Sites, or any product or service provided in connection therewith. When you click on a link to an External Site, we will not warn you that you have left the Policygenius Properties and are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. You use all External Sites at your own risk. When you leave our Site, our Terms of Use and policies no longer govern. Before using any External Site, please refer to the terms of use and privacy policies of the External Sites for more information.

App Stores. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App and the Services is dependent on the third party from whom you received the App license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (each, an “App Store”). You acknowledge that the Terms of Use are between you and us and not with the App Store. We, not the App Store, are solely responsible for the Policygenius Properties, including the App, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the App, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Policygenius Properties, including the App. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the App is conditioned upon your compliance with all terms of agreement imposed by the applicable App Store when using any Policygenius Property, including the App. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Agreement and will have the right to enforce it.

### Indemnification

You shall defend, indemnify, and hold the Policygenius Parties, and assigns, harmless from and against any claims, actions, or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from: (i) Your Content, (ii) your breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your access to, use, or misuse of the Policygenius Properties; or (iv) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.

### Term; termination

Subject to this section, these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect while you use the Site or the App. We may terminate these Terms of Use and your access to all or any part of the Policygenius Properties at any time and for any reason without prior notice or liability. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Policygenius Properties at any time without prior notice or liability. Termination of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service.

If your registration(s) with or ability to access the Policygenius Properties, or any other Policygenius community is discontinued by us due to your violation of any portion of the Terms of Use or for conduct otherwise inappropriate for the community, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access any Policygenius Properties or any Policygenius community through use of a different member name or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those Policygenius Properties to which your access has been terminated. In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or warning to you.

Termination of any Services includes removal of access to such Services and barring of further use of the Services. Termination of all Services also includes deletion of your password and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof), including Your Content. Upon termination of any Service, your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of Services may involve deletion of Your Content associated therewith from our live databases. We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.

### Dispute resolution. PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Policygenius and our employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to the Policygenius Properties or these Terms of Use shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or JAMS. As modified by these Terms of Use, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s or JAMS’s rules for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for consumer-related disputes.

You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.

You and we must abide by the following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (6) the arbitrator’s award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction; (7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees’ and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.

With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in the above stated rules (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Agreement, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either subparts (1) and (2) in the above stated rules (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York, New York.

Notwithstanding any provision in this these Terms of Use to the contrary, if we seek to terminate the Dispute Resolution section as included in these Terms of Use, any such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms of Use not containing the agreement to arbitrate is posted to the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim of which you provided us with written notice prior to the date of termination.

For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org. For more information on JAMS, it’s Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call JAMS at 800-352-5267 or visit the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com.

Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and us and our employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to these Terms or the Site shall exclusively be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law rules and without regard to conflicts of laws principles except that the arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these Terms of Use.

You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Dispute Resolution section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: legal@policygenius.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this section. Your notice must include your name and address, your Policygenius username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this section of the Terms of Use. If you opt out of this section, all other parts of these Terms of Use will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this section has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

### Miscellaneous

In the event that any portion of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such portion shall be construed in accordance with the applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. This section, the section entitled Indemnification, and the sections entitled “Indemnification,” “Disclaimers of Warranties,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Term; Termination,” “Unsolicited Information,” “Intellectual Property,” “Dispute Resolution,” and “Miscellaneous” shall survive the termination of these Terms of Use. We shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. You may not assign these Terms of Use. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms of Use to initiate litigation in a court and except for proceedings commenced by us to protect our intellectual property or confidential information which may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties mutually agree that any and all disputes arising hereunder shall be resolved exclusively by state or federal courts located in New York, New York. These Terms of Use contain the entire agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersede all existing agreements and all other oral, written or other communication between the parties concerning its subject matter. The Policygenius Properties may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from us, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.
