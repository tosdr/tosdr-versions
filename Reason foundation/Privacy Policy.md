Privacy Policy
==============

Effective: 10/10/2022

Reason Foundation is committed to protecting your privacy and taking great care of your personal information. Our Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, how it is used, and how it is protected. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at feedback@reason.org.

This Privacy Policy details our practices associated with the collection of your personally identifiable information ("**Personal Information**") in the course of your use of Reason.com or Reason.org ("Site"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website that you access from our Site or that you use to access our Site from, which have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that may differ from this Privacy Policy.

**What Information We Collect**

**Personal Information we collect directly from you**

The Personal Information we may receive or may collect directly from you includes, without limitation, the following:

(1) contact data (such as your mailing or billing address, e-mail address, and phone number);

(2) demographic data (such as your gender, your date of birth and your zip code);

(3) payment data (such as a credit card number of payment account information); and

(4) other identifying information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, such as unique identifiers like passwords, Personal Information in emails or letters that you send to us, and other information.

We may also collect additional information as described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. You may still access our Site if you choose not to provide us with any Personal Information, but if you elect not to share Personal Information it may affect our ability to provide products or services to you.

**Billing and payment information**

When you make a payment for subscriptions, donations, or other purposes through our Site, your payment card information is collected and stored by our payment processing partner. Our payment processing partner collects your voluntarily provided payment card information necessary to process your payment. Such partner's use and storage of information is governed by its applicable terms of service and privacy policy.

**Information we automatically collect when you use our site**

Some information, which may include Personal Information, may be automatically collected when you use our Site, such as the following: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) type of device(s) used to access the Site; (iv) web browser(s) used to access the Site; (v) referring webpage or other source through which you accessed the Site; (vi) geolocation information; and (vii) other statistics and information associated with the interaction between your browser or device and the Site (collectively "**Traffic Data**"). Depending on applicable law, some Traffic Data may be Personal Information.

**How We Collect Information**

We collect information (including Personal Information and Traffic Data) when you use and interact with the Site, and in some cases from third party sources. Such means of collection include:

(1) When you use the Site to purchase products or services;

(2) When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the Site or through responses to interviews, surveys, questionnaires, comments and the like;

(3) Through cookies, web beacons, analytics services and other tracking technology (collectively, "**Tracking Tools"**), as described below; and

(4) When you sign up to receive emails from us regarding events, products, specials or other marketing and promotional materials; and

(5) When you contact us.

**Tracking tools, behavioral advertising, and opt out options**

**Tracking tools:** We may use tools outlined below in order to provide our services to advertise to, and to better understand users.

 **(1) Cookies:** "Cookies" are small computer files transferred to your computing device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We use cookies to improve or tailor the Services, customize advertisements by tracking navigation habits, measuring performance, and storing authentication status so re-entering credentials is not required, customize user experiences with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. For more information on cookies, including how to control your cookie settings and preferences, visit [**http://www.allaboutcookies.org**](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Some cookies are placed by a third party on your device and provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site, the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These cookies can be used to determine whether certain third-party services are being used, to identify your interests, and to serve advertisements relevant to you. We do not control third party cookies.

**(2) Web beacons:** "Web Beacons" (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use of our Site, the websites of selected advertisers and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Site, using selected publishers' websites or opening emails, and for what purpose, and also allows us to enhance our interest-based advertising (discussed further below).

**(3) Web service analytics:** We may use third-party analytics services in connection with the Site, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text typed into the Site. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Site easier to use and as otherwise set forth in the section called "How We Use Your Information." These analytics services generally do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across web services that do not use their services.

Reason.com uses Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to track visitor demographics for the purposes of measuring the interest levels of various segments of our readership and engagement with website content. Reason does not link your reading history or other actions on Reason.com with personally identifiable information such as your name or email address. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting using [ad settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).

**Behavioral advertising:** We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools, such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to collect information about a user's online activities to display Reason ads to the user based on the user's interests ("**Behavioral advertising**"). Such partners may include third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks or platforms, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, "**Advertising service providers**"). Other Tracking Tools used by our partners may collect information when you use the Site, such as IP address, operating system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic information, such as gender and age range. These Tracking Tools help us learn more about our users' demographics and internet behaviors.

**Options for opting out of cookies:** Many web browsers allow you to reject cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer.

You may opt out of receiving certain cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) [**opt out page**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) [**consumer opt-out page**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed). When you use these opt-out features, an "opt-out" Cookie will be placed on your computer. If you delete cookies on your computer, you may need to opt out again.

Even after opting out of Behavioral Advertising, you may still see Reason advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean that Reason is no longer using Tracking Tools — we still may collect information about your use of the Site even after you have opted out of Behavioral Advertising and may still serve advertisements to you via the Site based on information it collects via the Site.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and other Tracking Tools by any third parties, and we aren't responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that some cookies placed by third parties can continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Site.

**How we use your information**

We may use information that is not Personal Information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated to better understand who uses our Site and how we can deliver a better experience or otherwise at our discretion.

When you visit our website, log in, register or open an email, cookies, ad beacons, and similar technologies may be used by our online data partners or vendors to associate these activities with information they or others have about you, including your email address. We (or service providers on our behalf) may then send communications and marketing to these email addresses. You may opt out of receiving this advertising by visiting [https://app.retention.com/optout.](https://app.retention.com/optout)

We use information, including Personal Information, to provide and to help improve the Site, to develop new services, and to advertise (for example, to display Reason ads on other web services). Specifically, such use may include:

(2) Responding to correspondence that we receive from you;

**(3) Cross device matching**: To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data). To supplement this analysis, we also provide de-identified data to these partners. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of Site across devices.

**(5) Public information and submissions**: You agree that any information that you may reveal in a review posting, online discussion, or forum is intended for the public and is not in any way private. Carefully consider whether to disclose any Personal Information in any public posting or forum. Your submissions may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage.

Please keep your e-mail address in your account up to date. You can update that e-mail address anytime in your account. If you have difficulty updating your e-email address or other information on your account, please contact us at feedback@reason.org. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. You may also use this e-mail address to request a print copy, at no charge, of an electronic notice we have sent to you regarding a compromise of your Personal Information.
