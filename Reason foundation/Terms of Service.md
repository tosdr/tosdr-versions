Accessing the Websites, in any manner, for the purpose of obtaining information, technical or otherwise, constitutes use of the Websites such that these Terms of Use bind the party accessing the Websites. Reason Foundation may need to change these Terms of Use or impose new conditions on use of the Websites, from time to time, in which case we will post the revised Terms of Use on the Websites. By continuing to use the Websites after we post any such changes, you accept the Terms of Use, as modified.

You are free to link to and cite the Websites so long as the context does not state or imply any sponsorship of your site by Reason Foundation.

**LICENSE TO REASON FOUNDATION  
**By posting messages, uploading files, or otherwise providing any material for display on the Websites, you are representing that you are the owner of the material, or are making your submission with the consent of the owner of the material, all information you provide is true, accurate, current and complete and does not violate these Terms of Use. In addition, when you post a message, upload a file, or otherwise provide us with material for display on the Websites, you are granting Reason Foundation a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to use, copy, sublicense, modify, adapt, transmit, distribute, publicly perform or display such material.

To use certain features, you will need a username and password, which you will receive or create through the applicable site's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are responsible for all activities (whether by you or by others) that occur under your password or account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.

Reason Foundation's linking to any third party sites does not imply an endorsement or sponsorship of such sites or the information, products or services offered on or through the sites.

You release Reason Foundation and its partners, affiliates, suppliers, licensors, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives, contractors, agents and content providers from any damages that you incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them arising from or relating to your purchase or use of any products or services made available by third parties through Reason Foundation.
