###### 7\. Use of Cookies

Cookies are a feature of web browsers that allow web servers to temporarily store information within your browser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. We encourage you to accept the cookies we serve. However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by our or any other website, you can do this through your browser settings. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our Website.  
We place the following cookies on your device when you browse this Website:  
  

1. 1. **Google Analytics:** The Website uses Google Analytics; a web analysis service of Google, Inc. Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the Website. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our Website, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.  
        Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage. You can find additional information on the [Google Analytics Opt-out browser add-on Download Page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.).  
        Additionally, Google Analytics cookies may be embedded in GitBook, a knowledge-sharing documentation platform used by us to host Assets and facilitate better collaboration. A new visitor receives a cookie warning and has the option to reject all cookies. Please read the [GitBook Cookie Policy](https://policies.gitbook.com/privacy/cookies) to learn more.  
          
        
    2. **Third-party Cookies:** Pages that have YouTube videos embedded may enable YouTube to set certain cookies. Read [YouTube’s Cookie Policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies) for more details. Similarly, GitHub uses its own cookies for analytics purposes. You can learn about this in [GitHub’s Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking) and on the [GitHub Subprocessors and Cookies Page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-subprocessors-and-cookies).
