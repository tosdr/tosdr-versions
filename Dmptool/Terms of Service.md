Terms of use & Privacy policy
=============================

The [California Digital Library (CDL)](http://www.cdlib.org/) is supported by the University of California (UC). Our primary constituency is the UC research community; in addition, we provide services to the United States and international higher education sector.

DMP Tool
--------

DMP Tool ('the tool', 'the system') is a tool developed by the CDL and the [Digital Curation Centre (DCC)](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/) as a shared resource for the research community. It is hosted at CDL by the University of California Curation Center (UC3).

Your personal details
---------------------

In order to help identify and administer your account with the DMP Tool, we need to store your email address. We may also use it to contact you to obtain feedback on your use of the tool, or to inform you of the latest developments or releases. The information may be transferred between the CDL and DCC partner organizations but only for legitimate CDL purposes. We will not sell, rent, or trade any personal information you provide to us.

* * *

Privacy statement
-----------------

The information you enter into this system can be seen by you, people you have chosen to share access with, and—solely for the purposes of maintaining the service—system administrators at the CDL. We compile anonymized, automated, and aggregated information from plans, but we will not directly access, make use of, or share your content with anyone beyond CDL and your home institution without your permission. Authorized users at your home institution may access your plans for specific purposes—for example, to track compliance with funder/institutional requirements, to calculate storage requirements, or to assess demand for data management services across disciplines. For a detailed description of what information (other than the plans) we collect from visitors to this website and how it is used and managed, please see the CDL Privacy Statement and Baseline Supporting Practices listed at [https://cdlib.org/about/policies-and-guidelines/privacy-statement/](https://cdlib.org/about/policies-and-guidelines/privacy-statement/)

Freedom of Information
----------------------

The CDL holds your plans on your behalf, but they are your property and responsibility. Any FOIA applicants will be referred back to your home institution.

* * *

Sharing and Reuse
-----------------

**Users who choose Public visibility for their plans** grant the California Digital Library on behalf of The Regents of the University of California a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free right to publish, reproduce, publicly display, adapt, and distribute their plan in perpetuity, worldwide, by any method or media now known or later developed.

**Users who choose to use the DMP Tool to create a DOI (Digital Object Identifier aka DMP ID) for their plans** grant the California Digital Library on behalf of The Regents of the University of California a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free right to publish, reproduce, publicly display, adapt, and distribute portions of their plans in perpetuity, worldwide, by any method or media now known or later developed. The portions that will be published are those necessary to provide sufficient information about the plan associated with the DOI, including the project description and descriptions of planned outputs, but does not include the full text of the plan unless the user has chosen public visibility for the plan.

**All users** grant the California Digital Library on behalf of The Regents of the University of California permission to: 1) **preserve** the material they provide to the DMP Tool and to perform any copying or distribution that is appropriate in order to maintain that material, including but not limited to format migration and adaptations necessary for accessibility remediation; 2) **distribute** their plan to administrators or others at their organization as directed by the user-defined plan visibility; and 3) **use their material in research** regarding improvements to the DMP Tool or data management practices, including use in artificial intelligence training within California Digital Library's local environment.
