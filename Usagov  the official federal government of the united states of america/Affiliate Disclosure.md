USA.gov linking policy
======================

Learn about linking to USA.gov and find out when and why we link to other websites. Read our disclaimer of endorsement.

**Linking to USA.gov**
----------------------

USA.gov ([www.usa.gov](https://www.usa.gov/)) is the official guide to government information and services. You may link to USA.gov at no cost.

When you link to USA.gov, please do it in an appropriate context as a service to your audience when they need to find official U.S. government information and services. 

We encourage federal agencies to use the U.S. Web Design System's [identifier component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/identifier/) to link to USA.gov. The identifier includes the link to USA.gov plus all the other [required links](https://digital.gov/resources/required-web-content-and-links/) that all federal websites need to have.

You can also link to [USAGov en Español](https://www.usa.gov/es/), the official Spanish language website of the U.S. government.

**Links from USA.gov to other websites**
----------------------------------------

### **Links to government websites**

USA.gov links to publicly available websites that are government owned or government sponsored and are on the .gov, .mil, and .fed.us website domains.

USA.gov also links to:

* Quasi-government agencies and websites created by public sector/private sector partnerships
* State and local government sites 
* Government-sponsored websites that end in .com, .org, or .net (such as [www.usps.com](https://www.usps.com/) for the U.S. Postal Service)

### **Links to non-government websites**

USA.gov links to select websites that are not government-owned or government-sponsored. We do this if these websites provide government information in a way that is not available on an official government website. USA.gov provides these non-government websites as a public service only.

### **Disclaimer of endorsement**

The U.S. government, including the U.S. General Services Administration (the primary sponsoring federal agency of USA.gov), neither endorses nor guarantees in any way the external organizations, services, advice, or products included in these website links. Furthermore, the U.S. government neither controls nor guarantees the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of the information contained in non-government website links.
