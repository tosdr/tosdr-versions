User Disputes
-------------

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other ShoutWiki users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other users.

Collection of personal information
----------------------------------

User information is stored on servers in the United States and other countries. The only information that you need give is a username and password. The username does not need to be your real name. Therefore, any personal information you choose to give is not compulsory. ShoutWiki sites are not intended for, and may not be used by, children under the age of 13 years old. You may change your email in your user preferences. If you choose to enter a real name in your preferences, this will be publicly available. However, this field is optional, and there is no requirement for any user to give a real name.

Information from our server logs may be stored and used to gather aggregate data about users, and used to determine whether the identity of one or more users is the same in cases of abuse. This data includes your IP address, and details about your browser. Your browser must permit cookies to be set (by \*.shoutwiki.com) in order for you to log in to ShoutWiki. If you do not make an account on any wiki, you need not accept cookie requests from this site.

Edits by users who are not logged in will show the user's IP address in the page history of the article they edited, and also in other places on the site, including watchlists and recent changes, and in any external feeds made of such pages.

Submissions
-----------

You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information about the Site or the Service ("Submissions"), provided by you to ShoutWiki are non-confidential and shall become the sole property of ShoutWiki. ShoutWiki shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.

Termination
-----------

ShoutWiki may terminate or suspend any and all Services and your user account immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any of the terms or conditions of the Terms of Use. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Services. All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

Other
-----

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and ShoutWiki regarding the use of the Site and/or the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and ShoutWiki relating to your use of the Site or the Service. The failure of ShoutWiki to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance.

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Supremacy of English Language Terms of Use
------------------------------------------

Where a translation of these Terms of use is inconsistent with the English language version, the English language version shall prevail.
