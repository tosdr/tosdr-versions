* You acknowledge and agree that you have school consent to allow children under 13 years of age to use the Service. Access to the Service is limited to those student users from whom school personnel has received, where mandatory per applicable laws, valid Consent forms and complies with all parental requests regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such child's information. School personnel or the educational institution are responsible for providing parental consent forms to the parents of potential student users, for confirming receipt of valid consent forms for each child before granting the student access to the Service, and for retaining such consent forms on file.

#### FERPA and Student Data

Certain information that may be provided to Conjuguemos by school personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution, may be considered an education record ("Education Record") under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). Additionally, certain information, provided to Conjuguemos by school personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA ("Directory Information") and thus not an Education Record. A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA ("FERPA Exemption(s)"), including the exemption for Directory Information ("Directory Information Exemption") or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest ("School Official Exemption").

As school personnel or the Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to Conjuguemos, you acknowledge, affirm and pledge to Conjuguemos, as applicable, that your Institution has:

* complied with the Directory Information Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools do not disclose directory information about them; and/or
* complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights that the Institution defines "school official" to include service providers and defines "legitimate educational interest" to include services such as the type provided by Conjuguemos; or
* obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the Directory Information and Education Records with the Company, in each case, solely to enable the Company's operation of the Service.

Conjuguemos will never share Education Records with third parties except (i) as directed by an Conjuguemos user (i.e., teacher sharing with another teacher or parent); or (ii) to our service providers that are necessary for us to provide the Service, as stated in our Privacy Policy. Education Records are never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents. Additionally, information collected directly from a student using Conjuguemos is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information collected from a student is never sold or rented to anyone. This section shall not be construed (i) to prohibit Conjuguemos from marketing or advertising directly to parents, where applicable, so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Education Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of Conjuguemos to use student information or Education Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.

Conjuguemos may use Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes ("De-Identified Data"). De-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed. Conjuguemos agrees not to attempt to re-identify the De-Identified Data and not to transfer the De-Identified Data to a third party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.

#### GDPR and Minors

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) determines that the processing of personal data of a child residing in the European Union shall be lawful where the child is at least sixteen (16) years old, unless Member States have provided, by law, a lower age that is not below thirteen (13) years.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AFFIRM AND PLEDGE TO CONJUGUEMOS THAT YOU OR YOUR INSTITUTION HAVE OBTAINED ALL NECESSARY PARENTAL OR ELIGIBLE STUDENT WRITTEN CONSENT TO SHARE THE PERSONAL DATA OF YOUR STUDENTS WITH CONJUGUEMOS, IN EACH CASE, SOLELY TO ENABLE CONJUGUEMOS'S OPERATION OF THE SERVICE.

If you have any issues with Conjuguemos's principles set out in these terms, please reach out to support@conjuguemos.com. We will respond to your complaints within thirty (30) days. If your complaint cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we will direct you to the state or national data protection authority in the jurisdiction where you reside.

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

#### Dispute Resolution

(A) Generally: in the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, including any other Guidelines and future modifications, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

(B) Exceptions: notwithstanding subsection (A), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

(C) Arbitration: any arbitration between you and the Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting the Company.

(D) Notice: a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). The Company's address for Notice is:

  
Conjuguemos  
PO Box 86  
Newton, MA 02456  
United States of America

The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or the Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Provided that our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, the Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the greatest amount offered by the Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.

(E) Fees: in the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made withi fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

(F) No Class Actions: you and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Furthermore, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

(G) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of San Franscisco, California, shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.
