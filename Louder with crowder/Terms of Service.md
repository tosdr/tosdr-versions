YOU USE THE SITE AND SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LOUDER WITH CROWDER LLC AND ITS AFFILIATES, DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, CORPORATE AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS (REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS "AFFILIATES") DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE AND SERVICES (INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT).

IN PARTICULAR, LOUDER WITH CROWDER LLC AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY, QUANTITY, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY COMMENTS OR OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES) OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES LINKED TO THE SITE OR SERVICES. LOUDER WITH CROWDER LLC AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY: (A) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (B) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES; (C) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION; (D) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE OR SERVICES; (E) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES BY ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (F) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, E-MAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS OR IN ANY APPLICABLE ADDITIONAL TERMS, LOUDER WITH CROWDER LLC AND ITS AFFILIATES DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE RECOMMENDED, ADVERTISED OR OFFERED FOR SALE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES OR ANY LINKED WEBSITE.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER LOUDER WITH CROWDER LLC NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF, KNEW OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent Louder with Crowder LLC may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Louder with Crowder LLC's liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.

### 12\. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Louder with Crowder LLC and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs), arising from or relating to: (a) any information (including feedback or any other content) that you or anyone using your account submit, post, or transmit through the Site or Services; (b) the use of the Site or Services by you or anyone using your account; (c) the violation of these Terms by you or anyone using your account; or (d) the violation of any rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary rights by you or anyone using your account. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. If we do assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.

### 13\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms (or the interpretation, performance, or breach of them), the Site, or the Services, including but not limited to alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a "Dispute") shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If we are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to the JAMS/Endispute Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect as of the date hereof, including the Optional Appeal Procedure provided for in such rules (the "Arbitration Rules"). The arbitration shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas, before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by these Terms, including any applicable Additional Terms. No Disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the individual Dispute and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE. ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THESE TERMS MUST BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against any party. Without limiting the foregoing, any lawsuit filed relating to these Terms, the Site, Services, or your relationship with us, must be filed in the state or federal courts sitting in Dallas, Texas and you agree to irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts.

### 14\. OTHER PROVISIONS

We will be excused from failures or delays in delivery or performance of the Site and/or Services, if such failure or delay is attributable to causes beyond our reasonable control including but not limited to weather, acts of God, natural disaster, war, terrorist attack, disease, epidemic/pandemic, criminal activity, riot, civil unrest, strike, or utility failure.

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions. It is the parties' intention that the court or arbitrator modify such invalid provision to give it the fullest effect permissible under applicable law.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not act as a waiver of such right or provision and will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision or any other right or provision in the future.

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted to you hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without our written permission. We may assign or transfer our rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without restriction, including without limitation in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law.

### 15\. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

We may, in our sole discretion, modify the Terms from time to time. If a change is material, as determined by us in our sole discretion, we will provide at least fourteen (14) days' notice prior to the effective date of the change via a post on the Site and/or email to you. By not terminating your relationship with us prior to the effective date of the change, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by the updated Terms. We suggest periodically visiting this page of the Site to review these Terms.
