* To advertise to you via behavioral/targeted advertising and allow others to do the same.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent this. If you disable cookies, your ability to use some features of the Sites may be limited. For mobile devices, you may be able to manage certain cookies using your built-in mobile device settings and controls. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset. You should check how to do this on your device(s) and operating systems.

Some of these cookies may be placed by third-party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. The use of cookies by third-party service providers is within their control and not ours. We do not control their websites or their policies and practices regarding your Personal Information, and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites you encounter on the Internet. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third-party service provider may directly collect from you, and we do not undertake to confirm, investigate, or police their practices.

Along those lines, Kitco uses YouTube API services to connect the contents of Kitco's YouTube Channel(s) with our Sites and Apps. You can learn more about YouTube's privacy policies at policies.google.com/privacy.

### 6 OPT-OUT PREFERENCE SIGNALS

Our systems generally recognize commercially reasonable opt-out preference signals (e.g., Global Privacy Controls). Recognition of this signal will only occur with respect to the device and/or browser that communicates the signal such that you may need to update your preferences on every device or browser you use to access our Services.

### 7 SECURITY MEASURES

Your safety and security is of utmost importance to us. As such, we enforce the highest security measures when it comes to protecting your Personal Information against theft, loss, and corruption, as well as defending against the misuse and alteration of any customer data stored on our servers.

To keep your credit card information secure, we only use the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliant version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for transferring credit card information across the internet, and all Kitco employees and agents are aware of this security policy. Your Personal Information is accessible only to selected employees and agents who need this information to carry out contractual obligations with you.

However, when you log into your account through a public or other unsecured connection, or if you choose to share your login information with others, we can't guarantee the security of your account. It's best practice to keep your passwords private, so you should avoid sharing this information with others. We do not guarantee that your Personal Information will be secure from theft, loss, or unauthorized access or use, and we make no representation as to the reasonableness, efficacy, or appropriateness of the measures we use to safeguard such Personal Information. In the event of an incident that we are required by law to inform you of, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us as specified in the "Contact Us" section below.

### 8 DATA RETENTION

The time periods for which we retain your Personal Information depend on the purposes for which we use it and applicable law for the type of data and use. Kitco will keep your Personal Information for as long as you are a registered subscriber or user of our Services or for as long as we have a valid business purpose to do so and, thereafter, for no longer than is required or permitted by law. The Personal Information we collect may be stored and processed in servers in Canada, the United States and/or other jurisdictions where Kitco, or our service providers, have facilities.

### 9 CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Kitco does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 14 (or other relevant age of majority) without first obtaining parental consent in accordance with applicable laws. Users under the age of 14 should not submit any Personal Information to us. If you believe we have collected Personal Information from your child in error or have questions or concerns about our practices relating to children, please notify us using the details in the "Contact Us" section below. We will take prompt steps to remove the Personal Information from our systems.

### 10 INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Kitco is headquartered in Canada and we have operations, entities, and Services throughout the world. Your Personal Information may be transferred to a third-party service provider for processing and storage, and may also be stored and processed in countries where we have facilities or service providers. By using our Services, you consent to your Personal Information being transferred to countries outside of Canada, which may have different data protection rules. If your Personal Information is transferred outside of Canada, the governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that jurisdiction may be able to obtain disclosure of your Personal Information through the laws of that jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your Personal Information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

### 11 LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

Our Sites may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may be operated by companies not affiliated with Kitco. Linked websites may have their own privacy policies or notices, which we recommend you review if you visit those websites. This Privacy Policy only applies to Personal Information collected on these Sites. We have no control over third-party websites and are not responsible or liable for the content, privacy practices, or use of any websites that are not affiliated with Kitco.

### 12 YOUR CHOICES RELATING TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Depending on the Services you use and the sensitivity of your information, we may obtain your consent to disclose information in different ways. Express consent may be obtained verbally, online, or in writing, and implied consent may be obtained through your use of our Sites or Apps, or when you approach us to obtain information on Kitco's products and Services.

Generally, we seek consent to collect, use and disclose Personal Information at the same time we collect the information. In some circumstances, we may identify a new purpose and seek your consent to use and disclose Personal Information after it's been collected.

Consent can also be given through an authorized representative, such as a legal guardian or a person with Power of Attorney. This may be necessary if we cannot obtain express consent from a minor (i.e., someone who is under the age of 18), or a person who is seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated.

We will send necessary communication to you and other users of our Services that contains important information, as well as other communication you request from us. You may not opt out from receiving these communications or adjust the media format through which you receive them.

We may occasionally send you marketing content about our Sites, Services, or products, as well as the products and services of unaffiliated third parties through email, text, pop-ups, push notifications and messaging applications. You can opt out of these marketing communications at any time. If you have an account with us, you can also adjust your communication preferences in your account settings or by calling our customer experience team at [1 877-775-4826](tel:+18777754826). For messages sent via push notifications, you can manage your preferences on your device.

### 13 YOUR RIGHTS RELATING TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You may have certain rights regarding your Personal Information. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your Personal Information and the requirements of applicable law (i.e., your rights will vary depending on whether you are located in, for example, California). Specifically, you may have the following rights:

* **Right to access**: You may have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether Personal Information concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the Personal Information. This access to information includes the purposes of the processing, the categories of Personal Information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients of Personal Information, among other categories of information. However, this is not an absolute right, and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the Personal Information free of charge. For further copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.
* **Right to data portability**: You may have the right to request that we transfer the Personal Information we have collected about you to another organization, or directly to you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions.
* **Right to correction**: You may have the right to request that we correct any Personal Information about you that is inaccurate. Depending on the purpose of the processing, you also have the right to request that we complete the Personal Information we hold about you where you believe it is incomplete, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
* **Right to deletion**: You may have the right to request that we erase your Personal Information, under certain conditions.
* **Right to know what Personal Information is sold or shared and to whom, and right to prohibit the sale or sharing of Personal Information**: We do not and have not in the preceding 12 months, sold your Personal Information, nor do we sell the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16 for money. However, we have shared (in this context, “share” means the use of your Personal Information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising) your Personal Information, which may be treated as a “sale” under applicable law. You may opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information by updating your cookie preferences, as described above.
* **Right to opt-out of targeted advertising**: As noted above, we engage in targeted advertising through the use of cookies. You may opt-out of targeted advertising by updating your preferences in the cookie preference center or by contacting us, as stated below.
* **Right to opt-out of profiling**: You may have the right to opt out of the processing of your Personal Information for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. At this time, we do not engage in profiling for purposes that may be opted out of.
* **Right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive Personal Information**: We will only use sensitive Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected. If this changes, we will notify you, and you may have the right to restrict such additional uses.
* **Right to withdraw consent**: Where we rely on your consent to process your Personal Information, such as when we process sensitive Personal Information or record certain interactions between you and Kitco, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal.
* **Right of non-discrimination/retaliation**: We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Policy, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.

Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. Your rights and our responses will vary based on the circumstances of the request. If you choose to assert any of these rights under applicable law, we will respond within the time period prescribed by such law.

Depending on where you are located, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your Personal Information. If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf.

In any circumstances, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

To exercise your rights, please contact us as stated in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.

### 14 CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

To ensure this Privacy Policy stays up to date, we may make changes from time to time without notifying you directly. You'll always be able to see any changes made on our Sites. The revised Privacy Policy will be date stamped with 'Last Updated' at the top and will become effective when posted to our Sites. Using our Sites, Apps, products and Services, and/or providing consent to the updated Privacy Policy following such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
