6) Advertisements for third party products and services where we have determined that such product or service may be of interest to our customers

To ensure compliance with the Can-Spam Act, FifthPerson.com has implemented the following guidelines for email delivery:

1) All emails sent to you by FifthPerson.com will clearly identify FifthPerson.com as the sender. FROM / SENDER: someone@FifthPerson.com (NOTE: The actual sender will alter from department to department, but all from addresses will end with @FifthPerson.com).  
2) The Subject Line of any email you receive will always accurately describe the subject matter of the email.  
3) Any email from FifthPerson.com will include the ability to unsubscribe from future email messages.  
4) Unsubscribing will ensure the customer is removed from ALL lists at FifthPerson.com; this excludes customer service emails regarding the processing and status of a current product.

6) All third party marketing partners are required to comply with the Can-Spam Act.

FifthPerson.com understands consumers’ concerns over the use of their personal information. We hope this information will relieve any concerns your company may have regarding our email policies. FifthPerson.com and its affiliated sites use only an “opt-in or opt out” method of obtaining customer information, and it is not our policy or desire to send unsolicited email. We obtain email addresses and personal information from third parties that follow the same set of policies. FifthPerson.com email messages sent always include information about the origin of the emails and instructions on how recipients can unsubscribe from receiving future email messages.

1) that the data was collected voluntarily from individuals on website registrations and co-registrations,  
2) that the sellers have a right, under any applicable privacy statements, to transfer the data to us, and  
3) that FifthPerson.com has the right to send marketing offers to the individuals.

We hope this information satisfies any questions or concerns you may have regarding the email practices of FifthPerson.com. If you have additional questions or wish to discuss this matter further, please contact us at: contactATfifthpersonDOTcom (Please replace “AT” with @ and “DOT” with .)
