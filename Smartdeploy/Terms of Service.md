Terms of Use
------------

_Last updated: April 12, 2023_

THIS IS A BINDING LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN PDQ.COM CORPORATION, A DELAWARE CORPORATION (TOGETHER WITH ITS AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, COLLECTIVELY, THE “**COMPANY**”) AND YOU, INDIVIDUALLY, AND ON BEHALF OF YOUR EMPLOYER (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**USER**”). USERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“**TERMS OF USE**”) BEFORE ACCESSING AND/OR USING ANY OF THE COMPANY’S WEBSITES, AND THE COMPANY’S OTHER APPLICATIONS AND PLATFORMS, INCLUDING ANY MOBILE APPLICATIONS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**SITES**”), OR (2) ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE SITES (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**SERVICES**”). BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES OR SERVICES, THE USER AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, AND BE LIABLE TO COMPANY FOR ANY NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS OF USE. IF THE USER DOES NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE, AS THESE TERMS OF USE MAY BE MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME, THE USER MAY NOT USE THE SITES OR SERVICES.

These Terms of Use apply to and are incorporated by reference into that, as applicable, Software End User License Agreement and Software-as-a-Service Agreement made by and between the Company and the User (or User’s employer, or other organization or entity that User is an agent, consultant or contractor of, as applicable) (together with any exhibits and attachments thereto and any other related documentation between the parties, collectively, the “**User Agreement**”). To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the applicable User Agreement, the terms of these Terms of Use shall prevail.

#### 1\. Right to Use

Subject to all limitations and restrictions contained herein and the applicable User Agreement, User will have a limited, revocable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right to use the Sites and Services solely for its internal business purposes and to perform the functions described in the applicable User Agreement. User shall not allow any person who is not an Authorized User (defined in Section 7) to frame, syndicate, distribute, replicate, or copy any portion of the Sites or Services. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the applicable User Agreement and not including Authorized Users, User shall not permit any subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or third parties to access or use the Sites or Services.

#### 2\. Use Restrictions

User shall not, and shall not permit any other person or entity to, access or use the Sites or Services except as expressly permitted by these Terms of Use or the applicable User Agreement. For purposes of clarity and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, User shall not, except as these Terms of Use expressly permit: (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works or improvements of the Sites, Services or Intellectual Property (as defined in Section 12(b)); (b) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available any Sites, Services or Intellectual Property to any person, including on or in connection with the internet or any time-sharing, service bureau, software as a service, cloud, or other technology or service; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to the source code of the Sites, Services or Intellectual Property, in whole or in part; (d) bypass or breach any security device or protection used by the Sites, Services or Intellectual Property or access or use the Sites, Services or Intellectual Property other than through the use of his or her own then valid access credentials; (e) input, upload, transmit, or otherwise provide to or through the Sites or Services, any information or materials that are unlawful or injurious, or contain, transmit, or activate any harmful or malicious code; (f) damage, destroy, disrupt, disable, impair, interfere with, or otherwise impede or harm in any manner the Sites, Services, Intellectual Property, or Company’s provision of services to any third party, in whole or in part; (g) remove, delete, alter, or obscure any trademarks, warranties, or disclaimers, or any copyright, trademark, patent, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights notices from any Sites, Services or Intellectual Property, including any copy thereof; (h) access or use the Sites, Services or Intellectual Property in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any right, title, or interest of the Company or other right of any third party (including by any unauthorized access to, misappropriation, use, alteration, destruction, or disclosure of the data of any other customer of the Company), or that violates any applicable law; (j) access or use the Sites or Services for purposes of competitive analysis of the Sites or Services, the development, provision, or use of a competing software service or product or any other purpose that is to the Company’s detriment or commercial disadvantage; (k) access or use the Sites or Services to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, or (l) access or use the Sites or Services for filesharing purposes or otherwise access or use the Sites or Services beyond the scope of the authorization granted under these Terms of Use.

#### 3\. Certain Other Restrictions

In no event will User disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer the Sites, Services, or Intellectual Property (as defined in Section 12(b)) or permit others to do so. Disassembling, decompiling, and reverse engineering include, without limitation: (a) converting the Intellectual Property from a machine-readable form into a human-readable form; (b) disassembling or decompiling the Intellectual Property by using any means or methods to translate machine-dependent or machine-independent object code into the original human-readable source code or any approximation thereof; (c) examining the machine-readable object code that controls the Intellectual Property’s operation and creating the original source code or any approximation thereof by, for example, studying the Intellectual Property’s behavior in response to a variety of inputs; or (d) performing any other activity related to the Intellectual Property that could be construed to be reverse engineering, disassembling, or decompiling.

#### 4\. License to User Data

User hereby grants to Company a royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide, and non-exclusive license to use, upload, display, copy and store all User Data (defined below).

(a) “**User Data**” means information, data, and other content, in any form or medium that is collected, downloaded, or otherwise received, directly or indirectly from User or an Authorized User by or through the Sites or Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer Data does not include any Content (defined below) submitted by User or an Authorized User to the Company, Sites or Services, including: (i) data and information related to User or Authorized User’s use of the Sites and/or Services used by Company, including to compile statistical and performance information related to the provision and operation of the Sites and Services; and (ii) any information reflecting the access or use of the Sites and/or Services by or on behalf of User or any Authorized User.

#### 5\. Submitted Content

The Sites may contain message boards, chat rooms, personal web pages or profiles, forums, bulletin boards or other interactive features that may allow User to submit, post, display, publish or transmit comments, feedback, background information, messages, photographs, videos, suggestions, questions, reviews and any other related content through the Sites and/or the Services (the “**Content**”). By submitting the Content, User represents and warrants that: (x) User is the sole author and owner of the Content; (y) User is at least 18 years of age; and (z) the Content supplied by User or an Authorized User will not violate these Terms of Use, or any applicable law and will not cause any injury to any person or entity.

(a) User also represents and warrant that the Content is NOT, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, any of the following: false, inaccurate, misleading, a violation of any local, state, federal, international or other applicable law, or otherwise obscene, derogatory, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, slanderous, hateful or embarrassing to any other person or entity, including as such relates to the harassment, degradation, intimidation, or victimization of an individual or group of individuals on the basis of religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age or disability; an infringement on the rights of others, such as infringements on any patent, copyright, trademarks, trade secret, publicity or privacy rights; an advertisement, solicitation or spam link to other websites or individuals, except if such an advertisement or solicitation has been expressly consented to in writing by the Company; a chain letter or pyramid scheme, or part of a chain letter or pyramid scheme; an impersonation of, and does not purport to impersonate, another business, person, or entity, including the Company and its employees and agents; or a virus or other harmful computer code, and does not contain a virus or other harmful code.

(b) User expressly agrees that all Content submitted to the Sites and Services will not be considered confidential or proprietary and User automatically grants and/or warrants the Company a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid up, unlimited, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate distribute, perform and display the submission and/or the Content in any media or medium, or any form, format or forum whether now known or hereafter developed. User expressly acknowledges that any Content contributed by User (whether directly or indirectly) may be publicly accessible or viewable.

(c) User further understands and acknowledges that Company has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor all Content and any submission made to or on the Sites or the Services. Company has the right, in its sole discretion and for any reason, to edit, delete, move, or to refuse to post any Content or any other submission to the Sites or the Services. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONTENT AND/OR ANY OTHER SUBMISSION USER OR AN AUTHORIZED USER MAKES TO OR ON THE SITES OR THE SERVICES, AND USER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE COMPANY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO OR ARISING FROM SUCH CONTENT AND/OR SUBMISSIONS.

User hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that User’s eligibility to access and use the Sites and Services shall be contingent on User’s continued compliance with the terms of the applicable User Agreement and these Terms of Use.

#### 7\. Accounts & Passwords

With respect to Users who are parties to a User Agreement (or such agreement for the piloting of the Sites and/or Services), Company will authorize individual employees, consultants, contractors and agents of such Users as designated by such Users from time to time pursuant to the applicable User Agreement (each an “**Authorized User**”).

#### 8\. Third Party Software

The Sites and Services may contain third party software that requires notices and/or additional terms and conditions. Such required third party software notices and/or additional terms and conditions may be requested from Company and are made a part of and incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use. By accepting these Terms of Use, User is also accepting the additional terms and conditions, if any, set forth therein.

#### 9\. Links to Other Websites & Third Party Content

The Sites and Services may contain links to or be linked from other websites and resources located on servers maintained by third parties over which Company has no control (“**Linked Websites**”). The Linked Websites are provided for User’s convenience and information only and, as such, User accesses them at its own risk. User agrees and acknowledges that the Company is not responsible for, and does not endorse or warrant, the content of or anything that may be delivered to User or User’s computer as a result of accessing any Linked Websites, whether or not the Company is affiliated with the owners of such Linked Websites. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, USER SHALL WAIVE ANY CLAIMS RELATED TO, AND THE COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR, USER’S ACCESS OF ANY INFORMATION ON OR USE OF THE LINKED WEBSITES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY VIRUSES OR OTHER ILLICIT CODE THAT MAY BE DOWNLOADED THROUGH A LINKED WEBSITE, OR BY ACCESSING A LINKED WEBSITE.

The information presented on or through the Sites and Services is made available solely for general information purposes and the Company does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Any reliance User places on such information is strictly at User’s own risk. Company disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by the User or any other party who may be informed of any the information contained on the Sites. The Sites include information and content provided by third parties, including the Content and other materials provided by other users, bloggers and third-party licensors, syndicators, aggregators, and/or reporting services (“**Third Party Content**”). ALL STATEMENTS AND/OR OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THE THIRD PARTY CONTENT, AND ALL ARTICLES AND RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS AND OTHER CONTENT, OTHER THAN THE CONTENT AND MATERIALS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY, ARE SOLELY THE OPINIONS AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERSON OR ENTITY PROVIDING SUCH THIRD PARTY CONTENT.

USER EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE GRANTS ANY RIGHT, TITLE, OR INTEREST IN OR TO (INCLUDING ANY LICENSE UNDER) ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN OR RELATING TO, THE SITES, SERVICES, OR ANY MATERIALS PROVIDED BY COMPANY TO USER, WHETHER EXPRESSLY, BY IMPLICATION, ESTOPPEL, OR OTHERWISE. All right, title, and interest in and to the Sites, Services, Intellectual Property and any materials provided by Company to User will remain with the Company (subject to any limitations associated with intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to materials provided by such third parties), even if enhancements or other changes are suggested or requested by User or any Authorized User and become incorporated into the Sites, Services or Intellectual Property.

#### 11\. Marks and Publicity

Company and User trademarks, trade names, service marks, and logos, whether or not registered (“**Marks**”), are the sole and exclusive property of the respective owning party, which owns all right, title and interest therein. Company may: (a) use the User’s name and/or logo within product literature, press release(s), social media, and other marketing materials; (b) quote the User’s statements in one or more press releases; and/or (c) make such other use of the User’s name and/or logo as may be agreed between the parties.

User agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information (defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, User shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without limitation, all precautions the User employs with respect to its confidential materials). User shall limit access to Company’s Confidential Information to those of its employees and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with the applicable User Agreement and these Terms of Use; provided, however, that User shall ensure that its employees and agents who have access to Company’s Confidential Information have signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions of these Terms of Use or are otherwise legally obligated not to disclose such Confidential Information, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees and agents. User shall not make any copies of the Confidential Information except upon the Company’s prior written approval. User shall promptly notify Company if User becomes aware of any use or disclosure of the Confidential Information in violation of these Terms of Use. If User is required by law to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by these Terms of Use, User will provide Company with prompt written notice of such requirement so that Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief. Subject to the foregoing sentence, User may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that User is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however, that User provides such assistance as Company may reasonably request in obtaining such order or other relief. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE CONSTRUED TO CONVEY ANY RIGHT, TITLE OR INTEREST IN AND TO ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY. USER SHALL NOT, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SELL, LEASE, LICENSE, ASSIGN, TRANSFER, OR DISCLOSE THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY AND SHALL NOT COPY, REPRODUCE OR DISTRIBUTE THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED IN THESE TERMS OF USE. USER HEREBY EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT COMPANY SHALL OWN ALL SUGGESTIONS, SOLUTIONS, IMPROVEMENTS, CORRECTIONS, AND OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED BY USER REGARDING THE SITES, SERVICES, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED BY COMPANY TO USER WILL BE OWNED BY COMPANY, AND, IN THE EVENT THAT USER IS DEEMED TO HAVE ANY SUCH RIGHT, TITLE OR INTEREST, USER HEREBY AGREES TO ASSIGN ANY SUCH RIGHTS, TITLE AND INTEREST TO THE COMPANY. NO PROVISION IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM USING IN ANY MANNER OR FOR ANY PURPOSE IT DEEMS NECESSARY, THE KNOW-HOW, TECHNIQUES, OR PROCEDURES ACQUIRED OR USED BY COMPANY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES HEREUNDER.

Privacy Policy
-----------------

**A. INTRODUCTION  
**Welcome to the SmartDeploy Web site. PDQ Corporation (“PDQ”) makes available a variety of resources (collectively the “Services”) through this site. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the following Privacy Policy, which may be revised from time to time in our sole discretion.PDQ is committed to protecting your privacy and to giving you the most powerful and secure online experience. On occasion, we ask you for information about yourself to provide services that you request. This Privacy Policy explains data collection and use in those situations. We encourage you to read the complete Privacy Policy.

**B. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) or allows us to contact you. Personal information collected by the SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled site often is limited to email address, name, company or organization, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a Service. We generally request personal information when you are asked to register before downloading evaluation software, ordering email newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering PDQ products. When you download and install a product, we may ask you to register the software electronically to receive an evaluation license. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any other personal information you may already have given us. This is your personal profile.

**C. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION:  
**We use your personal information for four primary purposes:

1. To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
    
2. To help you find software, Services or information on our site.
    
3. To relieve you from having to provide your personal information more than once.
    
4. To notify you by email about product upgrades, updated information, special offers new Services, and content and marketing materials that are relevant to you
    

You may unsubscribe at any time from such mailings by following the instructions at the bottom of our emails. Except as provided below, PDQ will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law, subpoena, court order or other legal process; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of PDQ and its family of Web sites, and (c) protect the personal safety of users of PDQ, its Web sites, or the public. Sometimes we hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, answering customer questions about products or services, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

**D. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**PDQ has security measures in place to attempt to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information under our control. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Except under conditions explained above, your personal information is never shared outside the company. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States, or any other country where PDQ, its affiliates or agents are located. You are ultimately responsible for the security of your personal information. Please take care when using and storing it. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.

**E. HOW WE USE “COOKIES” AND “WEB BEACONS” AND “APIS”  
**In addition to the personal information that we collect when you register, we also collect anonymous information passively using “cookies” or “Web beacons.” This helps to ensure we are publishing content customers need and want. We do not track individuals’ use of the site. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the site. A cookie will not allow the site to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your Web browser, which in turn helps us deliver products and Services more efficiently, prevent others from using your account, measure statistics such as audience size and traffic patterns and display advertisements. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. Web beacons, also known as clear GIF technology, or action tags, are small images which we may place on Web pages and within Web-based email newsletters which assist in delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a SmartDeploy.com web page, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled web page. We do not use this technology to access your personal information on any site; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about PDQ Web site usage. We do not share tracking information outside of PDQ, and do not allow other companies to place Web beacons on our sites. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled Web site, you still will be able to view the text on the screens. However you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the Service offerings on the site. When registering on the website, we may use APIs to verify your identity. These APIs can collect hardware and software information, such as device and application data and the results of integrity checks, and send that data to the API provider for analysis.

**F. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**The SmartDeploy.com web site, or any other PDQ owned, operated, licensed or controlled site does not publish content that is targeted to children.

**G. CHANGES TO THIS STATEMENT  
**PDQ will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. For material changes to this Policy, PDQ will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the Web site.

**H. CONTACT INFORMATION  
**SmartDeploy welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Policy. [Contact Us](https://smartdeploy.pdq.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
