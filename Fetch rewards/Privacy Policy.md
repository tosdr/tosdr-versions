* Refer a Friend: If your friends sign up using the "refer a friend" referral code that you as your friends' advocate provided, we will let them know that their advocate has received points for the referral, and we will let you know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first receipt.
* Social: If your friends sign up using a referral code inviting them to be your Fetch friend, after that friend enters your referral code, they will be added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends in Fetch Social.
    * If you invite someone to be a friend who is already a Fetch member, we will provide your friend a push notification, which will take them to the Fetch App where they can accept your invitation. If they accept, we will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends.
    * We collect and display in each Fetch Social feed and leaderboard, the user names and profile photos of the friends with whom you directly connect, along with certain Fetch activity information.
    * We collect information about the people, pages, account activity, and groups you are connected to and how you interact with them on our App.

You choose whether to activate your GoodRx Card by making a GoodRx Claim. When you activate your Good Rx Card, we provide your GoodRx Card information, name, and email address to GoodRx to enable you to engage with GoodRx and facilitate your relationship with GoodRx. The [GoodRx Privacy Policy](https://support.goodrx.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005228506-Privacy-Policy) governs your relationship with GoodRx. When you activate your GoodRx Card and make GoodRx Claims, you direct GoodRx to provide Fetch your GoodRx Card Member ID and information relating to your transactions, including the pharmacy name and zip code and amount of savings associated with your GoodRx Claims, so that Fetch can provide you points.

### Geo-Location Services

We may utilize location services on your mobile device to collect and use location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device. We may obtain the physical location of your device by using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi, or other technologies or signals. The physical location is used to provide you with a variety of services such as personalized content and/or advertising. We also use your physical location to inform you of nearby stores where you might be able to purchase promoted products to earn Rewards. We may communicate with you based on your location, and when we do so, we do that through our App's push notifications. We do not use your geo-location as a basis for sending you text or SMS messages. If you do not want to receive push notifications, you can disable that through your Fetch App Settings. We will collect precise real-time geolocation data only if you consent. Once you consent, you may opt out of using location services using your device's functionality to do so, but this may degrade the features and functionality that we can provide. Separate from precise geo-location options, our App \[constantly or when the App is being utilized\] approximates your device location when the App is being utilized solely for fraud detection purposes.
