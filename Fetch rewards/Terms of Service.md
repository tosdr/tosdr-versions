By using our App, website, and/or participating in our Program, you are directing Fetch Rewards to share your personal information you provide us by registering and earning rewards with all our participating brands, regardless of your actual interaction with each.

For a list of our participating brands, which we update from time to time, visit [https://www.fetchrewards.com/brands](https://www.fetchrewards.com/brands). In addition, by uploading receipts, participating in a Challenge or taking a Survey offered by a Partner, you are using Fetch Rewards to intentionally interact with all our participating brands who provide points in our Program. Our participating brands may engage with you, including by sending you emails, and use your personal information according to their respective privacy policies. You understand that Fetch does not control and is not responsible for such engagement or policies.

If you have been previously suspended, removed, or otherwise deactivated from using the Services, you may not create or register another account to use the Services. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Services ("Registration Data"); and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to Fetch Rewards, and to keep it accurate, current and complete. We are not responsible for any loss you suffer as a result of your not keeping your Registration Data current. You may also upload a profile photo for your account. You grant Fetch a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, create derivative works from any photos or materials you provide or upload to us through the App. You agree that any photo you upload as your profile photo:(i) will be owned or licensed by you to be used as your profile photo or as otherwise provide to us and that you have all rights allowing you to use the photo accordingly; (ii) will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others; and/or (iii) will not be offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate. Although we have no obligation to monitor or screen any photos or materials you provide or upload to the App, we reserve the right to remove any photos or materials we deem as inappropriate within our sole discretion and without notice to you.

**4\. Your Account Security.** When you create and register your account with us, you choose a user name and password and may choose another device authentication method. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password and device and to supervise use of your account. You must notify us immediately via the contact information provided below if you suspect any unauthorized use of or access to your account. You will not share or transfer your account or password with or to anyone. We assume that anyone using the Services or transacting through your account is you.

**5\. Inactivity of Your Account.** Your account will be deemed inactive and your Points will expire under the following circumstances: i) if you at any time request to stop participating in the Program as set forth in Section 1 above, or ii) if you either do not earn Points, or do not redeem any Points for a Reward, for a period of ninety (90) days. After sixty (60) days of inactivity, Fetch will provide you thirty (30) days notice by sending an email or text message to the email address or phone number provided in your Registration Data that your account will be considered inactive and your Points will expire. Prior to the effective date for account inactivation and Points expiration, you may prevent your account from becoming inactive and your Points from expiring by doing either of the following: i) logging in to your account and successfully earning Points; or ii) redeeming any of your Points for a Reward. While expired Points cannot be recovered, you may reactivate your inactive Fetch account by logging into your account and earning Points. If you reactivate your account, you agree to all the Terms as then-currently stated.

**POINTS AND REWARDS**

**6\. How to Earn Points.** Fetch’s App allows you to participate in our Program to interact with our participating brands to earn points (“Points”) from them for purchasing qualifying brands, completing special offers (“Offers”), or by completing other activities including taking surveys, entering a referral code, or engaging in any other activity as described in our App or Program. Not all users will qualify to earn points from all participating brands; for experimentation, brand trial, audience targeting, or other reasons, users may not earn points for all brands. Offers may be removed from the App at any time at Fetch’s sole discretion. Only receipts that are scanned showing applicable purchases while the Offer remains in the App will qualify to receive Points. In order to earn points, any receipt you scan must contain a description of the product specific enough to confirm that the purchase was made. When you provide Fetch a receipt, by uploading, linking an account with receipt information, or other means made available by Fetch, you allow Fetch to process the information and identify the details printed on that receipt. If you purchased a product qualifying for Points or a valid Offer according to the terms of that Offer, you are eligible for those Points or that Offer, and the receipt clearly describes a qualifying product, we will provide you Points on behalf of the participating brand in accordance with the Offer. We may not be able to accept or process receipts from some retailers, and so, Points will not be available for submitting those receipts. We do not accept receipts and will not award Points for purchases for transactions that are older than 14 calendar days. Fetch may limit the number of receipts that can be processed by you in a period of time to a maximum quantity, as notified in the Services.

**7\. Points May Be Redeemed for Rewards.** When your Points balance reaches the Minimum Redemption Amount, ("Minimum Redemption Amount" shall mean the minimum value of Points required to redeem any Reward offered in the Services ("Reward"), which is subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of Fetch), you may redeem your Points. Points can only be used in exchange for Rewards and have no other use or value. There is no automatic redemption of Points. No interest is accrued on Points. Points may be redeemed for Rewards at the rate specified in the Services at the time of redemption. Fetch does not guarantee that any particular Reward or Offer will be available on any given product for any specific user at any moment in time. Furthermore, not all Rewards or Offers may be available to all users at all times, and different Rewards or Offers may be available only to certain users. Items for which Rewards are or will be available are subject to change without notice. Fetch reserves the right to change, remove, discontinue or otherwise alter the available Rewards or Offers at any time.

**8\. Redemption Process.** When you make a request to redeem Points for a Reward, you must elect within the App the Reward, which could be a gift card or other product offered as a Reward, you want to receive in exchange for your Points. Once a redemption request is approved and the Redemption Item is authorized by us, your Points balance will be reduced by the number of Points designated to the Redemption Item selected by you. All Redemption Items are non-refundable, and may not be returned or cancelled unless specifically offered to cancel in-app. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or delay of any Redemption Item once you have redeemed your Points. If you have any questions or concerns with the redemption process, you may contact us at [support@fetch.com](mailto:support@fetch.com).

**9\. No Cash Value; Points Cannot Be Transferred.** Fetch Rewards users have no property rights in Points, and Points can only be used as described here. Points have no cash, monetary, or other value, and cannot be redeemed in whole or in part for cash. Your Points balance or any part of it is not transferable, cannot be divided as part of a settlement, legal proceeding or death, and cannot be combined with Points of any other member in the Program. Points may not be brokered, bartered, attached, pledged, gifted, or sold. Expired Points cannot be redeemed, and you must be an active member of the Program in order to redeem Points.

**10\. Receipt Scanning and Item Accuracy.** Receipt scanning technology is not always accurate. If an item is improperly identified, either by product name, size, or price, please consult the appropriate in App process to resolve this inaccuracy. If this does not resolve the issue, please contact our support team. In the Services, the receipt correction processes may not be available for certain receipt types. In addition, you may have a limited period of time, as stated in the App, in which you are allowed to correct your receipt(s). You are responsible for reviewing your scanned receipt to confirm accuracy. Fetch or any other affiliated business, participating brands, and/or retailers are not responsible for any inaccuracies in this process, and resolution through the in-App process and through our support team is your sole remedy.

**OUR DIGITAL RECEIPT PROGRAM**

**11\. Digital Receipt Program Description and Terms.** The Digital Receipt Program (Titled "eReceipts" in the Services) is currently the only way to earn points for online purchases or with the use of digital receipts through our Services. In order to participate in the Digital Receipt Program, you must link your email account(s) or your digital consumer account, such as your Amazon account, where you receive your receipts, to the Fetch App through the in-app process. In so doing, you provide your log-in credentials for that consumer account or email account, and you agree that we act as your agent in accessing relevant receipts through those accounts and processing that receipt information through our Services for you. Accordingly, you authorize Fetch as your agent to access your email account or consumer account, which may include any stores or websites that sell products for which our participating brands award you Points. You represent and agree that in providing any email or consumer account log-in credentials to Fetch that you are an authorized user of that account and that you have the authority to provide Fetch access to that account as your agent. Any information processed from those emails or digital receipts will be used and handled the same as any information you would submit via a paper receipt as set forth in these Terms and our Privacy Policy. Fetch holds your security with the utmost importance and encrypts the information you provide regarding any third-party account.

**REFERRAL PROGRAM**

**12\. Referral Program Description and Terms.** From time to time, and at Fetch's sole discretion, we may offer bonus Points, Points, or other rewards when a new user you choose to refer becomes a user of the Fetch Program (a "Referral Program"). Any such Referral Program shall be subject to the additional terms and conditions set forth in the offer or App. When you participate in a Referral Program, we provide you a link, some pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend. It is within your sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the link, the pre-formatted text, and referral code. You acknowledge that you do not share any of your friend's information with Fetch in connection with a Referral Program, and Fetch itself does not directly send any referral codes to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents from an individual before referring that individual to us in a Referral Program and inform the individual: (a) that we are not the sender or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to the Referral Program; (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any such messages or communications; and (c) that you may be receiving a referral bonus if the individual becomes a new user of Fetch. Current or Inactive former users of the Services cannot qualify as new users for purposes of a Referral Program, and any attempt to create referrals to non-existent individuals or to multiple accounts for the same individual will be void and are in violation of these terms. We reserve the right to void or take any other action we deem appropriate with respect to referrals, including if a referral code is shared in a social media post or from a social media account that contains offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate content. Fetch may discontinue and/or revoke any Referral Program or incentive program in its sole discretion at any time without notice. Fetch Rewards reserves the right to decline to award referral bonuses, rescind bonus Points credited, or take any other action related to a Referral Program.

**13\. Refer a Friend.** When you participate in our "refer a friend" program ("Refer a Friend"), we designate you as an "advocate" with respect to the friend that you refer If you refer a friend to sign up using the Refer a Friend referral code that you provided, we will provide you the Points associated with that particular Refer a Friend offer once your friend successfully scans their first receipt, and we will let your friend know that their advocate has received points for the referral. We will also let you know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first receipt.

**FETCH SOCIAL**

**14**. In our App, Social is a community of Fetch members that you create through friend referrals and invites. If your friend enters your referral code during sign up or elsewhere in app, they will be automatically added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends in Social. You can also invite someone to be a friend on Social who is already a Fetch member, in which case, that invitation would not constitute a referral of a new user. You can search for a friend on Fetch via name, phone number or email address. If we find a match, you can invite that current Fetch member to be a friend on Social by generating a push notification to that friend through our App. The current member can then choose whether to accept your invitation. If they accept, we will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends. If you do not want to participate in Social, simply remove all friend connections.

**15.** By participating in Social, you consent and agree that:

* We will share your name, state, number of friends and mutual friends, profile photo, Points earned, merchants/stores from which receipts were scanned, top brands for which Points were earned, the chosen Rewards for which Points were redeemed, Point-earning activities engaged in, the date on which each activity occurred, information about Social Offers in which you and your friends are participating, and other information, as disclosed to you from time to time (collectively, your "Fetch Social Activity Information") with all those with whom you are directly connected as friends on Social.
* We will post on each of your friends' Social feed and on the Social leaderboard consisting of all your friends, your Fetch Social Activity Information, including the top brands you scanned, which may provide your friends details about specific products you may have purchased. If you do not want your Fetch Social Activity displayed to your friends or on leaderboards, do not participate in Social.
* Your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends, limited information about Point-earning activities you've engaged in, and Fetch Points will be visible to all your friends' friends with whom you are not directly connected ("Friends of Friends"), along with other users with whom you're not connected, but the Friends of Friends and other users will not be able to view any other Fetch Social Activity Information. Friends of Friends, however, may invite you to directly connect as their friend by sending you a push notification as set forth above.
* You may, at any time, disconnect a friend or all friends through the Fetch App. Doing so will remove all your Fetch Social Activity Information from your friend's Social feed and leaderboard.
* Fetch Rewards is not responsible for your interactions with your friends on or as a result of your participation in Social. You have the sole discretion to invite or disconnect friends and to participate in Social.
* You may choose to sync your contacts; this allows Fetch Rewards to identify which of your contacts in your device's address book are also Fetch Rewards users. When you upload your contacts, Fetch Rewards will access the names, phone numbers, and email addresses in your address book. We don't store this information and process it only momentarily to enable us to connect you with your contacts who are also using Fetch Rewards.

**16.** You have the ability to react to and comment on your friend's Fetch Social Activity Information. We are not responsible for any comments posted by you, any of your friends, or Friends of Friends. We may, although we have no obligation to, remove any comments or reactions that we deem in our sole discretion to be inappropriate or offensive. We may remove any content or comments at any time and without notice in our sole discretion in accordance with these Terms of Service or if we believe in our sole discretion that they violate these Terms of Service or any applicable law, regulation, or rights of third parties.

**17\. Social Offers.** From time to time, Fetch may offer you and your friends opportunities to earn Points when you and your friends redeem certain offers that you share or that are shared with the friends in your Social group ("Social Offers"). Friends with whom Social Offers are shared can view a specific friend's completion or response to a Social Offer. You and your friends can also send each other text, email, and/or other messages about certain Social Offers by using pre-formatted text we provide. It is within your and your friends' sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the pre-formatted text about the Social Offer. Fetch itself does not directly send any such communications to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents from an individual before sending any text or email messages and inform the individual: (a) that Fetch is not the sender or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to the Social Offer; and (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any such messages or communications.

**GOODRX PROGRAM**

**18.** GoodRx is a service provided and operated by GoodRx, Inc. that offers individuals certain discounts on prescription drugs. Fetch distributes GoodRx cards through our App, and you can decide whether you want to activate your Fetch assigned GoodRx card (the "GoodRx Card") by using it to claim a discount in connection with the purchase of a prescription drug at participating pharmacies (a "GoodRx Claim"). Fetch does not operate the GoodRx service. The GoodRx service is subject to GoodRx's Terms of Use [\[link\]](https://support.goodrx.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005225563-Terms-of-Use?c=homepage-lander-sem-7&gclid=CjwKCAjw_L6LBhBbEiwA4c46uvNBi1CIr7_G1dI_cGDXJ26km9HgQV7-ydzwD18csudTMXG93F4Z2hoCsFkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and Privacy Policy [\[link\]](https://support.goodrx.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005228506-Privacy-Policy?c=homepage-lander-sem-7&gclid=CjwKCAjw_L6LBhBbEiwA4c46uvNBi1CIr7_G1dI_cGDXJ26km9HgQV7-ydzwD18csudTMXG93F4Z2hoCsFkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). When you make your first GoodRx Claim using your GoodRx Card, you engage with GoodRx and become a GoodRx claimant. Fetch will provide your name and email address to GoodRx to facilitate your relationships with GoodRx.

**19.** Fetch will provide you Points when you make your first GoodRx Claim and when you use your GoodRx Card to make subsequent GoodRx Claims. If GoodRx rejects or reverses any GoodRx Claim, Fetch will deduct any Points already provided in connection with that GoodRx Claim from your account. Fetch is not involved in any way in making any determinations in connection with a GoodRx Claim, including whether to accept or reject a claim or what discounts or benefits to offer. By using a Fetch assigned GoodRx Card to make a GoodRx Claim, you direct GoodRx to disclose your GoodRx Card Member ID and information relating to your transactions to Fetch so that Fetch can provide you Points. The Point value you receive in participating in our GoodRx Program is calculated by and depends on the amount and nature of your GoodRx Claims.

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Fetch, its affiliates, officers, gents, employees, and partners arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Service or your use of the Services other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Service, your violation of the rights of a third party, or any negligent acts, omissions or intentional wrongdoing by you. Any such indemnification shall be conditioned on the indemnified party: (a) notifying you in writing of any such claim, demand, action, cost, liability, loss or threat thereof; (b) cooperating with you in the defense or settlement thereof; and (c) allowing you to control such defense or settlement. The indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in such defense at its own cost and expense. The foregoing Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability and Indemnification provisions shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**39\. User Communications.** You may be able to provide responses, comments, reviews, recommendations, information, or suggestions and submit questions through the Services or through third-party services (collectively, "User-Generated Content"). To the extent you publicly post User-Generated Content, you agree that it will not be harassing or otherwise inappropriate or unrelated to the Services. We are not responsible for the content of User-Generated Content, including its accuracy or quality, but we may monitor the submission of User-Generated Content in our sole discretion. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret third party User-Generated Content, and you hereby release us from any and all liability relating thereto. You are responsible for all your own activity in connection with the Services and User-Generated Content. User-Generated Content will become Fetch's property and may, at Fetch’s sole discretion, be licensed to, transferred to, or shared with any third-party. You hereby relinquish and assign to Fetch the worldwide, royalty free, right, title, and sublicensable license to run, use, re-use, implement, copy, display, transfer, share, and create derivative works from User-Generated Content in whole or in part, in any form (including for commercial, promotional, or marketing purposes) including any opinions, ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained therein for any purpose.

**40\. Linking and Third-Party Websites.** The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Fetch. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Fetch is not responsible or liable for your use of such third-party websites or third-party services. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. Your interactions with third-party organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services (for example, your purchases of goods from your local grocery store), and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.

**41\. Withdrawing from Fetch Rewards; Cessation, Suspension, and Termination.** You are free, at any time, to withdraw from our Program or to stop using the Services by contacting us at [support@fetch.com](mailto:support@fetch.com), or if you stop using the App for 90 days or more, your account will automatically become inactive, as set forth above. Fetch may also terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our sole discretion, including if you violate any of these Terms. Fetch has the sole discretion to determine whether you are in violation of these Terms. Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account, but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Fetch, or for any other reason deemed reasonable by us. Fetch may also stop providing the Services at any time. If we cease providing the Services, we will notify you at the email address you provide in your Registration Data, and if practicable, we will provide you thirty (30) days notice to make a redemption request (subject to our Minimum Redemption Amount of existing gift card requirement described above). If you do not make a redemption request within such thirty (30) day period, your entire Points balance will expire. If you cancel or inactivate your account, any then currently existing Points will automatically expire upon cancellation or inactivation. It is your responsibility to make a redemption request (subject to our Minimum Redemption Amount of Points balance requirement described above) before cancellation or inactivation.

**42\. Assignment.** You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Fetch's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations in our sole discretion.

**43\. Applicable Law and Venue.** Subject to Section 44 below, these Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin, Dane County. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in Wisconsin.

**44\. MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.** You agree that all claims or disputes arising out of the Terms will be decided by an arbitrator through arbitration and not by a judge or jury ("Arbitration Agreement"). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), which are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator's fees and the costs will be shared equally by the parties, unless prohibited by law. Parties are responsible for their own attorneys' fees. The arbitration proceeding will take place in Madison, Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter judgment on the arbitrator's decision and award. The parties agree to bring any claim or dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action, and there will be no right or authority for any claim or dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action ("Class Action Waiver"). Regardless of anything herein and/or the applicable AAA Rules, the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver and/or the arbitrability of a claim or dispute may only be determined by an arbitrator. The following claims are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (a) claims in small claims court; (b) claims to enforce or to prevent the actual or threatened violation of a party's intellectual property rights; (c) claims for temporary relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy; and (d) claims that are non-arbitrable per the applicable federal statute.

**45\. INFORMAL RESOLUTION.** In an attempt to find the quickest and most efficient resolution of our issues, you and we agree to first discuss any issue informally for at least 30 days, except as provided below. To do that, please send your full name, your email and/or mailing address, your concern, and your proposed solution by certified mail to us at:

IF WE DO NOT REACH AN AGREED UPON SOLUTION AFTER OUR DISCUSSIONS FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT EITHER OF US MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 44 ABOVE.

**46.** LIMITED TIME TO BRING A CLAIM. YOU AND WE AGREE TO BEGIN ANY CLAIM AND/OR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.

**47.** WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. YOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and Fetch are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in Section 44 above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

**48\. Taxes.** You agree that you are solely responsible for all applicable federal, state, local or provincial withholding, taxes, and government fees or costs associated with Points or Rewards and any exchanges and distributions.

**49\. Survival.** Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms that relate to any disputes between you and Fetch.

**50\. Severability.** If any provision of the Terms is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Terms shall be unimpaired and shall remain in full force and effect.

**51\. Miscellaneous.** The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Fetch agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Fetch, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). You agree that Fetch has not made, and you have not relied on, any representation by Fetch relating to the Rewards, the Services, or the Fetchrewards.com website, web applications, or mobile application other than those expressly set forth in these Terms. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Fetch in any respect whatsoever. You and Fetch agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
