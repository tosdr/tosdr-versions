By using our App, website, and/or participating in our Program, you are directing Fetch Rewards to share your personal information you provide us by registering and earning rewards with all our participating brands, regardless of your actual interaction with each.

For a list of our participating brands, which we update from time to time, visit [https://www.fetchrewards.com/brands](https://www.fetchrewards.com/brands). In addition, by uploading receipts, participating in a Challenge or taking a Survey offered by a Partner, you are using Fetch Rewards to intentionally interact with all our participating brands who provide points in our Program. Our participating brands may engage with you, including by sending you emails, and use your personal information according to their respective privacy policies.

If you have been previously suspended, removed, or otherwise deactivated from using the Services, you may not create or register another account to use the Services. You agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Services ("Registration Data"); and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to Fetch Rewards, and to keep it accurate, current and complete. We are not responsible for any loss you suffer as a result of your not keeping your Registration Data current. You may also upload a profile photo for your account. You grant Fetch a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, create derivative works from any photos or materials you provide or upload to us through the App. You agree that any photo you upload as your profile photo:(i) will be owned or licensed by you to be used as your profile photo or as otherwise provide to us and that you have all rights allowing you to use the photo accordingly; (ii) will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others; and/or (iii) will not be offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate. Although we have no obligation to monitor or screen any photos or materials you provide or upload to the App, we reserve the right to remove any photos or materials we deem as inappropriate within our sole discretion and without notice to you.

**4\. Your Account Security.** When you create and register your account with us, you choose a user name and password and may choose another device authentication method. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password and device and to supervise use of your account. You must notify us immediately via the contact information provided below if you suspect any unauthorized use of or access to your account. You will not share or transfer your account or password with or to anyone. We assume that anyone using the Services or transacting through your account is you.

**5\. Inactivity of Your Account.** Your account will be deemed inactive and your Points will expire under the following circumstances: i) if you at any time request to stop participating in the Program as set forth in Section 1 above, or ii) if you either do not earn Points, or do not redeem any Points for a Reward, for a period of ninety (90) days. After sixty (60) days of inactivity, Fetch will provide you thirty (30) days notice by sending an email or text message to the email address or phone number provided in your Registration Data that your account will be considered inactive and your Points will expire. Prior to the effective date for account inactivation and Points expiration, you may prevent your account from becoming inactive and your Points from expiring by doing either of the following: i) logging in to your account and successfully earning Points; or ii) redeeming any of your Points for a Reward. While expired Points cannot be recovered, you may reactivate your inactive Fetch account by logging into your account and earning Points. If you reactivate your account, you agree to all the Terms as then-currently stated.

**POINTS AND REWARDS**

**6\. How to Earn Points.** Fetch’s App allows you to participate in our Program to interact with our participating brands to earn points (“Points”) from them for purchasing qualifying brands, completing special offers (“Offers”), or by completing other activities including taking surveys, entering a referral code, or engaging in any other activity as described in our App or Program. Not all users will qualify to earn points from all participating brands; for experimentation, brand trial, audience targeting, or other reasons, users may not earn points for all brands. Offers may be removed from the App at any time at Fetch’s sole discretion. Only receipts that are scanned showing applicable purchases while the Offer remains in the App will qualify to receive Points. In order to earn points, any receipt you scan must contain a description of the product specific enough to confirm that the purchase was made. When you provide Fetch a receipt, by uploading, linking an account with receipt information, or other means made available by Fetch, you allow Fetch to process the information and identify the details printed on that receipt. If you purchased a product qualifying for Points or a valid Offer according to the terms of that Offer, you are eligible for those Points or that Offer, and the receipt clearly describes a qualifying product, we will provide you Points on behalf of the participating brand in accordance with the Offer. We may not be able to accept or process receipts from some retailers, and so, Points will not be available for submitting those receipts. We do not accept receipts and will not award Points for purchases for transactions that are older than 14 calendar days. Fetch may limit the number of receipts that can be processed by you in a period of time to a maximum quantity, as notified in the Services.

**7\. Points May Be Redeemed for Rewards.** When your Points balance reaches the Minimum Redemption Amount, ("Minimum Redemption Amount" shall mean the minimum value of Points required to redeem any Reward offered in the Services ("Reward"), which is subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of Fetch), you may redeem your Points. Points can only be used in exchange for Rewards and have no other use or value. There is no automatic redemption of Points. No interest is accrued on Points. Points may be redeemed for Rewards at the rate specified in the Services at the time of redemption. Fetch does not guarantee that any particular Reward or Offer will be available on any given product for any specific user at any moment in time. Furthermore, not all Rewards or Offers may be available to all users at all times, and different Rewards or Offers may be available only to certain users. Items for which Rewards are or will be available are subject to change without notice. Fetch reserves the right to change, remove, discontinue or otherwise alter the available Rewards or Offers at any time.

**8\. Redemption Process.** When you make a request to redeem Points for a Reward, you must elect within the App the Reward, which could be a gift card or other product offered as a Reward, you want to receive in exchange for your Points. Once a redemption request is approved and the Redemption Item is authorized by us, your Points balance will be reduced by the number of Points designated to the Redemption Item selected by you. All Redemption Items are non-refundable, and may not be returned or cancelled unless specifically offered to cancel in-app. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or delay of any Redemption Item once you have redeemed your Points. If you have any questions or concerns with the redemption process, you may contact us at [support@fetch.com](mailto:support@fetch.com).

**9\. No Cash Value; Points Cannot Be Transferred.** Fetch Rewards users have no property rights in Points, and Points can only be used as described here. Points have no cash, monetary, or other value, and cannot be redeemed in whole or in part for cash. Your Points balance or any part of it is not transferable, cannot be divided as part of a settlement, legal proceeding or death, and cannot be combined with Points of any other member in the Program. Points may not be brokered, bartered, attached, pledged, gifted, or sold. Expired Points cannot be redeemed, and you must be an active member of the Program in order to redeem Points.

**10\. Receipt Scanning and Item Accuracy.** Receipt scanning technology is not always accurate. If an item is improperly identified, either by product name, size, or price, please consult the appropriate in App process to resolve this inaccuracy. If this does not resolve the issue, please contact our support team. In the Services, the receipt correction processes may not be available for certain receipt types. In addition, you may have a limited period of time, as stated in the App, in which you are allowed to correct your receipt(s). You are responsible for reviewing your scanned receipt to confirm accuracy. Fetch or any other affiliated business, participating brands, and/or retailers are not responsible for any inaccuracies in this process, and resolution through the in-App process and through our support team is your sole remedy.

**OUR DIGITAL RECEIPT PROGRAM**

**11\. Digital Receipt Program Description and Terms.** The Digital Receipt Program (Titled "eReceipts" in the Services) is currently the only way to earn points for online purchases or with the use of digital receipts through our Services. In order to participate in the Digital Receipt Program, you must link your email account(s) or your digital consumer account, such as your Amazon account, where you receive your receipts, to the Fetch App through the in-app process. In so doing, you provide your log-in credentials for that consumer account or email account, and you agree that we act as your agent in accessing relevant receipts through those accounts and processing that receipt information through our Services for you. Accordingly, you authorize Fetch as your agent to access your email account or consumer account, which may include any stores or websites that sell products for which our participating brands award you Points. You represent and agree that in providing any email or consumer account log-in credentials to Fetch that you are an authorized user of that account and that you have the authority to provide Fetch access to that account as your agent. Any information processed from those emails or digital receipts will be used and handled the same as any information you would submit via a paper receipt as set forth in these Terms and our Privacy Policy. Fetch holds your security with the utmost importance and encrypts the information you provide regarding any third-party account.

**REFERRAL PROGRAM**

**12\. Referral Program Description and Terms.** From time to time, and at Fetch's sole discretion, we may offer bonus Points, Points, or other rewards when a new user you choose to refer becomes a user of the Fetch Program (a "Referral Program"). Any such Referral Program shall be subject to the additional terms and conditions set forth in the offer or App. When you participate in a Referral Program, we provide you a link, some pre-formatted text relating to Fetch, and a referral code to send your friend. It is within your sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the link, the pre-formatted text, and referral code. You acknowledge that you do not share any of your friend's information with Fetch in connection with a Referral Program, and Fetch itself does not directly send any referral codes to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents from an individual before referring that individual to us in a Referral Program and inform the individual: (a) that we are not the sender or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to the Referral Program; (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any such messages or communications; and (c) that you may be receiving a referral bonus if the individual becomes a new user of Fetch. Current or Inactive former users of the Services cannot qualify as new users for purposes of a Referral Program, and any attempt to create referrals to non-existent individuals or to multiple accounts for the same individual will be void and are in violation of these terms. We reserve the right to void or take any other action we deem appropriate with respect to referrals, including if a referral code is shared in a social media post or from a social media account that contains offensive, harassing, violent, pornographic, or otherwise inappropriate content. Fetch may discontinue and/or revoke any Referral Program or incentive program in its sole discretion at any time without notice. Fetch Rewards reserves the right to decline to award referral bonuses, rescind bonus Points credited, or take any other action related to a Referral Program.

**13\. Refer a Friend.** When you participate in our "refer a friend" program ("Refer a Friend"), we designate you as an "advocate" with respect to the friend that you refer If you refer a friend to sign up using the Refer a Friend referral code that you provided, we will provide you the Points associated with that particular Refer a Friend offer once your friend successfully scans their first receipt, and we will let your friend know that their advocate has received points for the referral. We will also let you know that your friends have signed up and notify you when they scan their first receipt.

**FETCH SOCIAL**

**14**. In our App, Social is a community of Fetch members that you create through friend referrals and invites. If your friend enters your referral code during sign up or elsewhere in app, they will be automatically added to your Fetch friends list and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends in Social. You can also invite someone to be a friend on Social who is already a Fetch member, in which case, that invitation would not constitute a referral of a new user. You can search for a friend on Fetch via name, phone number or email address. If we find a match, you can invite that current Fetch member to be a friend on Social by generating a push notification to that friend through our App. The current member can then choose whether to accept your invitation. If they accept, we will automatically add that friend to your list of Fetch friends and you will be added to that friend's list of Fetch friends. If you do not want to participate in Social, simply remove all friend connections.

**15.** By participating in Social, you consent and agree that:

* We will share your name, state, number of friends and mutual friends, profile photo, Points earned, merchants/stores from which receipts were scanned, top brands for which Points were earned, the chosen Rewards for which Points were redeemed, Point-earning activities engaged in, the date on which each activity occurred, information about Social Offers in which you and your friends are participating, and other information, as disclosed to you from time to time (collectively, your "Fetch Social Activity Information") with all those with whom you are directly connected as friends on Social.
* We will post on each of your friends' Social feed and on the Social leaderboard consisting of all your friends, your Fetch Social Activity Information, including the top brands you scanned, which may provide your friends details about specific products you may have purchased. If you do not want your Fetch Social Activity displayed to your friends or on leaderboards, do not participate in Social.
* Your name, profile picture, state, number of friends and mutual friends, limited information about Point-earning activities you've engaged in, and Fetch Points will be visible to all your friends' friends with whom you are not directly connected ("Friends of Friends"), along with other users with whom you're not connected, but the Friends of Friends and other users will not be able to view any other Fetch Social Activity Information. Friends of Friends, however, may invite you to directly connect as their friend by sending you a push notification as set forth above.
* You may, at any time, disconnect a friend or all friends through the Fetch App. Doing so will remove all your Fetch Social Activity Information from your friend's Social feed and leaderboard.
* Fetch Rewards is not responsible for your interactions with your friends on or as a result of your participation in Social. You have the sole discretion to invite or disconnect friends and to participate in Social.
* You may choose to sync your contacts; this allows Fetch Rewards to identify which of your contacts in your device's address book are also Fetch Rewards users. When you upload your contacts, Fetch Rewards will access the names, phone numbers, and email addresses in your address book. We don't store this information and process it only momentarily to enable us to connect you with your contacts who are also using Fetch Rewards.

**16.** You have the ability to react to and comment on your friend's Fetch Social Activity Information. We are not responsible for any comments posted by you, any of your friends, or Friends of Friends. We may, although we have no obligation to, remove any comments or reactions that we deem in our sole discretion to be inappropriate or offensive. We may remove any content or comments at any time and without notice in our sole discretion in accordance with these Terms of Service or if we believe in our sole discretion that they violate these Terms of Service or any applicable law, regulation, or rights of third parties.

**17\. Social Offers.** From time to time, Fetch may offer you and your friends opportunities to earn Points when you and your friends redeem certain offers that you share or that are shared with the friends in your Social group ("Social Offers"). Friends with whom Social Offers are shared can view a specific friend's completion or response to a Social Offer. You and your friends can also send each other text, email, and/or other messages about certain Social Offers by using pre-formatted text we provide. It is within your and your friends' sole discretion whether, how, and to whom you send the pre-formatted text about the Social Offer. Fetch itself does not directly send any such communications to your friends. You agree that you will obtain all necessary permissions and consents from an individual before sending any text or email messages and inform the individual: (a) that Fetch is not the sender or initiator of any messages or communications that you send to that individual relating to the Social Offer; and (b) that you are not acting as our agent in sending any such messages or communications.

**GOODRX PROGRAM**

**18.** GoodRx is a service provided and operated by GoodRx, Inc. that offers individuals certain discounts on prescription drugs. Fetch distributes GoodRx cards through our App, and you can decide whether you want to activate your Fetch assigned GoodRx card (the "GoodRx Card") by using it to claim a discount in connection with the purchase of a prescription drug at participating pharmacies (a "GoodRx Claim"). Fetch does not operate the GoodRx service. The GoodRx service is subject to GoodRx's Terms of Use [\[link\]](https://support.goodrx.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005225563-Terms-of-Use?c=homepage-lander-sem-7&gclid=CjwKCAjw_L6LBhBbEiwA4c46uvNBi1CIr7_G1dI_cGDXJ26km9HgQV7-ydzwD18csudTMXG93F4Z2hoCsFkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and Privacy Policy [\[link\]](https://support.goodrx.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005228506-Privacy-Policy?c=homepage-lander-sem-7&gclid=CjwKCAjw_L6LBhBbEiwA4c46uvNBi1CIr7_G1dI_cGDXJ26km9HgQV7-ydzwD18csudTMXG93F4Z2hoCsFkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). When you make your first GoodRx Claim using your GoodRx Card, you engage with GoodRx and become a GoodRx claimant. Fetch will provide your name and email address to GoodRx to facilitate your relationships with GoodRx.

**19.** Fetch will provide you Points when you make your first GoodRx Claim and when you use your GoodRx Card to make subsequent GoodRx Claims. If GoodRx rejects or reverses any GoodRx Claim, Fetch will deduct any Points already provided in connection with that GoodRx Claim from your account. Fetch is not involved in any way in making any determinations in connection with a GoodRx Claim, including whether to accept or reject a claim or what discounts or benefits to offer. By using a Fetch assigned GoodRx Card to make a GoodRx Claim, you direct GoodRx to disclose your GoodRx Card Member ID and information relating to your transactions to Fetch so that Fetch can provide you Points. The Point value you receive in participating in our GoodRx Program is calculated by and depends on the amount and nature of your GoodRx Claims.

**SMS TERMS OF SERVICE**

**Fetch Shop and Extension T&Cs**

28. Fetch offers users the opportunity to earn points through purchases made through Fetch on certain third party websites and mobile applications (the “Fetch Shop” program). Your use of Fetch Shop is governed by the general Fetch terms and conditions as well as the following Fetch Shop-specific terms and conditions. To the extent there is any discrepancy or contradiction between the two, these Fetch Shop terms and conditions govern.
29. To use Fetch Shop, you must select opportunities to earn points by qualifying purchases with approved retailers (“Fetch Shop Partners”) through links displayed in the Fetch App. Fetch Shop opportunities are identified as such in the Fetch App; any advertisement or offer that is not expressly identified as a Fetch Shop opportunity does not qualify. Only Fetch Shop purchases made by you through the Fetch App qualify for Fetch Shop rewards. Purchases made without first selecting Fetch Shop opportunities in the Fetch App do not qualify.
30. Fetch Shop rewards are calculated based on qualifying purchase amount minus taxes, fees, and shipping. The specific rate of Fetch Shop rewards earnings will vary depending on the specific Fetch Shop opportunity, and will be displayed in the applicable offer details. The particular details of each Fetch Shop opportunity will be displayed in the Fetch App. Certain conditions, restrictions, and exclusions (“Shop Offer Terms”) may apply, at the discretion of each Fetch Shop Partner. The applicable Shop Offer Terms may be displayed in the Fetch App and/or additional Shop Offer Terms may be displayed on the applicable Fetch Shop Partner’s site or mobile application. Fetch Shop users are subject to all applicable Shop Offer Terms, inclusive of applicable privacy policies, and Fetch disclaims any and all obligations for ensuring a Fetch user is in compliance with those Shop Offer Terms. Failure to abide strictly by Shop Offer Terms may reduce or eliminate any potential Fetch Shop rewards.
31. Fetch Shop rewards are only earned on qualifying purchases that are not subject to subsequent return, exchange, cancellation, or other post-purchase modification (“Purchase Modifications”). Any Purchase Modification that lowers the dollar value of an otherwise qualifying Fetch Shop purchase will reduce or eliminate the Fetch Shop rewards earned by you. To ensure that Purchase Modifications are accounted for, a delay will occur after a qualifying purchase before any rewards points are awarded. This delay is set by each Fetch Shop Partner and will be displayed to you in the Fetch Shop opportunity details. You will receive a notification from Fetch after your completion of a qualifying purchase to advise you of how many points will be awarded at the end of this delay, and subsequently you will receive a notification when the rewards points are added to your account. Fetch does not set the duration of the aforementioned delay and disclaims all liability for the calculation of the qualifying purchase amount. Please contact Fetch support with any questions or concerns about the calculation of the qualifying purchase amount or the duration of the applicable delay.
32. You are responsible for ensuring the items purchased through Fetch Shop are legal where you live and capable of being delivered to your address. Fetch disclaims all responsibility or liability of any kind for any circumstances surrounding your qualifying purchases, including the quality or delivery of the goods or services purchased. Additionally, Fetch Shop opportunities may require creation of an account with a Fetch Shop Partner or downloading an additional mobile application published by the Fetch Shop Partner. Fetch does not control and fully disclaims any responsibility or liability for your use of a Fetch Shop Partner’s site or application.
33. For Shop Extension Users: Use of the Fetch Shop extension enables visibility into opportunities for you to earn Fetch Points through Shop opportunities available on e-commerce sites you visit. As you browse the web, the Fetch Shop extension will (where applicable, and where enabled by you) display offers available to you through Fetch Shop. The Fetch Shop extension is available for the Chrome and Safari browsers, and may be downloaded from the Google Chrome store or Apple App Store, as applicable. You are not required to use the Fetch Shop extension to benefit from Fetch Shop, and the extension may be disabled or uninstalled at any time without penalty to you. You must have a Fetch account to use the Fetch Shop extension.

1. Fetch is not responsible for the content or products available for purchase on those sites, which are owned and operated by third-parties. Matters such as the pricing, fulfillment, shipping, and quality of products, accuracy of the product description or pricing, customer support in relation to your use of those sites, and details of payments for and returns of purchases are between you and the relevant merchant, as Fetch has no control or responsibility for any aspect of your transactions with participating merchants other than rewarding Fetch Points where appropriate. Likewise, you may be subject to additional terms and conditions between you and whichever merchant(s) you purchase from; Fetch disclaims all liability relating to the application of such terms or disputes concerning the same, which are strictly between you and the said merchant. By including a merchant in the Shop program and enabling your access to the same via the Shop extension, Fetch does not thereby endorse the said merchant.
2. Fetch is not responsible for any risks related to your use of any third party site while using the Fetch Shop extension, including any risks arising from malware, adware, cookies, pixels, or other technologies (malicious or not) that may be deployed to your device through your access to another site. Likewise, Fetch does not warrant, and fully disclaims any liability relating to, the performance or functionality of any particular browser or website you use in relation to the Fetch Shop extension.
3. As a condition of your access to the Fetch Shop extension, you hereby fully release and hold harmless Fetch from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party site or service. You further release Fetch, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to any dispute you have with a third-party merchant while using the Shop extension or otherwise using Fetch Shop to receive Fetch points for any particular transaction. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."
4. Fetch reserves the right to disable the Fetch Shop extension at any time, for maintenance or otherwise at its discretion. Fetch disclaims all liability for any damages you may incur (inclusive of loss of any Fetch Shop points you might otherwise obtain) due to Fetch Shop extension unavailability.

**MISCELLANEOUS**

**34\. Unauthorized Activity.** Fetch may take any action in its sole discretion against any activity it deems unauthorized or fraudulent, including deducting some or all of your Points, terminating your account, and taking any other legal or equitable action which may be available to us. Unauthorized activity includes any action that is deceptive or an attempt to gain Points not in accordance with these Terms and includes, but is not limited to, creating fake receipts or accounts, submitting altered receipts, submitting receipts for purchases not made by you for personal, non-commercial use, submitting receipts in any currency other than U.S. dollars and/or buying products and returning them. You may dispute an action that Fetch deems unauthorized by contacting Fetch at account-inquiry@fetch.com within thirty days of Points deduction (or other action) as a result of fraud or unauthorized use. After 30 days, you waive any right to any future claim or to dispute any decision or action by Fetch. Any form of fraudulent or unauthorized activity is a violation of these Terms.

**50\. MANDATORY ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER.** You agree that all claims or disputes arising out of the Terms will be decided by an arbitrator through arbitration and not by a judge or jury ("Arbitration Agreement"). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), which are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator's fees and the costs will be shared equally by the parties, unless prohibited by law. Parties are responsible for their own attorneys' fees. The arbitration proceeding will take place in Madison, Wisconsin, unless otherwise agreed. A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enter judgment on the arbitrator's decision and award. The parties agree to bring any claim or dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action, and there will be no right or authority for any claim or dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action ("Class Action Waiver"). Regardless of anything herein and/or the applicable AAA Rules, the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver and/or the arbitrability of a claim or dispute may only be determined by an arbitrator. The following claims are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (a) claims in small claims court; (b) claims to enforce or to prevent the actual or threatened violation of a party's intellectual property rights; (c) claims for temporary relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy; and (d) claims that are non-arbitrable per the applicable federal statute.

**52.** LIMITED TIME TO BRING A CLAIM. YOU AND WE AGREE TO BEGIN ANY CLAIM AND/OR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER A CLAIM ARISES; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS WAIVED.

**53.** WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. YOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL.

**56\. Severability.** If any provision of the Terms is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Terms shall be unimpaired and shall remain in full force and effect.

**57\. Miscellaneous.** The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Fetch agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Fetch, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein).
