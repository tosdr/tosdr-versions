Flip Terms of Use
=================

Last updated: June 27, 2023 

Thank you for using Flip!   
   
We are pleased to help support your work as you ignite discussion - and use video the way your community does.   
   
Flipgrid, Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, (“Flip,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) provides a collaborative platform on the Flip.com website, the Flip mobile app (“App”), and any associated services (collectively, the “Service”). You accept these terms of use (“Terms”) by creating an account on this Service or by otherwise accessing or using the Service.   
   
We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by providing a notice through our Service or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the updated Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Service after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using our Service. Please read these Terms carefully, including the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver in Section 13, which affects how disputes are resolved. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Service.

### 1\. ELIGIBILITY TO USE THE SERVICE

  
Flip welcomes you to its platform. You may access the Service using your personal email address or an email address provided to you by your organization. Depending on the role you play when using the Service, you may be able to create, manage and share “Topics” and “Groups” for access by different types of Users. Learn more about Topics and Groups [here](https://aka.ms/groupaccess).

There are a number of different roles that you may play as you access the Service, and this may depend in part on whether you access the Service using your personal email address or an email address provided to you by your organization. Your use of the Service must be consistent with the role assigned to the account you use when accessing the Service. For example, if you are using the Service with your personal email address, do not invite any Children to join one of your Groups, even if you are a teacher and they are your students.

**Educator**

An “Educator” initiates and manages Groups and Topics and manages and sets permissions for Student and Guest videos and text within those Group(s) and Topics. Unless prohibited by applicable law, Educators using the Service with an email address provided by their affiliated organization, such as an educational institution or organization or other educational business (a “School”), represent and warrant that they have the legal authority to bind their organization to these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Educators acknowledge that they are always individually bound by these Terms. Educators using the Service with an email address provided by their School agree that their use of the Service may be subject to additional terms between Flip and the relevant organization. Such Educators are referred to as School Educators. School Educators accept Flip’s Terms and Privacy Policy on behalf of their Students. They are also responsible for obtaining parental consent for any Students who are minors in their country. Specific responsibilities of School Educators are described in Section 4 of these Terms. Except as otherwise provided herein, any User who is not a Child or Student, defined below, may use Services as an Educator.

Go [here](https://aka.ms/leadgettingstarted) to learn more about Getting Started as a Educator.

**Co-Lead**

A “Co-Lead” helps Leads manage their Group(s) by adding students, creating, and managing Topic(s), and providing student feedback. Co-Leads do not have the ability to invite other Co-Leads to the Group or delete any user generated content. Co-Leads using the Service with an email address provided by their School are referred to as “School Co-Leads.” 

Go [here](https://aka.ms/leadgettingstarted) to learn more about Getting Started as a Co-Lead. Learn more about Topics and Groups [here](https://aka.ms/groupaccess). 

**Student**

A “Student” is invited to participate in Groups and Topics via a join code provided by an Educator, such as a student invited by his/her School teacher. Students can create and manage their own videos and text within a Group or Topic.

Go [here](https://aka.ms/studentgettingstarted) to learn more about Getting Started as a Student.

**Guest**

A Guest is invited to participate in Topics via a join code and guest password provided by an Educator. Guests can create and manage their own videos and text within a Topic.

Go [here](https://aka.ms/guestpws) to learn more about Getting Started as a Guest.

**User**

As used in these Terms, “User” is any user of the Service, including Educators, Students, and Guests.

If you are a User who is under 18 years old (or the age of legal majority where you live), you may use the Service only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a User under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority where they live), then you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect to that User’s use of the Service.

Further, individuals under the age of 13 or under the age where parental consent is required for use of the Service under applicable law (individually, a “Child” and collectively, “Children”) may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Service, except as permitted below:

* Students of any age, including Students who are Children, may only use the Service at the invitation and under the supervision of a School Educator who has agreed to these Terms and obtained parental consent.
    
* Other Students who are Children may only use the Service after their parent or legal guardian provides consent to us in accordance with applicable law. For more information, please contact us at [Flip Help](https://aka.ms/heretohelp). 
    

No User may use our Service if you have previously been removed or suspended from the Service.

### 2\. PRIVACY

We value the privacy of our Users. Please read our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.flipgrid.com/en-us/about/trust-and-safety/privacy-policy.html) to learn more about what information we collect and how we use, share, and otherwise process that information.

### 3\. ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

**3.1. Account Creation and Deletion.** Only Educators register for an account on our Service. If you register for the Service as an Educator, we will ask you to provide certain information about yourself. You agree not to provide any false, inaccurate, or misleading information when signing up for your account. You must keep this information up to date. You may delete your account at any time and for any reason by following the instructions on the Service and then uninstalling the App. If you have trouble deleting your account, you can also contact us at [Flip Help](https://aka.ms/heretohelp) for assistance.

**3.2. Account Responsibilities.** To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential, as you are responsible for activities that occur under your account. Except as permitted in Section 4, Educators agree not to provide join codes to Students or Guests under the age majority in their jurisdictions.

### 4\. SCHOOL EDUCATORS

**4.1 Responsibilities for School Educators.** School Educators have additional responsibilities to their Students, who may be Children. If you are a School Educator, you agree to the following:

(a) You are responsible for the use of the Service by your Students and shall ensure that each of your Students complies with the Flip Code of Conduct.

(b) You consent to Flip’s collection and use of personal information from your Students, as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.flip.com/privacy.html).

(c) You represent and warrant that you have: (i) the authority to consent to our collection and use of personal information from your Students; (ii) provided privacy notices and obtained consents as required by your School’s policies and applicable law, including but not limited to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”); and (iii) filed evidence of such consents (including verifiable parental consents) with your School administrator before using the Service.

(d) You are solely responsible for responding to requests from parents and Students to review, correct, take down, transfer or update Student personal information or Student User Content in accordance with applicable laws and your School’s policies. You are responsible for notifying Flip if a parent or legal guardian revokes parental consent required to process personal information about a Student.

(e) You represent and warrant that you will use the Service and the personal information collected from Students in connection with the Service in accordance with applicable laws, our [Privacy Policy](https://legal.flip.com/privacy.html), these Terms and your School’s policies.

(f) You may not publicly post Groups or Topics containing User Content provided by or collected from your Students (“Student User Content”). If you invite Guests to participate in your Groups or Topics, you are solely responsible for obtaining any additional consents required to permit Student User Content and Student personal information to be shared with those Guests.

(g) You are responsible for any Student User Content and will respond to any questions from Students or their parents about possession, control, or transfer of Student User Content.

### 5\. YOUR CONTENT

**5.1 User Content.** The Service allows Users to create, post, share and store content, including but not limited to Topics, Prompts, Creations, text, videos, and other material (collectively, “User Content”). Certain features of our Service may offer AI powered generative experiences that allow you to submit text inputs (“Prompts”) to generate content (such generated text content “Creations”), such as the Topic generation feature “Topic Co-Pilot” that allows you to generate Topic suggestions. Due to the nature of our Service, Creations may not be unique across users and the Service may generate the same or similar output for Flip or other users. Other users may also ask similar questions and receive the same, similar or different responses. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, including but not limited to the Code of Conduct in Section 5.4, you may use Creations outside of the Services for any legal, personal, non-commercial purpose. You may not create, post, store or share any User Content that violates these Terms. Except for the license you grant below, and except to the extent that your User Content incorporates any Student User Content as described in Section 4.1(g), you retain all rights in and to your User Content, as between you and Flip. Flip does not claim ownership of Prompts, Creations, User Content, or other content you provide, post, input, or submit to, or receive from the Service (except for Feedback). Except as described in Section 4.1(g), you are solely responsible for any User Content you create, post, share or store through the Service. We use best practices to back up User Content, but we cannot guarantee that User Content will be available in the event it is intentionally or accidentally deleted by another User, so we recommend you backup your User Content regularly.

**5.2 License.** To the extent necessary to provide the Service to you and others and to protect you and the Service, you grant to us a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use, view, download, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools your User Content on the Service. In addition, by using the Service, including Topic Co-Pilot, posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting content you are granting Flip, its affiliated companies and third party partners permission to use the Prompts, Creations, and related content in connection with the operation of its businesses (including, without limitation, all Microsoft Services), including, without limitation, the license rights to: copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate and reformat the Prompts, Creations, and other content you provide; and the right to sublicense such rights to any supplier of the Service. No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your User Content, as provided herein. Flip is under no obligation to post or use any content you may provide, and Flip may remove any content at any time in its sole discretion. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms, you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for your User Content that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Service and that the collection, use, and retention of your User Content will not violate any law or rights of others. With respect to User Content, the above licenses terminate within a commercially reasonable time after your videos are removed or deleted from the Service.

**5.3 Confidentiality.** As Users are able to share User Content outside the Group or Topic to which it was submitted, Flip does not guarantee confidentiality with respect to your User Content.

**5.4 Code of Conduct.**

By using the Service, you are agreeing to follow these rules:

(a) Don’t do anything illegal. Don’t help others break these rules.

(b) Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to harm other individuals, including but not limited to Children.

(e) Don’t engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading (e.g., impersonating someone else, manipulating the Service to increase play count or affecting comments).

(f) Don’t circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Service (e.g., giving false information in order to be able to use the Service, probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Service, systems, or network). 

(g) Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Service, or others (e.g., transmitting viruses, bullying, stalking, posting terrorist content, communicating hate speech, or advocating violence against others).

(h) Don’t infringe upon the rights of others (e.g., unauthorized sharing or use of videos, copyrighted music or other copyrighted material, comments, and/or media, violating the intellectual property rights or privacy of others or collecting or harvesting any information that might identify a person).

(j) Don’t use student information for marketing or advertising purposes.

(k) Don’t invite Children to use the Service unless you are a School Educator inviting a Child as a Student. For clarity, this includes sharing URLs to Groups or Topics with Children.

(l) Don’t use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Service or extract any other User’s information within Flip.

**5.6 Enforcement.** We may (but have no obligation to) review any User Content. Notwithstanding the fact that we have no obligation to monitor the User Content on the Service, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to, at any time for any reason (a) block, delete, limit, restrict access to, remove, or modify your information, including your User Content; and (b) suspend or terminate your account, and refuse any current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof). We will not be liable to you or any third party for taking either of these actions. We may also investigate and/or take appropriate action against you for violating these Terms or for otherwise creating liability for us or any other person, such as by reporting you to law enforcement authorities. If you have questions about an enforcement action, you can submit a case review inquiry at [Flip Help](https://aka.ms/heretohelp).

**5.7 Deletion of User Content.** You may delete your User Content on the Service by following the instructions provided on the Service or in our communications. Students (and their parents, if applicable) can also ask their Educator to correct, edit, or update their Student information and User Content. Students (and their parents, if applicable) can also contact us at [Flip Help](https://aka.ms/heretohelp) to request deletion of your personal information.

### 7\. APP STORES

The availability of the App is dependent on the App Store from which you received the App. These Terms are between you and Flip and not with the App Store. The App Store has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. Flip is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify the App Store, and the App Store may refund the purchase price for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Stores will not have any other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility. We, and not the App Store, are responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to:

(1) product liability claims;

(2) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and

(3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. In the event of any third-party claim that the App infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, we, and not the App Store, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim. You represent and warrant that:

(i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and

(ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You will comply with, and your license to use the App is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies and the usage rules) when using the App. If the App Store terms conflict with these Terms, the more restrictive terms applies. The App Stores and their subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, the App Stores will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you accordingly.

### 8\. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS

We do not control or direct what Users do or say or how they interact with you or each other, and we are not responsible for activity by Users on or off the Service or any User Content they create or share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content). Your interactions with other Users are solely between you and such Users, and we will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions.

MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND OUR AFFILIATES, (COLLECTIVELY, THE “MICROSOFT PARTIES”), MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK OF USING THE SERVICE. THE MICROSOFT PARTIES DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW, WE EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING FOR MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MAY HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS, IF THEY ARE APPLICABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE NOT FAULT-FREE AND OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF DOWNTIME OCCUR. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT CONTENT LOSS WON’T OCCUR, NOR DO WE GUARANTEE ANY CONNECTION TO OR TRANSMISSION FROM THE COMPUTER NETWORKS.

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”

### 9\. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

If you have any basis for recovering damages (including breach of these Terms), you agree that your exclusive remedy is to recover, from the Microsoft Parties, direct damages up to an amount equal to your Service fee for the month during which the loss or breach occurred (or up to $10.00 if the Service is free). You can’t recover any other damages or losses, including direct, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive. These limitations and exclusions apply even if this remedy doesn’t fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if we knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. To the maximum extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything, or any claims related to these Terms, the Service, or the software related to the Service.

### 10\. TERM AND TERMINATION

These Terms will remain in effect while you use the Service. Upon termination, your account will close immediately, and/or your right to access and use the Service will end immediately. Even after your rights under these Terms are terminated, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive, will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, release and binding arbitration and class action waiver.

### 11\. NOTICES

**11.1 Notices of Infringement.** Flip respects the intellectual property of others and asks that Users do the same. If you wish to send a notice of intellectual property infringement, including claims of copyright infringement, please use our procedures for submitting [Notices of Infringement](https://www.microsoft.com/info/cpyrtInfrg.html). ONLY INQUIRIES RELEVANT TO THIS PROCEDURE WILL RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

Flip uses the processes set out in Title 17, United States Code, Section 512 to respond to notices of copyright infringement. In appropriate circumstances, we may also disable or terminate accounts of users of the Service who may be repeat infringers.

**11.2 Copyright Notice.** The Service is copyright © 2018 Microsoft Corporation and/or its affiliates or suppliers. All rights reserved.

### 12\. GENERAL

**12.1 Venue, Choice of Law, and Choice of Language.** Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Service will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Washington, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Washington or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in King County, Washington, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that are heard in court (excluding arbitration and small claims court). The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. The English version of these Terms shall govern, and any proceedings related to actions based on these Terms shall be conducted in English.

**12.2 Export.** The Service may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You shall not export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Flip, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of U.S. export laws or regulations.

**12.3 Disclosures.** If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

**12.4 Miscellaneous.** We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Service. This is the entire agreement between you and us for your use of the Service. It supersedes any prior agreements between you and us regarding your use of the Service. All parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court or arbitrator holds that we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will not change.

### 13\. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. **If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.** Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide, and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. **Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.**

**13.1 Here is what you need to know about arbitration under these Terms:**

(a) Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP. The term “dispute” is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Service, the software related to the Service, the Service’s or software’s price, your account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, **except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.**

Disputes concerning Snap Camera, a lens, or any other Snap-licensed feature or software made available through the Service are covered disputes, and Section 13 applies.

For Section 13, “we,” “our,” and “us” includes Flipgrid, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Snap Inc., and their affiliates. Snap Inc. and its affiliates (“Snap”) are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement to resolve disputes through informal negotiation and arbitration and agree to do everything Flipgrid, Inc. and Microsoft Corporation agree to do in Section 13.

(b) Mail a Notice of Dispute First. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A. (or to Snap at 3000 31st Street, Suite C, Santa Monica, CA 90405, U.S.A.) Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499). We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.

(c) Small Claims Court Option. Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, if you meet the court’s requirements you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business), or (i) King County, Washington, if your dispute is with Flipgrid, Inc. or Microsoft Corporation, or (ii) Los Angeles, California if your dispute is with Snap Inc.

(d) Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Service for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Service, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business), or in (i) King County, Washington if your dispute is with Flipgrid, Inc. or Microsoft Corporation, or (ii) Los Angeles, California if your dispute is with Snap. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim. But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.

(e) Arbitration Fees and Payments.

(i) Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.

(ii) Disputes Involving More than $75,000. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.

(f) Conflict with AAA Rules. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.

(g) Must File Within One Year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see Section 13.1 (a), above) within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it’s permanently barred.

(h) Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to Section 13 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in Section 13.1(b). If you do, the most recent version of Section 13 before the change you rejected will apply.

(i) Severability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 13 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 13 still applies.
