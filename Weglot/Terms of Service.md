4\. Definition and Description
------------------------------

Users have access to the following Services, in the format that Weglot considers most suitable for providing these Services and which are delivered based on the License of the Software mentioned in Article 13 below.

For the purposes of these Terms of Use, the Weglot API, the services providing translation and dissemination of a web application into multiple languages described in Article 4.1, the Professional Translations defined in Article 4.2 as well as the documentation cited in Article 4.4 and, more generally, any development or upgrade to the Software provided by Weglot with the adjoining documentation are collectively referred to using the term « Software ». As a result, the Software includes collectively all and any pieces of software and algorithms as amended from time to time, their successive versions, improvements and upgrades, source codes, preparatory design work leading to the development of such computer programs, technical documentation and preparatory design materials, and which are original and protected by the copyright set forth by article L 112-2 of the “Code de la propriété intellectuelle”.

### 4.1 API

Weglot provides an API that enables a web application (hereinafter referred to as the “Application “) to translate and disseminate this Application into different languages. This includes, but is not limited to, detecting original content (hereinafter « the content ») the translation of this content into one or more languages selected by the Users (hereinafter the « Translations ») from a list of available languages provided on the Website, the hosting of the Translations, and their dissemination to Application users.

Once Weglot is integrated with your Application, your text content is sent to the Weglot API, translated and returned. Your website is then updated with the translations in real time.

Weglot provides a first round of machine translation using APIs from service providers such as Microsoft Translator, among others.

Each time Your users request a language different from your Application’s source language, Weglot receives a translation request. Weglot consults Your dictionary to find all of the requested content and returns the translated phrase. Your dictionary is a table containing all of the original phrases and their translations. Your dictionary is stored on Weglot’s servers. You can access and modify them at any time from the Personal Workspace for Your Weglot Account.

API access can be provided directly or through extensions provided by Weglot on the platforms listed on the Website. They can only work if the Application is connected to the internet. The Users have access to their API key and their Translations from their Personal Workspace, where they can also order and purchase translations from professional translators as described in Article 5.2.

The Users are informed and agree that use of the API requires storage and indexing the Translations on the Weglot platform, including, without being limited to, the Professional Translations.

### 4.2 Description of Subscriptions

Weglot offers several plans based on consumption. The differentiation criteria for the plans are as follows:

* Number of web applications
* Number of translated words
* Number of pageviews (API Calls)
* Number of additional languages
* Support level

  
The number of translated words refers to the number of words translated by Weglot.

The number of additional languages refers to the number of languages other than the web application’s original language. The available languages are listed [on this page.](https://weglot.com/documentation/available-languages)

The number of Web Applications refers to the number of domain names using Weglot.

The support level is “basic” for the Free plan and “premium” for all of the other plans. It defines the processing order, prioritizing premium support over basic support. For all specific requests (outside Services shown on the www.weglot.com website), the User will contact Weglot to provide it with all of the information needed to prepare a quote.

### 4.3 Professional Translation (optional)

All plans described in Article 4.2 include the option for Users to order and purchase translations services from professional translators (“Professional Translations”) selected by Weglot.

In this case, Users order and purchase these Professional Translations on the site from their Personal Workspace. They are then automatically stored and indexed by Weglot, loaded and displayed in their Personal Workspace.

### 4.4 Level of Service

5\. Subscription Conditions
---------------------------

The Services can be accessed in the form of a subscription (hereinafter referred to as the “Subscription”).

The Subscription starts on the day of subscription (after any free trial period), subject to payment for the package as set forth in Article 6, for a period of one (1) month or one (1) year according to the User’s choice, from date to date.

The Subscription is then tacitly renewed for the following (1) month or one (1) year periods based on the frequency selected by the User, from date to date, unless a cancellation request is made by Weglot or the User, and sent in the manner described below.

Users can cancel their Subscription to their Personal Workspace no later than the day before the end of the month for the current Subscription.

Weglot can cancel, without cause, a User’s Subscription at any time by sending the User an email with a minimum notice of one (1) month before the cancellation effective date. The cancellation will be effective at the end of the month or year, according to the frequency selected by the User, at the end of the notice period.

The Client is informed and acknowledged that the Subscription can be cancelled by Weglot with a minimum notice of one (1) week as soon as Weglot can demonstrate the violation of one of the terms of this Terms of Use or the Confidentiality Policy.

The Subscription cancellation is effective after the end of the last month or year of the Subscription, according to the frequency selected by the User, and results in automatic deletion of the User’s account, as well as all of the stored and indexed data.

Any Subscription month or year started, according to the frequency selected by the User, is due in full.

The Subscription reports to a single application, in its web format and on any platform (i.e., for a web Application, the Subscription returns a unique domain name). The User agrees not to use the Services for any application other than that for which the Subscription was originally subscribed.

6\. Financial Conditions
------------------------

### 6.1 Payments

#### 6.1.1 Price

You can Subscribe to the Services and License using various plans. The prices and features of these plans are provided and explained on the Website. The Services and Software are provided and licensed for the prices listed on the Website.

The price for each Subscription is determined based on the number of words translated, additional languages available, web Applications using the service and the support level and billing frequency.

The billing frequency is set by the User and can be annual or monthly. The User can adjust the frequency at any time, which will trigger a payment or credit calculated by Stripe prorated on the remaining time to be billed.

The price does not include the purchase of Professional Translations, which can be ordered and purchased from the User’s Personal Workspace from selected professional translation services.

#### 6.1.2 Changing to a Higher or Lower Subscription Level

The User can change their subscription to a Higher or Lower level at any time from their Personal Workspace.

If a User exceeds the limit of their Weglot Services plan, they will be sent an email notification and then automatically migrated to a higher plan.

There will be a payment or credit for the months or years, depending on the frequency selected by the User, of the Subscription that was partially increased or decreased.

### 6.2 Price of Professional Translation

The User can order and purchase Professional Translation from selected professional translation services from their Personal Workspace. The price paid is based on the number of words to be translated. If the User purchases professional translations, they must also agree to the Terms of Use of the translation partner, as follows: https://fr.textmaster.com/conditions-generales-utilisation-client.

### 6.3 Price Adjustment – Reduction

Weglot reserves the right to modify its price and payment policy for all Services provided without the need to notify its Users.

Once effective, the new prices are applicable from the Subscription renewal date.

Users who do not agree to the new prices must cancel their Subscription using the procedures listed in Article 6. Users who continue to use the Services after the new prices have become effective will be considered to have accepted them.

Any decision involving a discount, reduction or application of lower rates, based on a percentage or package (per word, page, line, or hour), will remain at Weglot’s sole discretion, and only for the service in question. No discount or rebate granted to the Client will, in any event, give rise to a vested right to later services.

### 6.4 Payment Terms

Payments for Subscriptions and Professional Translations are made by credit card or automatic withdrawal.

The bank card debit or automatic withdrawal is managed by Stripe, a secure payment service provider, in which Weglot has entrusted the storage of its User’s banking data.

When paying by bank card, the Website uses Stripe’s security system. Stripe is a provider that specializes in secure online payments. This system guarantees their banking information is completely confidential. Bank translations using credit cards, performed between the User and the secure system are thereby fully encrypted and protected. This means that information related to the Order and the bank card number do not travel over the internet. Weglot does not store the User’s banking information.

We are not a banking institution in any way and all of the intermediary payment services are performed by our partner, Stripe, which is qualified and specializes in these services. Accordingly, we invite you to become familiar with their Terms of Sale, which can be accessed from https://www.stripe.com. As a result, it is your responsibility to verify that our Services are suitable to your needs.

The Subscription will be due and payable in advance each month or year, according to the frequency selected by the User, starting on the registration date or the date corresponding to the first paid Subscription

The price for Professional Translation will be due and payable at the time the Professional Services are purchased.

The user agrees not to hold Weglot liable or challenge the payment corresponding to the provision of Services.

The User ensures Weglot has all of the necessary authorizations to use the selected payment method.

### 6.5 Payment Delays and Incidents

The Users are hereby notified, and agree without reservation that any payment delay of all or part of the amount due under this agreement, will automatically and without prejudice result in the penalties listed in Article 11 and without prior formal notice:

i. Confiscation on the due date of all amounts payable by the User in question, which will become due automatically,  
ii. Immediate suspension of current Services until the User has paid all amounts due,    
iii. Late penalties calculated at an interest rate equal to one and a half (1.5) times the statutory interest rate per day late on the amount including taxes of the price corresponding to the subscription selected will be lawfully and automatically paid to Weglot, without formalities or prior notice and will result in all amounts owed to Weglot by the User becoming due immediately, without prejudice to any other proceedings that Weglot would have the right to undertake against the User for this reason. The User who is in a late payment situation will, as of right, owe Weglot a fixed rate of €40 for collection costs.

– Refund requests will only be accepted in the fifteen (15) following the subscription date  
– Refunds do not apply to renewals or plan upgrades.

### 6.7 Right of Withdrawal Exclusion

Therefore they can not result in an exchange, refund or exercise of the right of withdrawal. Note that, in accordance with articles L. 121-20-2 and L. 121-20-4 of the Consumer Code the fourteen day right of withdrawal does not apply to Services such as those offered by Weglot once implementation has started with the consumer’s agreement before the expiration of the withdrawal period (order accepted and executed).
