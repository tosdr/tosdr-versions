### 1\. You are a client or user of our services (or the representative of one of our clients)

#### a. Login to weglot.com

When you connect to the weglot.com site, a certain amount of data is automatically collected by the site host concerning your terminal (computer, smartphone, tablet) and your browser. This includes your IP address.

This data is collected in order to ensure the connection between your terminal and the site’s servers, as well as later to detect bugs and cyber-attack attempts.

The collection and processing of this data is thus justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in providing a site that is functional, secure and adapted to the different types of terminals and browsers available on the market, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### b. Cookies for audience measurement

The weglot.com website uses audience measurement cookies (Google Analytics cookies). These cookies collect data relating to your navigation, such as the pages visited, the contents consulted or the duration of navigation.

This data is aggregated and used to understand the preferences of our users in order to improve the presentation and content of the site. This use is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in improving its site and its content, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### c. Cookies allowing the correction of bugs encountered on the platform

The weglot.com site also uses, with your authorisation (which is requested when you register for the service) cookies allowing the reproduction and correction of bugs encountered on the dashboard. These cookies are only used on the dashboard.weglot.com sub-domain.

These cookies collect data relating to your navigation, allowing to visually reproduce the moment of your navigation when the bug occurred. This data may also be used to analyse the browsing preferences of our users and evolve the site on that basis.

This data is thus used for the purpose of reproducing, analysing and correcting bugs encountered by users on the site. Their collection and use are justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in improving its site, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

[**Change my cookie preferences**](http://javascript:openAxeptioCookies())

#### d. Customer management

In order to ensure the proper follow-up of our customer relationship, and to manage the various aspects of this relationship (including billing), we collect a certain amount of information about our contacts (customers or customer representatives), such as their full name, e-mail address, business mailing address and telephone number. We also keep a copy of written exchanges with these interlocutors.

All such data is retained for the duration of the customer relationship and thereafter for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management as described under point 6 below.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in ensuring the management of its customer relations, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### e. Sales and technical support

When you ask us to resolve a business or technical issue, we collect certain information related to the Support Ticket, such as the full name and email address of the ticket issuer, the date and time of the ticket, and the circumstances of the reported issue.

This data is retained until the problem is resolved, and then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management described in point 6 below.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in offering technical and commercial support to its clients, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### f. Accounting management

Information relating to our clients and our clients’ representatives may appear in various documents (invoices, etc.) that we keep for accounting management purposes.

The conservation of these documents, and consequently, the data they include, is ensured by WEGLOT for 10 years from the end of the fiscal year in question, in accordance with our legal obligations in this matter.

This data processing is thus justified by legal obligations incumbent on WEGLOT, in accordance with article 6.1.c) of the GDPR.

#### g. Improving our products and services

We use data related to the use of our translation services to evolve these products and services to make them more effective for our customers.

The data processed for this purpose includes user navigation data on our services, as well as content provided by our customers to be translated via our services.

We keep this data only for the time necessary for the analysis that allows us to identify ways to improve our services.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in developing and improving its products and services, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### h. Updates on Weglot Sub-Processors

We collect your email address to inform you of any change on Weglot’s Sub-Processors list, which you can access here [https://trust.weglot.com/](https://trust.weglot.com/).

This data is retained for the duration of the customer relationship.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s compliance with a legal obligation to inform the customer on any change regarding the sub-processors list, in accordance with article 6.1.c) of the GDPR.

#### i. Tracking Adwords Campaign Conversions

We use Google's conversion tracking service for our Adwords campaigns, which allows us to determine the percentage of our customers who discovered us through the Adwords service.

The data collected includes your email, which is sent to Google in a hashed form. In other words, we do not send any personally identifiable data to Google as part of this process.

However, since this processing may be justified for marketing purposes and in accordance with the CNIL's guidelines on hashing techniques, this data processing is subject to your consent as governed by GDPR 6.1.a).

### 2\. You are a candidate for a position at WEGLOT

If you apply for a position at WEGLOT, and send us information about yourself (resume, cover letter, letter of recommendation, etc.), we will use this information for the time necessary to process your application.

This data processing is justified by its necessity for pre-contractual measures implemented at your request, in accordance with article 6.1.b) of the GDPR.

We are also likely, in case of refusal of your application, to keep the related information (application file) for 2 years, in order to contact you again (if we consider it relevant) to offer you other positions.

This retention of your data is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in ensuring its long-term recruitment, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR. In accordance with the recommendations of the CNIL in this matter, we will give you the possibility to refuse this long-term retention in case of rejection of your application.

### 3\. You are one of our suppliers or providers (or the representative of one of our suppliers or providers)

#### a. Business Relationship Management

In order to manage our relationships with our suppliers and service providers, it is necessary for us to collect a certain amount of information relating to our contacts at these suppliers and service providers. This data consists mainly of the surname, first name, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number of the said interlocutors; we also keep a record of our written exchanges with the latter.

All such data shall be retained for the duration of our business relationship with the respective supplier/service provider and thereafter for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of dispute management as described under point 6 below.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in ensuring the proper management of its commercial relations with its suppliers and service providers, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### b. Accounting management

In addition, information relating to our suppliers/providers and the representatives of our suppliers/providers may appear in various documents (invoices, etc.) that we keep for accounting purposes.

The conservation of these documents, and consequently, the data they include, is ensured by WEGLOT for 10 years from the end of the fiscal year in question, in accordance with our legal obligations in this matter.

This data processing is thus justified by legal obligations incumbent on WEGLOT, in accordance with article 6.1.c) of the GDPR.

### 4\. You are a potential customer of our services (prospecting and advertising)

#### a. Newsletter

To subscribe to our newsletter, we need to collect your email address. This will be used for the sole purpose of sending you the newsletter for the duration of your subscription.

This processing of your e-mail address is based on your consent (article 6.1.a) of the GDPR), expressed through your subscription to the newsletter; you may withdraw this consent at any time.

We will also stop sending you the newsletter if you stop opening this newsletter for 3 consecutive years.

#### b. Campaign adwords

We set up adwords advertising campaigns on different search engines to promote our products and services.

These campaigns involve the collection and processing of certain navigation data by the publishers of the search engines in question, including your user agent and the terms of the query you have formulated in the search engine.

This data is used to display the WEGLOT advertising links corresponding to your request, and to edit adwords campaign performance statistics, which is the only information we access.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in promoting its products and services, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### c. Targeted advertising and retargeting

In addition, we use targeted advertising and retargeting services provided by advertising agencies on various sites and social networks (such as Facebook Ads or LinkedIn Ads) to promote our products and services.

These targeted advertising and retargeting services involve the processing of personal data about you, such as navigational data to establish your “profile” and to present you with advertisements adapted to this profile, as well as information about your behaviour with respect to these advertisements (views, clicks, etc.).

WEGLOT never accesses this profile data, but only the advertising campaign reports established by the advertising agencies concerned and containing aggregated information (total number of views, total number of clicks, etc.).

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in promoting its products and services, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

#### d. Prospecting by email (B2B)

We may collect business email addresses accessible on the web through various tools and databases, for the purpose of promoting our B2B services through the sending of emails.

The collection of these professional email addresses and their use in the context of B2B email prospecting is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in promoting its services to a professional public, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

We will stop using your address for this purpose if you object, and in any case if we remain without contact from you for 3 consecutive years.

#### e. Affiliate Program

We have set up an affiliate program, through which publishers of sites and applications can commit to advertise our services on their sites and applications.

The operation of this program implies that we are able to identify new customers who come to us through these business links.

To do this, we use an affiliate cookie, which is placed on your device when you click on an advertisement for WEGLOT services on a partner site or application. This cookie is kept on your terminal for 60 days to allow us to identify you if you subscribe to our services during this 60-day period. The data collected via the affiliate cookie is also deleted after 60 days.

We have a binding agreement in place with our various business contributors to the affiliate program to ensure that the affiliate cookie is not deposited without your prior consent.

> **Important**: With regard to this processing of your data in connection with the affiliate system, WEGLOT shares responsibility with the business contributor on whose site or application the advertisement on which you clicked is located. Nevertheless, in order to facilitate the exercising of your rights, WEGLOT is designated as your contact for any questions or requests relating to this processing, which you may address to us as explained in the section below entitled “What rights do you have to control the processing of your data? ».

### 5\. You are one of our business contributors (affiliation contract)

If you join the affiliate program presented on weglot.com, we will collect a certain amount of data about you, such as your first name, last name and email address. We will also keep a copy of our written exchanges.

This data will be used for the conclusion of the affiliation contract with you, and the follow-up of its execution. They will be retained for the duration of our business relationship and thereafter for the applicable statute of limitations as described in Section 6 below.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in promoting its services and managing its affiliation program, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

### 6\. You are involved in a dispute (actual or potential) with WEGLOT

We may retain any data that we deem necessary or useful to prevent a dispute and to manage any litigation or pre-litigation.

We will use it, as appropriate, to prevent, initiate or respond to any such dispute, whether or not you are a party to that dispute (for example, a commercial dispute relating to the use of our services).

This conservation is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in protecting and defending its rights and interests, including in court, in accordance with Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

In this way, we will retain all data relevant to evidence for the duration of the legally applicable statute of limitations, i.e. in principle 5 years (civil statute of limitations under ordinary law).

### 7\. You are in contact with WEGLOT for a reason other than the above.

We are likely to exchange with you for various reasons that do not fall within the scope of the above categories, for example in the context of financial transactions, institutional exchanges or grant applications.

In these cases, we collect identifying data such as your first name, last name, e-mail address, postal address and/or telephone number, and we keep a copy of our written exchanges.

This data is collected and stored for the purposes of monitoring our relationship, until the end of it, and then for the legally applicable prescription period for the evidentiary purposes described in point 6 above.

This data processing is justified by WEGLOT’s legitimate interest in ensuring the follow-up of its business relations and institutional contacts, in accordance with article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

Who has access to your data? With whom are they shared?
-------------------------------------------------------

Your data is hosted by a secure professional service provider on servers located in the European Union. WEGLOT’s teams and employees are likely to have access to it within the framework and limits of their functions.

Some of your data may also be accessed or at least hosted by the following people and organisations:

* The technical service providers assisting WEGLOT for the maintenance and development of the weglot.com website and its translation services;
* The service providers publish audience measurement cookies and cookies to correct bugs;
* WEGLOT’s legal advisers, accountancy firms and lawyers;
* Payment service providers and banks used by WEGLOT;
* Website publishers and advertising agencies for the purposes of targeted advertising, retargeting and marketing conversion tracking.

These service providers are all located in the European Union or the United States. Those located in the United States have formally adhered to the principles of the Data Privacy Framework and are included in the Data Privacy Framework List (available [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search)), a mechanism to ensure that the transfer of your data to that country is compliant with the GDPR.

If, by way of exception, a person, entity or organisation accesses personal data concerning you in the context of the processing operations covered by this Policy from a country other than the Member States of the European Union (and apart from the specific case of the above mentioned Data Privacy Framework, governed by the European Commission's adequacy decision of July 10, 2023), this transfer of your data will be governed by an appropriate mechanism such as contractual clauses adopted or approved by the European Commission or a European supervisory authority.

What rights do you have to control the processing of your own data?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You have, in the same way as any other person whose personal data we collect and process, a number of rights provided for in the regulations.

You will find the details below. A summary table is also provided below.

You can exercise these rights simply by writing directly to the following e-mail address: [\[email protected\]](https://weglot.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Remember to indicate in your email the nature of the right you wish to exercise and the reasons that justify, if necessary, your request to exercise this right.

### 1\. Right of access

You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, in an easily understandable format, as well as a copy of this policy on a durable medium.

### 2\. Right of rectification

You have the right to ask us to correct, complete or update the data we have in our possession about you, in the event that they appear to you to be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.

In this case, we would be grateful if you would spontaneously communicate to us, as far as possible, the new information necessary to carry out the requested correction, completion or update.

### 3\. Right to withdraw consent

In the case of processing based on your consent (newsletter registration), you can withdraw this consent at any time without justification. Withdrawal of your consent will result in the cessation of the treatment of your data going forward (cessation of the sending of newsletters).

### 4\. Right of opposition

With regard to the data processing listed above, which is justified by the legitimate interests of WEGLOT, you have the right to oppose it for reasons relating to your particular situation.

In other words, you can ask WEGLOT to stop any of these processes relating to you, stating the specific reasons that justify this request from your point of view.

However, WEGLOT may refuse to comply with your request if further processing is necessary for compelling reasons from our point of view (e.g. if the data concerned is necessary for the protection and defence of WEGLOT’s rights in court).

Opposition (if it is based on valid reasons and no compelling reasons oppose it) will lead to the cessation of processing for the future, but not necessarily to the destruction of the data concerned: in order to obtain this destruction, you must exercise your right of deletion under the conditions described below, it being specified that the latter is subject to limitations relating, for example, once again, to the need to keep the data for the protection and defence of WEGLOT’s interests in court.

### 5\. Right to erasure

You can ask us to delete all or part of the data we hold about you, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:

* You have withdrawn your consent in accordance with point 3 above, and this data is not processed for any other purpose than that for which you withdrew your consent;
* You have objected to the continuation of this processing in accordance with point 4 above, and furthermore wish WEGLOT to proceed with the destruction of the data concerned.
* The data concerned no longer appear to be necessary for any of the purposes set out above.
* You consider that WEGLOT has collected and/or processed the data concerned in a manner contrary to the law.
* The deletion of the data concerned is imposed as a legal obligation.
* The data concerned relates to a person who was under fifteen (15) years of age at the time of collection of the data.

Please be aware, however, that WEGLOT is entitled to object to the deletion of certain data when their retention is necessary for particularly important reasons, such as the protection and defence of its interests in court.

You should also be aware that, instead of deleting your data, we may choose to completely and irreversibly anonymise it. In this way, we will be entitled to store this data in a format that no longer allows you to be identified (e.g. for statistical purposes).

### 6\. Right to limitation of processing

If, for example, you do not exercise your right of deletion, you can also ask WEGLOT to “set aside” certain data concerning you, i.e. to keep these data separately, without using them any more (except for legal obligations).

You may make such an application if at least one of the following conditions is met:

* The data concerned appear to you to be inaccurate, and you would prefer that WEGLOT stop using them for the time it takes to check and rectify them if necessary.
* You have exercised your right of opposition in accordance with point 4 above, and you prefer that WEGLOT stops using the data concerned while the validity of your opposition is being verified.
* You consider that WEGLOT has collected and/or processed the data concerned in a manner contrary to the law, but nevertheless prefer that we retain the data rather than delete it.
* The data concerned is no longer necessary for any of the purposes set out above, but you wish WEGLOT to keep it nevertheless for the purposes of defending your interests in court.

In such cases, we will “quarantine” the data for the necessary period of time, e.g. by means of a marking “Do not use – Right to limitation”.

### 7\. Right to data portability

You can ask us to send you a copy of the data collected on the basis of your consent, allowing it to be re-used by you or another service provider.

This “right of portability” differs from the right of access in that its purpose is not to obtain a copy that is necessarily readable by you, but rather a reusable copy of the data, in particular with a view to a change of service provider.

### 8\. Right to set guidelines on the fate of your data after your death

Finally, you have the right to tell us how you would like us to handle your data in the unfortunate event of your death.

In particular, you can ask us to destroy all of your data (subject to any compelling conservation needs we may have, for example to defend WEGLOT’s rights in court), or to transmit a copy of all such data to a person of your choice.

You may also designate any person of your choice to be responsible for the execution of these “last wishes”; this person does not necessarily have to be one of your heirs or even the executor in charge of your estate.

Clearly indicate the persons responsible for following up on the proper execution of your instructions, who will be our contacts after your death.

**Do you consider that we have not responded satisfactorily to your request, or that we are processing your data unlawfully?**

Of course, we invite you first of all to get in touch with WEGLOT, so that we can discuss the problem together and try to solve it together in the best possible way. If you wish, however, you have the right to refer the matter to the competent authority for data protection in France, namely the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), via its website cnil.fr or by post at the following address: CNIL – 3, place de Fontenoy – TSA 80715 – 75334 PARIS CEDEX 07.This right may be exercised at any time and at no cost to you, apart from the cost of sending postal mail if necessary, and any costs of assistance or representation if you choose to be assisted in this procedure by a third party.
