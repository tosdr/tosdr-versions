This information typically may include, first and last name, title, employer, and contact information (email and phone number) and may be used for the purposes set out in the “How We May Use Your Personal Data” section below. In addition, we record chat conversations to allow us to provide the most appropriate responses to your requests. Responses range from setting up demos to simply calling you back.

To assist us in responding to your request, please give full details of the issue. We attempt to review and respond to all complaints within a reasonable time and, in any event, within the legal time limit for responding, where applicable.  

**a. Your Choices**

i) Cookies and similar technologies. As noted above, we collect some Personal Data via cookies and other similar technologies.  

In certain jurisdictions, you can exercise your choice regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies via the Cookie Consent tool displayed at the bottom of our Website. You may also be able to disable cookies via your browser settings or be notified of certain types of cookies placed on your device. Please consult the “Help” menu of your browser for more information. Certain cookies are “essential” or “strictly necessary” and may not be disabled. Note that without certain cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Website, apps or online services.  

ii) Analytics  

We and our vendors use certain automated analytics tools (including cookies and other technologies operated by third parties) to track and evaluate usage of our Website. We use these tools to understand your interactions with the Website and to help us improve our Website, such as by improving our performance and your user experience. We may combine analytics information, including Personal Data, with other Personal Data we collect, and we may provide the third-party analytics providers with Personal Data about you.  

To opt out of Google Analytics in a particular browser, you may be able to install a [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) in that browser. We recommend using the Cookie Consent tool at the bottom of our Website to adjust third-party analytics cookies generally. If you clear your cookies after doing that, use a browser that automatically clears cookies, or access the Website from a different device or browser, you will need to set your preferences again.  

iii) Tailored advertising.  

We may use third parties (such as ad networks and providers of advertising services) to serve online ads that are more relevant and tailored to you based on information that we and these third parties have collected on our Website and about your online activities over time and across other websites. We and these third parties may use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information, including Personal Data, that is used to inform, optimize, and serve online ads and to understand the effectiveness of these advertising activities.  We also allow other unaffiliated parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored advertising to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Website.  

To learn more about tailored advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored ads, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative's (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance's (“DAA”) Consumer Opt-Out Link](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) to opt-out of tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the [Google Ads Settings page](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). Please note that you may still see ads about us and our Services even if you opt out of tailored advertising, but such ads may not be tailored to your interests. We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms or any choices you make using them. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out pages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective.  

iii) Marketing communications.  

You may opt out of marketing emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link within the marketing emails you receive from us or by contacting us as indicated [below](#How-to-Contact-Us).

iv) “Do Not Track” (“DNT”).  

DNT is a setting that users can enable in certain web browsers. DNT signals do not have a commonly agreed upon meaning and we do not currently recognize or respond to DNT signals. DNT is different from any automated opt-out signals mentioned in state-specific sections of this Privacy Notice.  

How We Protect Your Personal Data

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession.  

We also take measures to delete your Personal Data or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we processed it or when you request deletion (subject to limitations and restrictions on this right), unless we are required by law to keep the information for a longer period. We complete periodic reviews of our databases, taking into account the type of data collected, the type of services provided, and the length of the customer relationship, possible re-enrollment with the Services, mandatory retention periods, regulatory requirements and the statute of limitations.

You may contact us as specified in the “[How to Contact Us](#How-to-Contact-Us)” section below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland.

Own’s products and services are not directed to or intended for children.  

Own does not offer services to minors and does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If you believe we have collected Personal Data from your child in error, please notify us using our contact details in the “[How to Contact Us](#How-to-Contact-Us)” section below  

Data Privacy Framework Principles  

------------------------------------

Own complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Own has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Own has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).  

In compliance with the DPF Principles, Own commits to:  

a) resolve questions or complaints about our collection or use of your personal information under the Data Privacy Frameworks by following the Dispute Resolution process set out [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TTA3AAO&status=Active);  

b) cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved DPF complaints concerning data transferred from the EU, the UK and Switzerland;  

c) submit to binding arbitration before the EU-U.S. DPF, UK-U.S. DPF or Swiss-U.S. DPF Panel (as applicable) if this option has been invoked by you, as is your right under certain circumstances;  

d) cooperate with the DPAs, the ICO and FDPIC and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU, the UK and Switzerland in the context of any applicable employment relationship; and  

e) accept responsibility (including any potential liability) for onward transfers of personal data to third parties.  

In addition, it is important for you to be aware that, with respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, Own is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation.  

For the sake of clarity, the U.S. entity of Own adhering to the DPF Principles is the entity identified in the “[How to Contact Us](#How-to-Contact-Us)” section below.  

Supplemental Notice for California Residents  

-----------------------------------------------

This Supplemental Notice for California Residents applies solely to residents of California regarding their “Personal Information” as defined in the California Consumer.  

Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”). This Supplemental Notice for California Residents supplements the Privacy Notice above. This section does not apply to information collected about our employees, former employees, candidates, or independent contractors.  

**a. How We Collect, Use, and Disclose Personal Information**

We collect Personal Information as described in the “[Personal Data We May Collect](#Personal-Data-We-May-Collect)” section of the Privacy Notice, and we use such Personal Information for the purposes set forth in the “[How We May Use Personal Data](#How-We-May-Use-Your-Personal-Data)” section above. We disclose Personal Information as discussed in the “[How We Disclose Your Personal Data](#How-We-Disclose-Your-Personal-Data)” section above.  

In addition to this, the CCPA requires us to provide the “categories” of Personal Information we collect and the categories of entities to which we disclose such Personal Information. In the 12 months leading up to the effective date of the Privacy Notice, we have collected and disclosed Personal Information as follows:  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Category of Personal Information | Categories of entities to which the Personal Information was disclosed |
| Identifiers, such as name and IP address. | Affiliates and alliance partners; vendors; third parties for legal compliance purposes. |
| Commercial information, such as transaction information. | Affiliates and alliance partners; vendors; third parties for legal compliance purposes. |
| Professional or employment-related information, such as business contact information (email, phone number, physical address), job title, department, and employer name. | Affiliates and alliance partners; vendors; third parties for legal compliance purposes. |
| Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as cookie information, device identifier, browser type, operating system details, and information about how you interact with our Website. | Affiliates and alliance partners; vendors; third parties for legal compliance purposes. |

We retain Personal Information as described in the “[How We Protect Your Personal Data](#How-We-Protect-Your-Personal-Data)” section of the Privacy Notice above.  

**b. "Sales” and “sharing”**  

As part of a few of our uses and disclosures of Personal Information, during the 12 months leading up to the effective date of the Privacy Notice, we may have “sold” and “shared” (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) California residents’ Identifiers, Professional or employment-related information, and Internet or other electronic network activity information (each as described above) to advertising, marketing, and analytics services to assist with such activities. This practice continues today. We do not “sell” or “share” Personal Information (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.  

To exercise your CCPA right to opt out of what the CCPA calls “sales” or “sharing” of Personal Information, please follow the process set out [here](#).  

Your browser may also offer a way to activate the Global Privacy Control signal (“GPC”). Our Website treats qualifying browsers for which the user has activated the GPC signal as having opted out of what CCPA calls a “sale” of any California Personal Information that is collected on the Website from that browser using cookies and similar technology. If you are using a GPC-enabled browser but you choose to opt into cookies via the Cookie Consent tool on our Website, you may opt into “sales” or “sharing” via cookies and similar technologies, overriding the GPC signal.  

**c. California Privacy Rights** 

If you are a California resident, the CCPA may permit you to request that we:  

* Provide you the categories of Personal Information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last 12 months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or (if applicable) selling your Personal Information; and the categories of third parties to which we disclosed Personal Information, and more specific information about what categories of Personal Information were “sold,” “shared,” or disclosed to particular categories of third parties (much of this information is already provided above).
    
* Provide access to and/a copy of certain Personal Information we hold about you.
    
* Delete certain Personal Information we have about you.
    
* Correct certain Personal Information we have about you.
    

Certain Personal Information is exempt from such requests under applicable law. You also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any). You also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be discriminated against (within the meaning of the CCPA) for exercising your CCPA privacy rights.  

To request to exercise these CCPA rights, you may email us at [privacy@owndata.com](mailto:privacy@owndata.com). We may take certain steps to verify your identity before processing your request, including, where applicable, by requesting additional information. For security and legal reasons, we may not accept requests that require us to access third-party websites or services.  

You may also designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. For an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We have no obligation to honor requests from purported agents if we lack sufficient confidence that this has occurred and that they are authorized to submit the request on your behalf. We may require you to verify your identity directly with us before processing an agent's request.  

Although the CCPA also now confers certain rights to limit certain uses of what the CCPA calls “sensitive personal information,” we do not use that sort of information in a manner relevant to that opt-out right.  

**d. “Shine the Light” Disclosure**

The California “Shine the Light” law gives California residents the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the disclosure of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal information in this way.

We will indicate the date of the most recent update in this Privacy Notice. If we make a material change to this Privacy Notice, you will be provided with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.
