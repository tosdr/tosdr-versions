We may also automatically collect information regarding your use of our Services, such as pages that you visit before, during and after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use our Services. 
* **Cookies and Other Technologies.** We, as well as vendors that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies (“**Technologies**”) to automatically collect information through your use of our Services. 
    * **Cookies**. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.
    * **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons**. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:
