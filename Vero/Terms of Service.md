Terms of Use Agreement
======================

_Revised: November 17th, 2022_

### Our mission at Vero Labs, Inc. (“Vero,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is to provide a social network where the user is the center of the network, not an advertiser or some entity looking to follow and track you. Vero is a true social network where you can connect with other people and build your community without worrying about us tracking your behaviour for advertisers or selling your content. This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) includes the terms by which you may access and use that social network and the online and/or mobile services, website, and/or software provided on or in connection with that social network (collectively, the “Service”).

Because the law is technical and we need to protect our users (including you) and ourselves so that everyone has a great experience with the Service, the Agreement is set out in the “Legal Terms of Use” section below. (Also, our lawyers made us do it, and we want them to be happy too). However, we believe in transparency for our users so we’ve also provided you a plain-English explanation of this Agreement in the right column. So we’re clear, that column is only intended to provide an explanation of the “legalese” to the left and some examples of what the legal terms actually mean in practice. Only the “Legal Terms of Use” in the left column is legally binding, so please review those terms in addition to our plain-English explanation on the right before you use the Service.  
  
If you have any questions about this Agreement, please see the “Legal” section of our Support & FAQs page or contact us at any time at [\[email protected\]](https://vero.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Legal Terms of Use**

**Vero Accounts**

Your Vero account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Vero account on behalf of a client, company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that client, company, organization, or other entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that: (i) you are an authorized representative of the client, company, organization, or other entity with the authority to bind the client, company, organization, or other entity to this Agreement, (ii) that you have the express authorization of the client, company, organization or other entity to create and operate an account on behalf of the client, company, organization or other entity, and (iii) that you agree to this Agreement on the client, company, organization or other entity’s behalf.

You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Vero immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Vero will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the Settings within the Vero Mobile Software as defined below. By providing Vero your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by following the “Unsubscribe” link in the email messages. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

**What we're saying**

### **You must register for an account to use the features and functionalities of the Service. As part of the registration process and setting up an account, we ask you to provide us information about yourself, including your name and email address. You must also provide us your phone number so we can send you a verification text and make sure you’re a real person, because we only want real people on Vero!  
  
When you sign up for an account, we ask you to select a strong password. Make sure you keep your password safe and don’t let anyone else use your account since you’ll be responsible for any and all activity that occurs under your account. If you think someone else has your password or is using your account, let us know as soon as possible so we can help protect your account.**

**Legal Terms of Use**

**Service Rules**  
You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Vero servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Vero grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy publicly available materials from vero.co for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.  
  
Accessing any audiovisual content that may be available on the Service for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the functionality of the Service. “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Vero Service to a User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.

**What we're saying**

### **This Section contains our rules for using the Service. Please review and make sure you do not engage in any of these prohibited activities. Taking part in or assisting any third party in taking part in any of these prohibited activities may result in the termination of your account by Vero, in addition to any other remedies available to Vero.**

* * *

**Legal Terms of Use**

**User Interactions**  
You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Vero Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Vero shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.  
  
If you use the Service to communicate or administer a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes), you are responsible for the lawful operation of that promotion, including without limitation (i) the official rules; (ii) offer terms and eligibility requirements; (iii) compliance with applicable rules and regulations governing the promotion and all prizes offered, such as registration and regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdiction(s); and (iv) compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission Act and Federal Trade Commission Guidelines Concerning Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. Promotions on the Service must include the following: (i) a complete release of Vero by each entrant or participant; and (ii) an acknowledgement that the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, Vero, unless an authorized representative of Vero provides prior written consent. Vero will not assist you in the administration of your promotion and cannot advise you on whether consent is required for use of user content or on how to obtain any necessary consent. You agree that if you use the Service to administer your promotion, you do so at your own risk.

**What we're saying**

### **We cannot monitor every user of the Service, nor every user interaction. While we may provide you assistance (including dispute resolution), you are ultimately responsible for your interactions with other users on the Service.  
  
If you choose to run a contest or a promotion on the Service, then you are responsible for that promotion and ensuring it is run according to any applicable laws. You must make people aware that Vero does not sponsor your promotion unless we have officially agreed to do so.**

* * *

**Legal Terms of Use**

**User Content Ownership and License**  
Some areas of the Service allow Users to post or provide content such as profile information, videos, images, music, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service is referred to as “User Content”). We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you.  
  
As between you and Vero, you retain any and all right, title and interest in and to THE User Content you create, post, or otherwise make available through the Service. We claim no ownership rights over your User Content.  
  
In accordance with your choice of the privacy settings offered by the Service, and for as long as you have a VERO account, by posting or otherwise making available any User Content on or through the Service, you hereby grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Vero a limited, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, list information regarding, translate, distribute, syndicate, make derivative works of, or otherwise use your User Content, including (without limitation) your name, voice, and/or likeness as it is contained within your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed. **This license is being used by Vero solely as necessary to provide the Service, and for such other limited uses identified in our [Privacy Policy](https://vero.co/privacy-policy). This license is not being used by Vero to sell your User Content to third parties or otherwise profit off of your User Content in any way that would be unrelated to Vero providing and promoting the Service, and it does not give Vero any rights to own your User Content or limit your ability to use your User Content however you wish outside of the Service.**

**What we're saying**

### **Vero is a social network that allows you to post or share content like music, photos, and videos. We do not own your content and nothing under this Agreement transfers to us or to other users ownership of any of the content you post or share on the Service, nor does it restrict the way you use the content outside of the Service. It’s yours and we want to keep it that way.  
  
Again, we do not and will not own your content; however, since the Service is a social network, we need you to give us permission to use the content you post or share solely as necessary to provide the Service and for a few additional purposes identified in our Privacy Policy. Basically, it’s so when you post something, the other users you want to share it with can see or hear the content you posted on Vero.  
  
Digging deeper, here are some examples and more detailed explanations about the license you’re granting us in this Agreement:  
  
****Royalty-Free:** To be a viable social network where you can provide and exchange your content without restriction, we need to be able to use your content without having to pay you a fee for each use.  
  
**Sublicensable:** Vero works with third parties to provide the Service and some of those service providers need access to your content to assist us in providing you the features and functionalities of the Service. As the saying goes, it takes a village.  
  
**Reproduce:** When you provide content to the Service, we make copies of that content so that you may retain the original while a copy is displayed on your profile.  
  
**Modify:** The technical requirements of the Service may require us to modify your content so that it may be displayed on the Service, like resizing a photo to display on the Service.  
  
**Publish, Publicly Display, and Publicly Perform:** We need your permission to make your content available to other Vero users or on the public parts of the Service. For example, if you post a video, we must be able to publish the collective work on the Service; publicly display the images within the video; and publicly perform the audio contained in the video.  
  
**Translate:** Since Vero is a global network, we need your permission to translate your content into different languages to make it available to users around the world.  
  
**Distribute:** You grant us the right to deliver your content to other users you have connected with on the Service.  
  
**Make Derivative Works:** Derivative works include previews of your videos.  
  
**Rights to Name, Likeness and Image:** If you post a picture or video of yourself, we need these rights without having to blur your image in your photos and videos.  
  
**If you choose to run a contest or a promotion on the Service, then you are responsible for that promotion and ensuring it is run according to any applicable laws. You must make people aware that Vero does not sponsor your promotion unless we have officially agreed to do so.**

* * *

**Legal Terms of Use**

The User Content you create remains yours; however, by providing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others within the Service to view your User Content within the Service as permitted by the functionality of the Service, your settings and this Agreement. Vero has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is provided to the Service. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.  
  
You reserve all rights to your User Content not expressly granted in this Agreement and in our [Privacy Policy](https://vero.co/privacy-policy), and no right or license in your User Content is granted to Vero, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the [Privacy Policy](https://vero.co/privacy-policy). If you have any questions please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://vero.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**What we're saying**

### **In addition to the rights you grant to us, when you post your content on the Service, it may be accessed and viewed by other users of the Service and the public (if you’ve made such content available to the public on the Service). As such, we need you to grant those other users and the public (as applicable) rights to access and view the content you post and share as permitted by the features and functionality of the Service.  
  
WE REPEAT – YOUR CONTENT, NOT OURS. If anything in this section is unclear, please contact us at the email above and we will be happy to answer your question or resolve your concern.**

To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of or have the necessary rights to all the copyright rights, including without limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant the license granted below. Vero reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Vero believes, in its sole discretion, violates any of these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writers Guild of America, or any other rights organization.  
  
For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.

D. To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.  
  
Vero takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party creates, posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Vero shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to any User Content.

**What we're saying**

### **Please review this Section for our rules about content that you are allowed to post or share on the Service. We at Vero want to ensure a great and safe user experience so we have the right to monitor and/or remove your content in our sole discretion.  
  
When you post or share content on the Service – whether you own such content or it’s owned by someone else - you are responsible for getting the necessary permissions to do so. For example, if you post pictures of other people to the Service, you must get their permission or have the rights to use their image and to display it on the Service.  
  
You are solely responsible for the content you post or share on the Service and for the content of other users you come across using the Service, so provide, create and browse wisely.**

**A. Mobile Software.** We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Software. Vero does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Software and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. Vero hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one Vero account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software.

### **We allow users to run promotions and market their products or services on our Service. If you are a user running promotions or marketing your products on our Service, you must do so in compliance with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those of the Federal Trade Commission.  
  
Users who run promotions or market their products or services on our Service are not associated with us, nor are they promoting products or services on our behalf. These promotions are not Vero advertisements or sponsors paying Vero for access to you.  
  
Unlike other social media companies, we treat the promotions and marketing of users as user content. So if you don’t want to see the promotions or marketing of other users, simply unfollow the user or filter out those posts through your settings.**

### **In addition to allowing our users to promote their goods and services, we also allow users to make their products and services available for purchase. When you purchase products or services from another user on the Service, you’re purchasing them directly from the selling user – not Vero. We are not involved in the manufacturing, distribution, or any other part of the creation or sale of those products or services. If you and the selling user have a disagreement about the sale, we may assist you, but it is ultimately between you and the selling user to resolve the dispute.**

* * *

**Legal Terms of Use**

**Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**  
**A. Governing Law.** You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in New York; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in, New York County, New York for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that, New York County, New York is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.  
  
**B. Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM VERO. For any dispute with Vero, you agree to first contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://vero.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Vero has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York, unless you and Vero agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Vero from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.  
  
**C. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND VERO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

**What we're saying**

### **In the unlikely event of a legal dispute, we like to handle any disputes under the agreement through binding arbitration. Binding arbitration under this Agreement will take place in New York.  
  
YOU ARE AGREEING TO A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.**

**Legal Terms of Use**

**Changes to the Service**  
We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.  
  
**Changes to the Agreement and Notice**  
Vero may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Vero in our sole discretion. Vero reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Vero is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Vero may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

**What we're saying**

### **We at Vero are constantly innovating, so we reserve the right to change, suspend or end any part of the Service for any or no reason without liability to our users. We do not plan to end any of our services, but to the extent we figure out there are new products we need to launch or products that are not working then we need the flexibility to turn features on and off to make Vero better.  
  
We can also suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time or for any reason, including if we determine you violated this Agreement. We don’t want to have to do this and this is just so we can keep Vero a safe community.  
  
We may change this Agreement from time to time. Normally, these are unimportant changes so we just update the date at the bottom of this page and move on; however, if we change the Agreement in an important way, we will try to provide you notice of the change (which may include posting a notice on the Service or emailing you directly).**

* * *

**Legal Terms of Use**

**General**  
**A. Assignment.** This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Vero without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.  
  
**B. Entire Agreement/Severability.** This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Vero in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Vero concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.  
  
**C. No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Vero’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**What we're saying**

### **This Section contains necessary legal terms around how we can transfer the Agreement, what happens if a court finds any section of this Agreement invalid, and similar terms.**
