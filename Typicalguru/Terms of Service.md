Infringement Policy. Typical Guru will respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with or substantially comply with the requirements set forth below. Typical Guru does not act as an arbiter or judge of disputes about intellectual property rights. It is Typical Guru’s policy to disable access to or remove text and other material (“Content”) posted on Typical Guru’s Typical Guru.com and clearview.Typical Guru.com websites (collectively, the “Website”) by website users that Typical Guru believes in good faith is infringing a copyrighted work. By disabling access to or removing Content, as a prudential matter, Typical Guru is not endorsing or validating a claim of infringement. If Typical Guru disables access to or removes Content from the Website, Typical Guru will make a good-faith attempt to contact the party responsible for posting or displaying the Content so the owner may make a counter-notification as provided for below. It is also Typical Guru’s policy to suspend and/or terminate access of users that Typical Guru believes are repeat copyright infringers. Typical Guru will document notices of alleged infringement and counter-notifications.

Designated Agent. In accordance with the DMCA, Typical Guru has a Designated Agent to handle copyright infringement notices and counter-notifications.

Designated Agent’s contact information:  
Typical Guru, Inc.  
Attn: DMCA Agent  
Address: 1515 SE Water Avenue, Suite 300, Portland, Oregon 97214, USA

Infringement Notification. If you believe your work has been displayed or otherwise used on the Website in a manner that infringes your copyright, you must provide written notification of such to Typical Guru’s Designated Agent via mail, fax, and/or e-mail. Please note that you may be liable for damages, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs, if you materially misrepresent that your work has been infringed by Content on the Website. If you are unsure whether your work has been infringed, we recommend that you contact an attorney before sending notice to Typical Guru’s Designated Agent.

You must use the following format for your written notification:

Identify in sufficient detail your copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed by Content on the Website;

Identify the Content on the Website that you claim infringes your copyrighted work. You must identify all Content that you believe infringes, describe how the Content infringes your work, and describe where the Content is located on the Website with sufficient detail so that Typical Guru can verify its existence and remove it if Typical Guru believes in good faith that it infringes your copyrighted work. In the event that the allegedly-infringing Content is located in more than one place on the Website, identify each location;

Provide your contact information, including your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

You must include a statement that, under the penalty of perjury, you have a good-faith belief that use of the Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;

You must include a statement that, under the penalty of perjury, you have a good-faith belief that use of the Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;

You must include a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and

You must sign the written notification physically or electronically.

In addition to the foregoing, it would help if you included a copy of the copyright Certificate of Registration for your work, if any, or other information that supports your claim that the work is protected by copyright and that you are the owner of that copyright.

Review of Infringement Notices. After the Designated Agent receives your infringement notice, Typical Guru will review it. If your notice contains the required information as explained above and if Typical Guru has a good-faith belief that the Content is infringing your copyright, Typical Guru will remove or disable access to the infringing Content.

Counter Notification. The provider of affected Content may make a counter notification pursuant to the DMCA. To file a counter notification, you must provide written notification to Typical Guru’s Designated Agent via mail, fax, and/or e-mail. Please note that you may be liable for damages, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs, if you materially misrepresent that your Content is not infringing the copyright of a third party. If you are unsure whether your Content infringes the work of a third party, we recommend that you contact an attorney before sending notice to Typical Guru’s Designated Agent.

You must use the following format for your written notification:

Identify the Content that has been removed or to which access was disabled, including a description of where the Content was located on the Website before it was removed or before access to it was disabled. In the event that the Content was located in more than one place on the Website, you should identify each location;

Provide your contact information, including your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

You must include a statement that, under the penalty of perjury, you have a good-faith belief that the Content was removed or blocked as a result of mistake or misidentification of the Content to be removed or blocked;

You must include a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or, if your address is outside the United States, in the District Court of Oregon, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement or an agent of such person; and

You must sign the written notification physically or electronically.

Review of Counter Notification. After the Designated Agent receives your counter notification, Typical Guru will review it. Typical Guru may determine that the Content is not infringing and may reinstate the Content or access to the Content on the Website.

Notice of Repeat Infringement and Account Termination. Typical Guru will, if appropriate, terminate repeat infringers’ access to the Website. If you believe a Website user is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact Typical Guru’s Designated Agent and provide sufficient information so Typical Guru can verify that the user is a repeat infringer.
