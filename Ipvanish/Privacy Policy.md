Privacy Policy for IPVanish Site & Services
===========================================

### This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 21, 2024

[Dutch](https://www.ipvanish.com/nl/privacy-policy/), [French](https://www.ipvanish.com/privacy-policy/), [German](https://www.ipvanish.com/de/privacy-policy/), [Portuguese](https://www.ipvanish.com/pt/privacy-policy/), [Spanish](https://www.ipvanish.com/es/privacy-policy/)

We believe everyone has the right to digital privacy. Along with digital privacy, consumers also have the right to transparency. Because you are entrusting us with your data, we believe it is even more important that we are transparent with you regarding **what** information we collect, **how** it is collected, from **where** it is collected, and **why** it is necessary to collect. We wrote this privacy policy with you in mind, attempting our best to provide a comprehensive yet easy to understand document.

**The short version**

* IPVanish **does not collect, monitor, or log your browsing activity**, such as what websites you went on, when connected to the VPN Service.
* We collect aggregated and anonymous performance data to improve functionality and product performance, diagnose crashes, identify bugs, and optimize server performance. This aggregated and anonymous data does not include IP address, connection time stamps, or DNS inquiries.
* Our goal is to collect and retain the least amount of data. However we have to collect and retain some data, such as email address and billing information, which allows for you to continue using the VPN service.
* We **do not sell or rent your personal information** to third parties.
* You have the right to request, review, and request deletion of your personal data.

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or the information that is collected you may reach out to our support team or make a privacy request via [https://dsar.ipvanish.com](https://dsar.ipvanish.com/).

This Policy explains how we collect and store (“**Process**”) Personal Data. The Policy applies to the information we collect about visitors (the “**you**”) to www.ipvanish.com (the “**Site**“) and subscribers (the “**you**”) to the IPVanish VPN service (the “**Services**” and “**App**”), which are owned and operated by IPVanish (“**Company**”, “**we**”, “**us**” and “**our**”). For the purposes of this Policy, Company is the Controller. Terms used in this Policy are explained in Section I below.

From time to time, we may change or update this Policy, without prior notice to you. Your continued use of the Site or Services constitutes your acceptance of the then-effective Policy.

Our Terms of Service, including their limitation on liability, apply to this Policy. You can read them [here](https://www.ipvanish.com/tos/).

If you have any questions regarding this Policy, the information that is collected, or GDPR request, contact details are provided in Section N below.

### B. Collection and Creation of Personal Data

We collect Personal Data: directly from you, through the use of the Site, and through the use of the Apps.

How we obtain personal data:

* **You:** This data is collected when you fill out a form on our website; subscribe to the VPN Service; when you contact us via email, chat, telephone, social media platforms, or by any other means; when you publicly submit reviews on forums, review platforms, or any other means.
* **Our Sites:** This data is collected when you visit any of our Sites, our partner and affiliate sites, or interact with our advertisements.
* **Our App:** This data is collected when you download, install, or use our Apps.

Why we obtain personal data:

* **Provisioning of Services.** To create your account, collect payment for our Services, verify your identity when you log into the Site, and administer accounts.
* **Operating and Improving the Site.** To better understand how our Site is found, how visitors engage with our Site, provide visitors with relevant content or advertisements, identify issues with our Site, plan improvements to our Site or to create new Sites.
* **Operating and Improving the App.** To identify Service performance issues, improve App performance, fix bugs, plan improvements to our App or to create new Apps.
* **Communications.** To send you information about industry news, product updates, changes to any of our Sites or Apps, to send you offers made available by us, our affiliates, or our marketing partners and to respond to your requests for help and technical assistance.

We may also create Personal Data about you, such as records of your interactions with our customer service department or details of your payments to us.

### C. Categories of Personal Data

You are not required to provide any personal data to browse our Site. If you wish to subscribe to our Services, you will need to provide an active email address and billing information.

We may Process the following categories of Personal Data about you:

* **The Site:** We process aggregated anonymous personal data from Site visitors using cookies, pixels, and similar technologies, such as Google Analytics. See our [Cookie policy](https://www.ipvanish.com/privacy-policy/cookies/) for the complete list of cookies. Depending on your browser privacy settings the aggregated anonymous data may include: _browser type, device type, operating system, average time spent on our site, pages visited on the site, interactions with our content or advertising, gender, age, language preference, and country_. The focus of this data collection is to improve our Site performance and provide you with the best browsing experience. Our [Cookie policy](https://www.ipvanish.com/privacy-policy/cookies/) explains how to disable cookies to browse our Site without submitting any personal information.
* **The Service:** In order to subscribe to our Services you must first create an account. This will result in us creating a purchase history for the purpose of maintaining an active subscription to the Service. Depending on your purchase origin (website, Google Play Store, Apple App Store) and chosen payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc) the data collected may include: email address, name, billing address, credit card information, IP address, and affiliate tracking data. We will only use this information to process payments, and detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. We do keep a historical record of credit card charges for accounting purposes. Once you have created an account, this personal information can be modified by you at any time through your [Account Control Panel](https://account.ipvanish.com/).
* **The App:** We process **aggregated anonymous** data to improve the quality of our Apps and Services. The data collected may include: _User’s language preference, device brand, device model, OS version, country, crash reports, session lengths, server usage, protocol, build version, UI interactions, API requests and response codes, and app build version_. Our VPN applications utilize [analytics tools](https://www.ipvanish.com/privacy-policy/tools/), such as FireBase and App Center, to gather and report performance data anonymously. We respect the privacy of our customers and only use this aggregated anonymous data to diagnose crashes, identify bugs, optimize server performance, and provide you with the best App experience.
    * The client apps themselves do maintain connection logs which are stored as diagnostic files on your device. Diagnostic connection files are made available solely for the purpose to assist with troubleshooting. The macOS and iOS app diagnostic logs are disabled by default, so if you require assistance where diagnostic logs are necessary, the support team may ask you to enable the setting. We do NOT have access to the connection logs unless provided by you, the user, to our support team through a diagnostic file. If for any reason you need to submit a diagnostic file to our support team you may modify the file and remove any personal data and/or request for the file to be redacted from the support interaction.

### D. Email Communications

As a service provider we send transactional and promotional emails. Transactional emails are necessary to ensure continuation of services and include account activation, billing, password, and support related communications. You may also receive promotional emails about privacy & security industry news, service updates, product updates, feature releases, and other information we think may interest you. We use [third-party services](https://www.ipvanish.com/privacy-policy/tools/) to assist us with email communications.

Transactional emails include the following:

* **Payment warning and failure** – These emails inform you when there is a problem with your payment method and advise on how to prevent service interruption.
* **Account cancellation** – This email confirms your cancellation request and explains how to reactivate your account, if you wish to.

* **Password reset** – This email provides a unique password-reset link and instructs how to complete your password reset.
* **New password** – This email confirms your password reset and explains how to change your password in the future, if you wish to.
* **Customer Support** – If, for any reason, you reach out to customer support, we may use emails to communicate with you, follow up from a call-in support inquiry and send chat transcripts. This will result in us creating a support history for the purpose of improving our Services.

Promotional emails include the following:

* **Product** – All new subscribers to IPVanish receive product awareness emails. These emails offer application tips and helpful hints to IPVanish account holders who may be unfamiliar with the benefits and inner-workings of a VPN.
* **Other** – Additional promotional emails you may receive from us include industry related news, special offers, surveys, feedback requests, new feature releases, and service updates.

Unsubscribing From Promotional Emails

You may unsubscribe from our promotional email list at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every promotional email we send. We will not send you promotional emails from a list you have unsubscribed from, but we may continue to contact you, if necessary, for the purposes of continuation of the Service or from additional lists you have signed up under.

* Contractual necessity: We Process your Personal Data where the Processing is necessary in connection with providing contracted-for VPN services to you;
* Compliance with applicable law: We may Process your Personal Data where the Processing is required by applicable law;

### H. Tools and Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties

We use third-party services to assist us with processing payments, fraud detection, improving website performance, app crash information, and communications. These service providers receive only the information needed to perform their designated functions, and are not permitted to use the information for their own marketing, advertising or research purposes. We do not sell personal information to third parties. Additional information on the third-party tools can be found in the tables listed [here](https://www.ipvanish.com/privacy-policy/tools/).

We closely review any third party requests we receive for customer information. Since we do not collect, monitor or log your browsing activity, we do not have logs of your browsing activity to provide in response to third party requests. We cannot provide information that we do not have, and we otherwise provide information only when we are legally required to.

### O. International transfer of Personal Data

To provide you with the Services under your contract, it is necessary for us to store, process and transmit your personal data in the United States and other locations around the world. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

When we process the data within our group, regardless of where we are, we have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data will remain protected in accordance with European Union data protection laws. These safeguards include the Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers to our non-EEA entities. Where we use third parties which process your personal data internationally, we have implemented similar appropriate safeguards to ensure your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this privacy policy.

IPRE participates in the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Framework and the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. Where we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to a recipient outside the EEA that is not in an adequate jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses. 

Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your information within the group companies, and to third parties as noted above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we may transfer your information to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located. 

IPVANISH and its associated affiliates and subsidiaries complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  IPVANISH has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  IPVANISH has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https:](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)[/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)[/www.dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).  

If you are a European individual with a privacy related complaint, concern or question about Ziff Davis’ privacy practices, please contact us through our [**DSAR Portal**](http://dsar.ipvanish.com/). Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Data Privacy Framework website, European individuals may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. 

Where we transfer your personal information from the EEA to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in a jurisdiction that has been formally designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for information, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses. You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses using our [**DSAR Portal**](http://dsar.ipvanish.com/). Please note that when you transfer any personal information directly to an entity established outside the EEA, we are not responsible for that transfer of your information. We will nevertheless process your information, from the point at which we receive the data, in accordance with the provisions of this policy.  

We are committed to staying current with developments related to the Data Privacy Framework and may update our transfer mechanisms and safeguards as necessary to remain compliant. Any updates will be reflected in this Privacy Policy.     

**Enforcement Authority**
