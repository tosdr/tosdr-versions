ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS; MODIFICATION OF TERMS



Audius is a fully decentralized music service owned, operated, and governed by its community of artists,

labels, fans, developers, and node operators (the “Audius Network"). Audius is comprised of open source,

decentralized, content hosting, streaming, and delivery infrastructure leveraging blockchain protocols and

other decentralized technologies (the “Audius Protocol” and together with the Audius Service (defined

below), the “Platform”). See https://docs.audius.org/protocol/overview and White Paper (defined below)

for more information regarding the Audius Protocol.



Tiki Labs, Inc. (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”), part of the Audius Network and a contributor to the Audius

Protocol, operates the website, https://audius.co (including, without limitation, all subdomains thereof,

collectively the “Site”), and through each of the “Audius” branded desktop and mobile applications

(collectively, the “App”, and together with the Site, the “Audius Service”). For the avoidance of doubt,

Company does not own nor control the Audius Network or the Audius Protocol.



These terms and conditions (these “Terms of Use”) and all other terms of service, terms and conditions,

policies, guidelines, and documents incorporated by reference herein (collectively, but excluding these Terms

of Use, the “Ancillary Documents”), which may be in effect and modified from time-to-time, including,

without limitation, the Privacy Policy, constitute a legally binding agreement between Company and each

registered or unregistered end user of the Audius Service (each, a “User”, “you” or “your”, and as described

in more detail in the Ancillary Documents). Simply by using the Audius Service in any way, such as visiting,

browsing, listening to, or publishing Content on it, you are considered to have read, accepted, and agreed to

abide by the Terms of Use. Your use of the Audius Service may also be governed by documentation set forth

by other participants in the Audius Network. Such documents include, without limitation, the Audius White

Paper available at https://whitepaper.audius.co (“White Paper”), the Audius Protocol guidelines and

requirements as published in the Audius wiki and available at https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-

protocol/wiki) (“Protocol Guidelines”), and the Audius blog (https://blog.audius.co/) (“Audius Blog”)),



YOU MUST BE AT LEAST THIRTEEN (13) YEARS TO ACCESS AND USE THE AUDIUS SERVICE; PROVIDED, IF YOU

ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTEEN (13) AND EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD (OR ANY GREATER AGE REQUIRED

TO HAVE REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW OF THE STATE OR JURISDICTION OF

YOUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE), YOU MAY ONLY ACCESS AND USE THE AUDIUS SERVICE WITH THE PRIOR

PERMISSION OF YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU

HAVE SUCH PERMISSION AND THAT YOUR PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HAS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED

THE TERMS OF USE WITH YOU. SINCE CERTAIN CONTENT (E.G., SOUND RECORDINGS THAT MAY CONTAIN

EXPLICIT LYRICS, ETC.) MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE AUDIUS SERVICE MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR

MINORS, WE RECOMMEND THAT PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS WHO PERMIT THEIR CHILD TO ACCESS

AND USE THE AUDIUS SERVICE SUPERVISE SUCH CHILD’S ACTIVITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY

ENGAGEMENT WITH ANY CONTENT OR OTHER USER.

The Audius Service is only available to users in certain jurisdictions who can use the Audius Service as

permitted under applicable law. You certify that you will comply with all applicable laws (e.g., local, state,

federal and other laws) when using the Audius Service. Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Audius

Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.

Government embargo; and (b) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited, sanctioned, or

restricted parties. If you access or use the Audius Service outside the United States, you are solely responsible

for ensuring that your access and use of the Audius Service in such country, territory, or jurisdiction does not

violate any applicable laws. You must not use any software or networking techniques, including use of a

Virtual Private Network (VPN) to modify your internet protocol address or otherwise circumvent or attempt

to circumvent this prohibition. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor the locations from

which our Audius Service are accessed. Furthermore, we reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion,

to block access to the Audius Service, in whole or in part, from any geographic location, IP addresses, and

unique device identifiers, or to any user who we believe is in breach of these Terms or Ancillary Documents.



Company may change or amend these Terms of Use or any of the Ancillary Documents at any time at its sole

and absolute discretion. In addition, from time to time: (i) Company may (a) implement changes to existing

tools, products, services, functionalities, and/or features to the Audius Service, or release/introduce new

tools, products, services, functionalities, features, and/or other updates to the Audius Service (collectively,

“Updates”) or (b) release new versions of the Audius Service, in each case which may result in changes or

amendments to the Terms of Use; and/or (ii) Governance Participants may adopt and implement upgrades

to the Audius Protocol (“Upgrade Proposals“) for the Platform via the Governance Protocol, which may also

result in changes or amendments to the Terms of Use. To learn more about the Governance Protocol, who

are Governance Participant and Node Operators, and how changes can be made to the Platform via Upgrade

Proposals, see the Governance Protocol and Node Operator FAQ (the “FAQ”).



If Company makes a material change or amendment to the Terms of Use it will deliver a notification of such

changes or amendments on or through the Audius Service or notify all registered Users of such changes or

amendments via e-mail or as otherwise reasonably appropriate, which changes, or amendments will be

effective automatically upon the posting of such notification or as of the date of delivery of such notification

via e-mail or otherwise. If there are any adopted/implemented Upgrade Proposals for the Platform, which

also result in changes or amendments to the Terms of Use, these will be visible on the Governance Dashboard

(defined below) and will be effective automatically upon the effective date of the adoption of such Upgrade

Proposal per the terms of such Upgrade Proposal resolution. We therefore encourage you to review the

Terms of Use fully and carefully and to check the Terms of Use as well as all Platform governance proposals

(see, https://dashboard.audius.org/#/governance, the “Governance Dashboard”) periodically for any

Updates or adopted/implemented Upgrade Proposals. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures,

and other communications we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such

communications be in writing. Notwithstanding the terms of this paragraph, no revisions to the Terms of

Use will apply to any dispute between you and Company that arose prior to the effective date of such revision.



All Updates to the Audius Service implemented by Company and/or all Updates implemented as a result of

any Upgrade Proposals that have been adopted and implemented to the Audius Network via the Governance

Protocol, will be subject to the Terms of Use, and any additional terms and conditions as may apply to such

Updates or adopted/implemented Upgrade Proposals.



IF ANY PROVISION OF THE TERMS OF USE OR ANY FUTURE CHANGES OR AMENDMENTS ARE UNACCEPTABLE

TO YOU, DO NOT USE OR STOP USING THE AUDIUS SERVICE AND DO NOT CREATE/REGISTER OR CONTINUE

TO MAINTAIN A USER ACCOUNT. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE AUDIUS SERVICE FOLLOWING THE POSTING

OF ANY NOTICE OF ANY CHANGE OR AMENDMENT TO THE TERMS OF USE OR THE ADOPTION OF ANY

CHANGE OR UPDATE TO THE AUDIUS SERVICE VIA THE GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL SHALL AUTOMATICALLY

CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE AND AGREEMENT TO SUCH CHANGE, AMENDMENT OR UPDATE.



TYPES OF AUDIUS USERS



The following types of Users are permitted to use the Audius Service, subject to these Terms of Service:

disclaim and hold Company harmless from and against any and all liability arising from a User’s interaction

with, or conduct towards, any other User or Content (whether online or offline). Company reserves the right

to determine, in its sole discretion, what constitutes harassment, mischief, or unacceptable conduct with or

towards other Users or Content, and where that has occurred, and may in its sole discretion, report such User

to the appropriate authorities, or to the Governance Protocol of the Platform to allow Governance

Participants to adjudicate such behavior.

LISTENERS



If you are accessing and using the Audius Service in your capacity as a Listener, you hereby acknowledge and

agree that unless expressly approved by any applicable Creator who has opted into, or turned on, any

applicable Audius Service feature and functionality settings that allow for this, and subject in all respects to

the Terms of Use and any other terms and conditions or other restrictions applicable to such Creator opt-in

and/or permission grant, you may only make personal and non-commercial use of the Content and any NFT

Items published to the Audius Service by Creators, and you may not sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit

any such Content or NFT Items for commercial purposes or in any way that violates the Terms of Use or the

rights of any third-party.



Each Listener further acknowledges and agrees that a Creator may restrict or limit the specific manner in

which such Listener can access, listen to, or otherwise interact with Content or any NFT Items that such

Creator has published or otherwise made available on or through the Audius Service (e.g., by permitting a

Listener to stream certain Content but not download or share such Content off-Audius Service), or, if such

feature becomes available via the Audius Service, impose a fee in order for such Listener to access, listen to,

or otherwise interact with such Content or NFT Items. Each Listener hereby agrees to comply with any

imposed fee requirements (as applicable) or other imposed requirements (e.g., USDC gating requirements)

and/or to use Content and any NFT Items solely in accordance with the specific permissions granted and

restrictions imposed by the applicable Creator thereof. Any use of Content or any NFT Items outside of those

permissions and/or restrictions set by the applicable Creator therefor requires the separate and express

written permission of such Creator in each instance.



CREATORS



Creators acknowledge and agree that any Content uploaded to the Audius Service will automatically become

publicly available to all Users of the Audius Service (and will be stored on one or more Content Nodes within

the Audius Protocol) via the distribution functionalities described in, and in accordance with, the Terms of

Use, and that you will not have the option of making such Content private, provided that you may choose to

“de-list” certain Content from the Audius Service by clicking on your Content and selecting the “delete”

option (we have no obligation to cause Content Node Operators to delete your Content from their servers).

All Users of the Audius Service will be able to listen to, like, follow, repost, share (applicable Content

hyperlink), and/or interact with your published Content, and view how many other Users have

liked/followed/listened to such Content.



Content Defined



As used herein and throughout the Terms of Use, “Content” shall mean all sound recordings, musical

compositions (including lyrics), photographs, cover art, images, metadata, information, text, graphics,

designs, and any other content, material, original works of authorship, and/or intellectual property that is

published or otherwise made available on or through the Audius Service by a Creator for a Listener to access,

listen to, or otherwise interact with, via the Audius Service.



Creator Content License



If you are accessing and using the Audius Service in your capacity as a Creator, you hereby represent and

warrant to Company that: (i) all Content that you publish or otherwise make available on or through the

Audius Service is your original work of authorship for which you are the sole and exclusive owner, or that you

have obtained all licenses, consents, releases, and other permissions from the applicable third-party owner(s)

thereof as may be necessary to grant Company the Content License in and to such Content hereunder, and

(ii) the use of such Content by Company and/or any other User or sublicensee of Company, or any Node

Operator, does not, and will not, violate any applicable laws or the rights of any third-party, including, without

limitation, any right of publicity, right of privacy, copyright, patent, trademark, or other intellectual property

right or proprietary right.



Each Creator retains all right, title and interest in and to any Content (including all copyrights and other

intellectual property rights related thereto or contained therein) that it publishes or otherwise makes

available on or through the Audius Service; provided, however, that each such Creator hereby grants to

Company and its affiliates, successors, licensees, and assigns, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,

irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, transferrable, assignable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right and

license to use, copy, reproduce, display, distribute, publish, modify, adapt, make derivative works of, make

collective works with, translate, and otherwise exploit (i) such Content (including all copyrights and other

intellectual property rights related thereto or contained therein) and (ii) such Creator’s name, image, voice,

likeness, profile information, and biographical material (as applicable), and any other right of

publicity/privacy held by such Creator in connection with such Content, in any and all media now known or

hereafter discovered, in connection with the Audius Service and other third-party services using an API

provided by Audius (including, without limitation, the operation thereof and the provision of any tools,

products, services, functionalities and/or features now or in the future offered in connection therewith), the

advertising, marketing, promotion, publicity, and merchandizing of the Audius Service and any products and

services related thereto, and to identify such Creator as the source of the applicable Content (collectively,

the “Content License”).



For the avoidance of doubt, the Content License granted to us hereunder covers our ability to sublicense to,

and permit, all Users of the Audius Service to use each Creator’s Content in connection with all tools,

products, services, functionalities and/or features made available in connection with the Platform from time

to time, subject to the Terms of Use, and further extends to all applicable Node Operators providing their

requisite services for the Audius Protocol, and each Creator specifically acknowledges and agrees that certain

rights being granted pursuant to the Content License will be sublicensed and passed through to such other

Users and additionally extended to such Node Operators. Moreover, the Content License granted hereunder

includes the right for Company, other Users, and certain Node Operators for the Platform to reproduce,

transmit and otherwise distribute Content consisting of sound recordings (and to make mechanical

reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings) via the Platform, and to publicly

perform and communicate to the public such Content consisting of sound recordings (and the musical works

embodied therein) via the Platform, all on a royalty-free basis (subject only to any fee that may be imposed

on Listeners by the applicable Creator thereof, as applicable, the remittance of which shall be the sole

responsibility of such Listeners); which means that you are granting Company, the other Users, and certain

Node Operators for the Platform (as applicable) the right to use your Content without the obligation to pay

royalties to any third-party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record

label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP,

BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “PRO”), a sound recording collective rights management organization (e.g.,

SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the

creation of Content. If any Creator is a composer or author of a musical work and is affiliated with a PRO,

then such Creator must notify its PRO of the royalty-free license it grants through these Terms of Use. Such

Creator is solely responsible for ensuring its compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If such

Creator has assigned its rights to a record label or music publisher, then it must obtain the consent of such

record label or music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms of Use or have

such record label or music publisher enter into the Terms of Use directly by creating its own User Account

with us. Creators should not presume that since it authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) or recorded

one that it has all the rights necessary to grant us the licenses in these Terms of Use. Additionally, if such

feature is made available on the Audius Service, to the extent any Creator charges a Listener an fee for such

Listener to access, listen to or otherwise engage in certain interactions with, any Content, such Creator shall

be solely responsible for accounting to, and/or remitting any applicable pro-rata portion of, any such fee that

it receives to any applicable third party(ies) that may be entitled to such under applicable law or pursuant to

any agreement entered into between such Creator and any such applicable third party(ies) and such Creator

acknowledges and agrees that Company shall have no obligation or liability therefor.



Each Creator acknowledges and agrees that the Audius Service enable Listeners to post hyperlinks to certain

Content onto third party websites/applications, social media channels, and messaging platforms and that the

Content License granted to us hereunder is provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the

owners or operators of such third party websites/applications, social media channels, and messaging

platforms will not have any separate liability to any Creator or any other third-party as a result of any such

Content hyperlinks being uploaded to its service/platform.



By uploading any Content to the Audius Service, each Creator waives any rights to prior inspection or approval

of any marketing or promotional materials for the Audius Service that relate to such Content. Each Creator

also waives any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with

its Content, or any portion thereof, in connection with the use thereof as contemplated herein. To the extent

any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, each Creator hereby waives and agrees never to assert

any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that it may

have in or with respect to the use of any Content published or otherwise made available on or through the

Audius Service and hosted or otherwise transmitted on or through the Audius Protocol in accordance with

the Terms of Use.



Each Creator acknowledges and agrees that Company may establish general practices and limits concerning

use of the Audius Service, or that certain Upgrade Proposals adopted/implemented via the Governance

Protocol may require the Company to adopt general practices and limits concerning the use of the Audius

Service, including without limitation the maximum number of days that Content uploaded via the Audius

Service will be retained by Content Node Operators, or made available through, the Audius Service, and the

maximum storage space that will be allotted on Content Node Operators’ systems on such Creator’s behalf.



Each Creator further acknowledges and agrees that it has no control over the amount of Content Node

Operators participating in the Audius Protocol, the amount of storage space (above the minimum system

requirements [e.g., storage, RAM] set forth in the Protocol Guidelines) made available by such Content Node

Operators, or any other actions or inactions of any Node Operator(s). Each Creator further acknowledges

and agrees that although the Audius Protocol has developed policies and proposed steps to be taken by Node

Operators upon request from Company in connection with the blocking or deleting of Content, Company

ultimately has no responsibility or liability for the blocking or deleting of any Content from the Node Operator

systems, or failure to store any Content maintained or transmitted by such Node Operator systems through

to the Audius Service. Each Creator further acknowledges that Company reserves the right to change these

general practices and limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice to such Creator, and that

other changes to these general practices and limits may be established from time to time via the Governance

Protocol.



For more information regarding the Governance Protocol and the Node Operators that provide Content-

related services for the Platform, see the FAQ.



Monetization / Verified Accounts



Monetizing Creators



The Platform may offer features that allow Creators to limit access to specific Content in exchange for

payment from Listeners. Creators who select to monetize any of their Content are referred to herein as

“Monetizing Creators”, such Content is referred to as “Monetized Content”, and Listeners who purchase

Monetized Content are referred to as “Paying Listeners.” Creators who monetize their content can choose

the price for accessing it, and Listeners can make payments as explained in the Payments section below.



Compensation



Monetizing Creators will receive payment for their Monetized Content, less the following:



- Audius Network Costs, which are set forth by the Governance Protocol (see FAQ here)



- Applicable sales taxes paid by Company to the appropriate authorities;



- Applicable third-party platform fees (including, but not limited to, app store and third party payment

processor commissions and fees);



- Costs associated with obtaining publishing and performing rights licenses;



- Royalties payable to third-party rightsholders other than the Monetizing Creator.



Paying Listeners



To become a Paying Listener, you’ll need to buy content offered within the Audius Service on a Monetizing

Creator’s page. Once you've followed these terms and paid all the relevant charges set by the Monetizing

Creator, you'll receive a limited license. This license is non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,

revocable, and allows you to access the specific content for your own private, personal, non-promotional,

and non-commercial use. The content you acquire through this process will usually remain accessible, but

there might be times when it becomes unavailable, as explained below.



Payments



Paying Listeners may make payments in exchange for access to Monetized Content via the Audius Service by

depositing USDC manually into their Audius accounts, or using Coinbase, Stripe, or other 3rd party payment

vendors made available by Audius from time-to-time (“Payment Partners”). Payment Partners will allow

Paying Listeners to add funds to their account to be transferred to the Monetizing Creator. When Paying

Listeners add funds to their accounts via the Payment Partners, such Payment Partners will send Paying

Listeners USDC, which will then be delivered to the Monetizing Creator.



When a Paying Listener opts to buy Monetized Content using a Payment Partner, the Paying Listener is

subject to the rules, regulations, and other obligations specified in each such Payment Partners’ terms of use.

If a Paying Listener pays via a Payment Partner or in a currency that is different from the currency associated

with their payment instrument, then there may be an additional transaction fee in connection with that

payment. Audius is not applying this fee and has no control over it, has no knowledge of whether the fee is

applied, and does not receive any of the funds from that fee.



Refunds



The quality of Monetized Content offerings can vary, and Audius has no control over this. The Audius network

does not offer refunds, even if you lose access to Monetized Content as explained earlier. However, in specific

cases, Company may consider granting refunds at its own discretion.

Creator Promotions \& Contests



As a Creator, you can organize 'remix' contests for your Content directly within the Audius Service.

Additionally, we may introduce functionality in the future for you to run other types of promotions and

contests for your Content (each, a “Creator Contest”). We provide features and functionality that make it

easy to share, judge and approve submissions through the Audius Service.



You acknowledge that when you host and promote a Creator Contest, you are solely responsible for

complying with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations and any guidance issued by any government

entity (i.e., FTC Endorsement Guidelines) applicable to such Creator Contests, including, without limitation,

all applicable gaming laws, and any Third-Party Terms when promoting your Creator Contest on third-party

social platforms (e.g., Twitter, Discord). You are strictly prohibited from referencing Company and/or the

Audius Service in any manner that directly or indirectly suggests that Company or the Audius Service is an

administrator, sponsor, promoter, advertiser, affiliate, or prize administrator or is any way a service provider

for such Creator Contest, provided that you may post on third-party platforms a direct link to your Creator

Contest page on the Audius Service for the sole purpose of re-directing potential entrants from such third-

party platforms to your Creator Contest page on the Audius Service.



You represent and warrant that if you host a Creator Contest on or through the Audius Service that you will

conduct such Creator Contest solely through use of the features and functionalities on the Audius Service

expressly designated for Creator Contests and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well

as the guidelines set forth in these Terms of Use. You acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely

responsible for any and all liability arising out of any Creator Contest that you conduct via the Audius Service,

including, without limitation, any damages or liability resulting from other User’s participation in such Creator

Contest, or any failure for such Creator Contest to comply with applicable law, and you hereby agree to

indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company Parties from and against any and all Liabilities related to

such Creator Contest. You further acknowledge and agree that Company has no obligation to monitor such

Creator Contest or enforce these Terms of Use in connection therewith, and any User who elects to

participate in a Creator Contest shall direct any and all claims for damages in connection with such Creator

Contest solely to the applicable Creator thereof.



For more details on how to conduct a Creator Contest on the Audius Service, please see our blog post at

https://blog.audius.co/posts/remix-contests-on-audius, as well as and a visual explanation posted on our

Twitter account, https://twitter.com/AudiusProject/status/1272614652623519744?s=20.



Each Creator further acknowledges and agrees that by hosting a “remix” Creator Contest, any User entrant

who wishes to participate will have access to downloadable “stems” of particular portions of the Content

(“Content-stem”) made available by such Creator for such “remix” Creator Contest. Once a Content-stem is

downloaded by a particular User entrant, Company will have no control over how that User entrant may elect

to use the Content-stem, and Company shall not be liable or responsible in any way for any User entrant’s

use of such Content-stem outside of the applicable “remix” Creator Contest rules, in violation of these Terms

of Use, or any other unapproved use or misuse of such Content-stem by any applicable User entrant that

Creator has made available for a “remix” Creator Contest. Each Creator expressly acknowledges that all User

entrants of a “remix” Creator Contest will have the ability to download Content-stems made available by such

Creator to their personal storage device and accepts all risks regarding any improper use by a User entrant

of any Content-stems once such Content-stems are downloaded. To the extent a User entrant makes an

unauthorized use of any Content-stems, the Creator of the applicable “remix” Creator Contest may pursue

any action it wishes to take directly against such User entrant, but such Creator acknowledges and agrees

that Company will have no obligations to assist with or otherwise participate in any such outside action

pursued. To the extent other types of Creator Contests are offered via the features and functionalities of the

Audius Service in the future in which Content (or portions thereof) may be made available for download by

a User entrant onto such User entrant’s personal storage device, Company similarly disclaims all liability and

responsibility for the use of such Content (or portions thereof) by any particular User entrant, and each

Creator that sponsors any such Creator Contest similar acknowledges and accepts all risks regarding any

improper use by a User entrant of any such Content (or portions thereof) once downloaded.



Each User who elects to enter any Creator Contest represents and warrants that such User will comply with

any and all Creator Contest rules, and further represents and warrants that as applicable, such User will not

make use of any Content (or Content-stems or other portions thereof) that may be made available for

download onto such User’s personal storage device other than as required to participate in such Creator

Contest or in any other manner not expressly permitted pursuant to such Creator Contest rules and/or the

Terms of Use.



$AUDIO Token Wallet; Third Party Wallet



While creating a User Account for access to and use of the Audius Service is technically “free”, the entire

Platform is powered by the $AUDIO Token, known as “$AUDIO” (the “$AUDIO Token”), which the Company

does not control, which drives all aspects of the Platform, including, without limitation, the hosting and

delivery of Content by Node Operators to the Audius Service, and the cataloging and organization of Content

by Discovery Operators on the Audius Service. The $AUDIO Token serves as the unified incentive structure

aligning the interests of the various Users, all of whom have a stake in the Audius Protocol but have different

motivations and goals. For more information, see https://audius.org/ and https://audius.org/token.



As part of creating your User Account, you will have the option to generate an $AUDIO Token wallet

(“$AUDIO Token Wallet”) with a personalized address (“$AUDIO Wallet Address”) through which you will

be able to receive and send $AUDIO Tokens or USDC on and across the Platform via your User Account on

the Audius Service. You will also have the option to connect your third-party provider e-wallet that is

compatible with WalletConnect, Walletlink, Bitski, or Phantom (for support of Solana NFTs) and any

additional e-wallet (“Third Party Wallet”) connection that we may make available to Users with an active

User Account in the future.



By connecting your Third Party Wallet you can, among other features, display your NFT Items to other Users

(for information about Solana NFTs, please read our blog post, located at

https://blog.audius.co/posts/audius-nfts-and-wallets-faq) and your $AUDIO Tokens with a VIP badge on your

profile, all as further set forth below. Currently, you must qualify for the “Silver” VIP Tier to be granted access

to the functionality via which you can link your NFT wallet(s), although this may be subject to change from

time to time via various Upgrade Proposals adopted and implemented by the Governance Protocol. With

respect to any NFT Items that you display on the Audius Service via your Third Party Wallet connection, you

hereby represent and warrant to Company that: (i) you are the sole and exclusive owner of such NFT Items,

or that you have obtained all licenses, consents, releases, and other permissions from the applicable third-

party owner(s) thereof as may be necessary to display and/or publicly perform such NFT Items on the Audius

Service, and (ii) the use and/or public performance by Company and/or any other User, Node Operator, or

sublicensee of Company does not, and will not, violate any applicable laws or the rights of any third-party,

including, without limitation, any right of publicity, right of privacy, copyright, patent, trademark, or other

intellectual property right or proprietary right.



[You own and control the digital assets held in your $AUDIO Token Wallet. With the $AUDIO Token Wallet,

the private keys (which represent the password to access the digital assets) are stored directly on your device.

At any time, subject to having internet access and the congestion on the blockchain, you may withdraw your

digital assets by sending it to a different blockchain address. When holding your digital assets in your $AUDIO

Token Wallet, Company does not maintain control over your $AUDIO Token Wallet, digital assets or private

keys. Users are responsible for the risk of loss of their private keys and seed phrases and neither $AUDIO

Token Wallet nor Company may recover such keys or seed phrases. As the owner of digital assets in your

$AUDIO Token Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. Company shall have no liability for

digital asset fluctuations or loss associated with your use of a $AUDIO Token Wallet. Company incurs no

obligation whatsoever with regard to digital assets that are not supported by Company that are sent to a

$AUDIO Token Wallet or with regard to digital assets sent to an incompatible digital asset wallet address

and/or unsupported network or blockchain. All such erroneously transmitted digital assets will be lost.



$AUDIO Token Wallet Password and Security. When setting up your $AUDIO Token Wallet, you will be

responsible for securing your own access credentials, which may include one-time passcodes associated with

your phone number, a “wallet password,” twelve-word seed phrase, “private key,” and/or other private

access information (“Wallet Password”). You understand and agree that Company cannot, and will not,

restore or recover your Wallet Password and you agree to keep your Wallet Password safe and confidential

and immediately notify Company of any unauthorized use of your $AUDIO Token Wallet or other breach of

security associated with your $AUDIO Token Wallet. Please keep in mind that Company will never have access

to this recovery phrase, so we cannot move funds on your behalf, nor can we help you access digital assets

in your $AUDIO Token Wallet should you lose your recovery phrase. We encourage you to back up your

recovery phrase using this feature, as well as writing it down and storing it in a secure location. You further

acknowledge and agree that Company will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to

comply with this section.



Peer-to-Peer Transactions. The $AUDIO Token Wallet Services enable you to send digital assets to, and

request, receive, and store digital assets from, third parties by giving instructions through the Services. Your

transfer of digital assets between your other digital asset wallets and to and from third parties is a transfer.

When you or a third party sends digital assets to your $AUDIO Token Wallet address, the person initiating

the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other

things, payment of sufficient network or miner’s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient

network fees may cause a transfer to remain in a pending state and may result in delays or loss incurred as a

result of an error in the initiation of the transaction. Company has no obligation to assist in the remediation

of such transactions. When you send cryptocurrency from your $AUDIO Token Wallet to another digital asset

wallet, such transfers are executed on chain by you and not under the control of the Company. You should

verify all transaction information prior to submitting them. Company shall bear no liability or responsibility

in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address. Transfers of digital assets cannot be

reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant cryptocurrency network, although they may be in a

pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators.

Company does not control the network and makes no guarantees that a transfer will be confirmed by the

network.]

Each Creator retains all right, title and interest in and to any NFT Items that it makes available on or through

the Audius Service via its Third Party Wallet connection; provided, that each such Creator hereby grants to

Company and its affiliates, successors, licensees, and assigns, and each Listener (and as applicable, each Node

Operator), a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, transferrable, assignable, sublicensable

(through multiple tiers) right and license to use, display, distribute, publish, and publicly perform such NFT

Items solely in connection with the Audius Service (including, without limitation, the operation thereof and

the provision of any tools, products, services, functionalities and/or features now or in the future offered

with respect to NFT Items in connection therewith), and the advertising, marketing, promotion, publicity, and

merchandizing of the Audius Service and any products and services related thereto.



For the avoidance of doubt, the above NFT Item license granted to Company covers our ability to sublicense

to, and permit, all Users of the Audius Service (and as applicable, any Node Operators) to, view, perform, and

otherwise interact with the NFT Items made available on the Audius Service by each applicable Creator in

connection with all tools, products, services, functionalities and/or features applicable to such NFT Items,

subject to the Terms of Use, and each Creator specifically acknowledges and agrees that certain rights being

granted pursuant to the above NFT Item license will be sublicensed and passed through to such other Users

(and as applicable, Node Operators).



How To Earn $AUDIO Tokens; Features and Rewards



$AUDIO Tokens may be distributed to Users in a variety of ways as set forth below, and you will have the

ability to earn $AUDIO Tokens by engaging with Content and performing other functions in connection with

the promotion of the Audius Service. One of the fundamental goals and values of the Audius Network is to

ensure that $AUDIO Tokens are being awarded and distributed to those Users who are providing the most

value to the ecosystem, as measured via various metrics tracked by the Audius Protocol. All elements of

issuance of $AUDIO Tokens may be modified and adjusted through the Governance Protocol.



Users can also use $AUDIO Tokens to unlock unique features, opportunities and Content on the Audius

Service, either by purchasing the foregoing using your $AUDIO Tokens, or by providing certain access based

on the number of $AUDIO Tokens in your $AUDIO Token Wallet.



VIP Tiers and Badges. Users are eligible for different profile badges (each a “User Badge”) correlating to

different access levels and features with respect to the Audius Service (also known as “VIP Tiers”) at different

levels of $AUDIO Token holdings. User Badges and VIP Tiers are visible throughout the Audius Service and

unlock certain social and feature benefits to Users. For example, a User Badge/VIP Tier may provide a certain

aesthetic boost to the User’s Account profile, allowing a Creator a unique way to stand out among the crowd

on the Audius Service. User Badges/VIP Tiers may also correlate to different features on the Audius Service.



User Badges and VIP Tiers will change in real time relative to $AUDIO Token holdings, meaning if a User

acquires more $AUDIO Tokens, they can be immediately upgraded to a new User Badge/VIP Tier. Conversely,

if you withdraw or otherwise lose $AUDIO Tokens from your $AUDIO Token Wallet, you can be lowered to a

lower User Badge/VIP Tier, or have your User Badge/VIP Tier removed entirely if you fall below the minimum

requirements set forth for a Bronze User Badge/VIP Tier.



The perks associated with User Badge levels and any features with respect to the Audius Service based on

your VIP Tier at any time may be modified at any time. You further acknowledge that we may be required to

change or update the foregoing as a result of future changes/updates adopted via the Governance Protocol.

For more information about the User Badge and VIP Tiers, please read our blog post, “Introducing $AUDIO

Badges”, located at https://blog.audius.co/posts/introducing-audio-badges. See also,

https://audius.org/token.



Exclusive User-Only Discord Community



Lastly, holding $AUDIO Tokens in your User Account grants you access to certain “token-permissioned” chats,

by providing you access to an exclusive channel on Company’s Discord bot which is available only to holders

of $AUDIO Tokens. This unique access provides Users with a special role in the Audius Service community.

This exclusive channel can be accessed by using the link from the Audius Service dashboard, and entering the

required code, which can be found in your User Account dashboard. This code confirms that you currently

hold at least one (1) $AUDIO Token in your User Account, allowing you to join the channel and interact with

other exclusive Users.



For more information on how to earn, receive, send, and use your $AUDIO Tokens on and across the Platform

via your User Account on the Audius Service, please see the “$AUDIO \& Rewards” link in your User Account

settings or visit the $AUDIO Token webpage at https://audius.org/token.



$AUDIO Rewards. The “$AUDIO Rewards” program allows Users to earn $AUDIO Tokens for certain

achievements relating to your Content and User Account activity. $AUDIO Tokens distributed pursuant to

the $AUDIO Rewards program may be subject to penalties or cancellation if a User is found to be abusing the

Platform, including, without limitation, by violating any of the restrictions (e.g., use of robot or automatic

process) in the section entitled Limitations on Audius Service Use. Your ability to receive $AUDIO Rewards

and any eligibility requirements therefore, the amount of $AUDIO Tokens being distributed in connection

with any element of the $AUDIO Rewards program, or the decision to stop rewarding a given action or

achievement at any time, shall be subject to, and/or may be implemented at any time by the community by

way of, the Governance Protocol.



For more information about $AUDIO Rewards, please visit the “$AUDIO \& Rewards” section of your User

Account and read our blog post, “Introducing $AUDIO Rewards”, located at

https://blog.audius.co/posts/audio-rewards. See also, https://audius.org/token.



Storage of Content on Audius Protocol and Accessibility by Third Party Services



EACH CREATOR EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT WHEN IT UPLOADS CONTENT THROUGH THE

AUDIUS SERVICE, BECAUSE SUCH CONTENT IS STORED DIRECTLY BY A CONTENT NODE OPERATOR ONTO THE

AUDIUS PROTOCOL (RATHER THAN COMPANY SERVERS), AND FORMS PART OF THE BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER OF

THE AUDIUS PROTOCOL, ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICE THAT SUBSEQUENTLY LINKS TO THE AUDIUS PROTOCOL

WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND USE SUCH CONTENT OUTSIDE OF THE AUDIUS SERVICE (EVEN IF COMPANY

HAS DE-LINKED SUCH CONTENT FROM THE AUDIUS SERVICE) AND THAT SUCH USE WILL NOT BE GOVERNED

BY THE TERMS OF USE, BUT RATHER THE API TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND/OR ANY APPLICABLE TERMS OF

USE GOVERNING SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE, IF ANY.



IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR CONTENT BEING ACCESSED AND USED BY A THIRD PARTY

SERVICE, AND/OR IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR CONTENT POTENTIALLY BEING SUBJECT TO

LICENSE GRANTS AND OTHER TERMS OF USE ESTABLISHED BY A THIRD PARTY SERVICE THAT MAY DIFFERENT

FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THESE SERVICE TERMS, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT UPLOAD YOUR CONTENT TO BE

MADE AVAILABLE ON THE AUDIUS SERVICE AND STORED BY A CONTENT NODE OPERATOR ON THE AUDIUS

PROTOCOL. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALTHOUGH COMPANY WILL USE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO

CONTACT ANY NODE OPERATOR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY UNPERMITTED USE OF OR ACCESS TO YOUR

CONTENT VIA THE AUDIUS SERVICE THAT COMPANY IS MADE AWARE OF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF USE,

COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE USE OF THE CONTENT THAT YOU CHOOSE TO UPLOAD TO THE

PLATFORM, AND COMPANY HAS NO OBLIGATION TO TAKE ACTION ON YOUR BEHALF AGAINST A THIRD

PARTY SERVICE THAT CHOOSES TO ACCESS YOUR CONTENT BY LINKING TO THE AUDIUS PROTOCOL. TO THE

EXTENT SUCH USE IS NOT PERMITTED YOU WILL HAVE TO CONTACT SUCH THIRD PARTY DIRECTLY, OR

REPORT SUCH VIOLATION TO THE GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL, AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE COMPANY FROM

ANY CLAIMS OR LIABILITY IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.



Finally, each Creator acknowledges and agrees that when a Creator elects to delete their User Account, such

Creator’s User Account will be “blocked” by Company and no longer accessible or viewable by other Users,

and any Content that has previously been uploaded or otherwise made available to other Users on the Audius

Service by such Creator will be “de-linked” or otherwise disassociated from such Creator’s User Account,

meaning such Content will no longer be searchable or accessible via the Audius Service. However, a file

reference to any Content that has previously been published on or otherwise made available to other Users

on the Audius Service by such Creator will remain on the Audius Service, and all Content files and all metadata

related thereto that has previously been uploaded through the Audius Service will remain stored on the

Audius Protocol. For further information on Company’s de-linking and deletion practices and procedures

regarding Content and/or User Account Data, please visit our Privacy Policy.



Creator Technical Requirements and Nodes



When engaging on the Audius network, a creator will be assigned a set of content nodes on the Audius

network that will host their content. For more information about becoming a Content Node Operator, see

We further reserve the right to investigate complaints and to report violations of the Terms of Use to the

any other act or omission by you that gives rise to a claim by Company.



We further reserve the right, in our sole discretion and without notice or liability to you, to instruct Node

Operators to remove, block, hide, or delete any of your Content if such Content as published or otherwise

made available by you through the Audius Service violates these Terms of Use. If we believe that your use

You may terminate the Terms of Use, which includes these Terms of Use, at any time by deleting your User

Account and ceasing all use of the Audius Service. Please note that deleting your User Account will de-link

certain Content that you’ve “liked,” uploaded, aggregated and/or curated, and Company will use good faith

efforts to cause Node Operators to remove or de-list any of your other Content or information that you’ve

Audius Protocol. However, Company does not have the ability to control whether such Node Operators

comply with any such request or to permanently delete your User Account, and the User Account Data and

other information you uploaded to the Audius Service, from the Audius Protocol. This means that metadata

and file references with respect to certain Content that you have previously uploaded as a Creator, or liked,

aggregated, or curated as a Listener, will remain on the Platform. For more information about our data

CLAIMS OF ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT ON THE PLATFORM AND THE DIGITAL

MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT

In the event of alleged infringement of any party’s copyright with respect to any Content published or actions

taken on or through the Platform by Creators, Company’s liability is limited as a transitory digital network

communication service provider under the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (i.e., Title II

of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512 [the “DMCA”], as amended from time to time).



Company acts as an intermediary service provider that transmits, routes, and provides connections for

Content and other Creator-generated material made available to Listeners on the Audius Service via an

automatic technical process through the AudSP decentralized storage protocol at the direction of Creators

and non-Audius parties, without selecting, filtering, approving or denying, or modifying such materials or

intended recipients as sent or received by those uploaders, transmitters, etc. All Content uploaded by a

Creator and/or accessed by a Listener via the Audius Service is stored directly on, and called via a link from,

the Audius Protocol and related blockchain ledger and Company does not create or maintain any copies of

any such Content and other Creator-generated materials, which may be made in the course of its

intermediate or transient storage, on Audius-owned or controlled systems or networks (including such

systems or networks that host the Audius Service) in a manner ordinarily accessible to anyone other than

anticipated recipients and for a longer period than is reasonably necessary for the transmission, routing, or

provision of connections.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the governance rules of the Audius Protocol, all Content Node

Operators are required to become registered agents under the DMCA and otherwise comply with all other

terms and conditions of § 512(c) thereof as a condition to becoming, and requirement to remaining, a

Content Node Operator of the Audius Protocol; provided, however, that Company disclaims any and all

liability regarding any Content Node Operator’s failure to become a registered agent under the DMCA or to

otherwise comply with all other terms and conditions of § 512(c) thereof.



Pursuant to the above, while Company has no direct ability itself to remove any allegedly infringing Content

from the Audius Protocol, it does respect the intellectual property rights of others and expects all Users to

do the same and reserves the right to take any actions that it deems appropriate and that are within its

control to protect against copyright infringement on the Audius Service. Therefore, notwithstanding the

foregoing, and in full reservation of Company’s rights as a transitory digital network communication service

provider under the DMCA and all other rights available to Company under applicable law and in equity, if you

believe in good faith that Content is being linked to, and made available on, the Audius Service in a manner

that infringes upon your copyright and are otherwise unsuccessful in causing the applicable Creator or

Content Node Operator to remove such Content directly, you may send Company a notice to

dmca@audius.co with the below information, and upon receipt of such notice, Company will (i) de-link the

allegedly infringing Content identified in such notice from the Audius Service and/or use commercially

reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Creator who originally uploaded such Content to de-link such

Content from the Audius Service solely by using the “delete” Content functionality in such Creator’s account

settings, and/or (ii) use good faith efforts to notify the applicable Content Node Operators storing such

allegedly infringing Content of its receipt of such notice and reasonably request that such applicable Content

Node Operators delete such Content from their respective servers on the Audius Protocol; provided,

however, Company shall have no liability if such Content Node Operator fails to take the requested action.



• Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;



• A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed and an explanation as to

why you think an infringement has taken place;

• A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Audius Service,

sufficient for Company to locate the material (e.g., the URL);



• A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted work is not authorized

by the copyright owner, its agent, or applicable law;



• A statement by you under penalty of perjury under applicable law that the information in your notice

is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf; and



• Your electronic or physical signature.



United States law imposes substantial penalties for falsely submitting a notice of copyright infringement.



Company may notify each Creator from time to time that it has received a third party notice of alleged

copyright infringement with respect to certain Content that such Creator may have published or otherwise

made available on or through the Audius Service and request that such Creator to de-link such Content from

the Audius Service using the “delete” Content functionality in your User settings and each Creator agrees to

promptly comply with any such requests in good faith. Each Creator further acknowledges and agrees that

Company may directly de-link Content that such Creator may have published or otherwise made available on

or through the Audius Service from the Audius Service upon its receipt of a third party notice of alleged

copyright infringement with respect to such Content, with or without prior notice to such Creator, and in

appropriate circumstances, that Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to de-link each Creator’s

entire User Account if such Creator is determined to have engaged in repeated instances of copyright

infringement on the Audius Service.



If you believe that your Content has been de-linked by mistake or misidentification, you may send us a

counter-notice to dmca@audius.co containing the following information:



• Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;



• A description of the material that was de-linked;



• A description of where on the Audius Service the material that was de-linked previously appeared

(e.g., URL);



• A statement that you have a good faith belief that the material was de-linked as a result of a mistake

or misidentification;



• A statement by you under penalty of perjury under applicable law that the information in your

counter-notice is accurate;



• A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the judicial district in

which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, the Central District

of California, and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA

notice or an agent of that person; and



• Your electronic or physical signature.



REPEAT INFRINGERS AND “3 STRIKE” POLICY



Node Operators operate a system whereby Users are given “strikes” for Content that violates Company’s

policies pertaining to the infringement of copyright and other intellectual property of third parties contained

in these Terms of Service, if you get a copyright or intellectual property strike, this means that the owner of

that property and/or intellectual property submitted a valid takedown request as provided in these Terms of

Service



Content can only have one strike at a time. Please also note that Content can be removed from the Audius

Service for reasons other than copyright or intellectual property infringement.



You hereby acknowledge and agree that Company has no responsibility for the implementation, enforcement

and/or changes to its policy pertaining to the infringement of copyright and other intellectual property of

third parties. You further acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to cause Node Operators to

implement current policies pertaining to such infringing activities, or any other actions or inactions of any

Node Operator(s).



For more information regarding the Governance Protocol and the Node Operators that provide Content-

related services for the Platform, see the FAQ.



What Happens When You Receive a Strike?



When you get a strike, you are notified via your User Account and/or via email. We and/or a Node Operator

will let you know which of your Content was removed, which policies from the Terms of Use and/or Terms of

Use were violated, and next steps you can take to address this.



Strikes may affect your ability to monetize your Content. If you get three (3) strikes, your User Account is

subject to immediate permanent or temporary de-linking/disabling your User Account, and any Content that

you have uploaded and will upload via the Audius Service is subject to immediate permanent or temporary

de-linking. In order to reinstate your User Account and your Content, you will need to take and pass the

Audius Copyright Infringement Quiz, which helps Users understand intellectual property and how it’s

enforced by Node Operators.



If you are a Verified Artist Account (defined below), after 3 strikes, you will have 7 days to act before your

User Account is de-linked/disabled. During this period, your strikes will not expire and you will not be able to

upload new Content, but your User Account will remain live. If you submit a counter notification, your User

Account will not be disabled while the counter notification is unresolved. If the counter notification is

resolved in your favor, or the claim is retracted, your User Account will not be impacted. “Verified Artist

Account”means a User Account where the User has been verified as an artist according to Company’s

guidelines, as well as the policies of rightsholders (e.g., record labels) and other third parties (e.g., brands)

whose rights, titles or interests are implicated by such verification.



At the sole discretion of Node Operators, prior to receiving a strike, you may get only a warning for a violation

of the Terms of Use. Sometimes an individual case of severe abuse of the Terms of Use may result in the

immediate de-linking/disabling (on a permanent or temporary, at the sole discretion of Node Operators) of

your User Account and any Content that you have uploaded via the Audius Service, without any warning to

you,.



Resolving a Strike



There are three ways to resolve a strike given against a User Account:

A. Expiration: strikes expire after ninety (90) days provided that you receive no additional strikes in

that period and complete and pass the Audius Copyright Infringement Quiz if it was your third strike.



B. Retraction: you can contact the person who claimed your Content was infringing and request them

to retract their claim.



C. Counternotification: if your Content was claimed as infringing by mistake or qualifies as fair use,

you can submit a counternotification as provided in this Terms of Service.



You may not use another account to circumvent any restrictions made to your User Account due to a strike,

and Company reserves the right to terminate, or cause Node Operators to terminate, your User Account

and/or restrict your access to the Audius Service for any violation of the foregoing in its sole discretion.

GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION



Governing Law. The Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the

State of Nevada, without reference to principles of conflicts of laws.



Disputes. You and Company agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the

Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the

Platform, including, without limitation, any Content contained thereon or use of $AUDIO Tokens in

connection therewith (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party

retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other

equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,

misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual

property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by

jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.

Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more

than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative

proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution;

Arbitration" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute

Resolution" section will survive any termination of the Terms of Use.

Arbitration Rules. THIS SECTION PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING

ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. All disputes

arising under or relating to the Terms of Use or to your use (or inability to use) of the Platform shall be settled

by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules

and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“Supplementary Procedures”), as amended

by the terms of the Terms of Use. The Supplementary Procedures are available online at www.adr.org. To

the extent that the arbitrator deems reasonable, the arbitrator may conduct hearings, if any, by

teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances. Any in-person appearances

requested by the arbitrator shall be held in Clark County in the State Nevada. The arbitrator’s decision shall

be based upon the substantive laws of the State of Nevada without regard to its principles of conflicts of law.

Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English and shall be conducted in a manner that preserves

confidentiality. The arbitrator’s decision shall follow the plain meaning of the relevant documents and shall

be final and binding. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be confirmed and enforced in any court

having jurisdiction thereof. The foregoing shall not preclude Company from seeking any injunctive relief in

U.S. state or federal courts for protection of its intellectual property rights (including the rights of its

licensors), and you agree to exclusive jurisdiction by the federal and state courts located in Clark County in

FEEDBACK



While our own staff is continually working to develop and evaluate our own product ideas and features, we

pride ourselves on paying close attention to the interests, feedback, comments, and suggestions we receive

from the User community. If you choose to contribute by sending us or our employees any ideas for services,

features, modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies, content offerings, promotions,

strategies, or product/feature names, or any related documentation, artwork, computer code, diagrams, or

other materials (collectively, “Feedback”), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may

say, the following terms will apply, so that future misunderstandings can be avoided. Accordingly, by sending

us Feedback, you agree that: (i) Company has no obligation to review, consider, or implement your Feedback,

or to return to you all or part of any Feedback for any reason; (ii) Feedback is provided on a non-confidential

basis, and Company is not under any obligation to keep any Feedback you send confidential or to refrain from

using or disclosing it in any way; and (iii) you irrevocably grant Company a perpetual and unlimited permission

to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, modify, publicly perform (including on a through-to-the-

audience basis), communicate to the public, make available, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit

the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without

attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and promoting

commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback, whether in whole or in part, and

whether as provided or as modified.
