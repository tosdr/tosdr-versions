By (i) signing-up for a membership, service or a subscription, (ii) using this product with online functionality, this web site ( “Site”) or other online service of Corel Corporation, its affiliates and agents (“Corel”) with links to these Terms of Use (the “General Terms”) (collectively, the “Services”) in any way, including using, transmitting, downloading or uploading any Materials (as defined below) made available or enabled via the Services by Corel , or (iii) merely browsing the Services, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to these General Terms and the Corel Online Privacy Policy at [https://www.corel.com/privacy](https://www.corel.com/privacy), which is incorporated herein by reference. “Materials” means any content made available or enabled by Corel or its licensors, and includes, without limitation, any information, data, documents, images, photographs, graphics, audio, videos, or webcasts, products, and Corel software code and associated documentation (“Software”).

b. You may not use the Services if you are prohibited by Law (as defined below in Section 2(c)) from receiving or using the Services.

In particular, unless expressly stated in the Additional Terms for any given Service, you affirm that you are over the age of 13 and acknowledge that these Services were not intended for children under 13.

c. Corel makes certain Services and Materials available only if you have paid a fee in addition to a software license fee or have provided Corel certain registration information and/or created a Corel.com account with ID and password or other log-in ID and password (collectively, “Account Information”). Some Services may also be subject to a subscription or other agreement, posted guidelines, rules, or terms of service (“Additional Terms”). If there is any conflict between the General Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms take precedence in relation to that Service. The General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and all other documents incorporated by reference in these General Terms are referred to herein as the “Terms”.

d. Corel may change the Terms from time to time at its sole discretion, including by imposing a charge for access to or use of a Service. If such changes are made, Corel will make a new copy of the General Terms available at [https://www.corel.com/tos](https://www.corel.com/tos), with any new Additional Terms made available to you from within or through the affected Service. Corel may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Services is permitted. Otherwise, your continued use of any affected Service constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Your use of the Services is subject to the most current version of the Terms posted on or through the affected Service at the time of such use. It is your responsibility to regularly check [https://www.corel.com/tos](https://www.corel.com/tos) to review the current General Terms and Addition Terms.

b. You agree that your Account Information will always be complete, accurate and up-to-date. It is your responsibility to keep your Account Information confidential at all times and you are solely responsible for all activity that occurs to your Account Information when you are logged in to your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or Account Information, or any other breach of security, you agree to notify Corel immediately. You may not use another person's Account Information. Corel may require that you change your Account Information or certain parts of your Account Information at any time for any reason.

c.

e.

### 3\. Ownership.

a. The Services and Materials, and their selection and arrangement, are protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, trade secret, unfair competition, and other intellectual and proprietary rights (the “Intellectual Property Rights”). Except as expressly provided in the Terms, Corel and its suppliers do not grant any express or implied rights to use the Services and Materials.

b. The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Services (the “Marks”) are the property of Corel or third parties.

### 4\. Use of Software.

Any Software that is made available via the Services is the property of Corel and its licensors and suppliers. If the Software made available via the Services is accompanied by license terms, then use of such Software is governed by the terms of such license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the hyperlinks referenced in the Software. Some license terms are available for review at https://www.corel.com/eula. Other license terms may only be posted with the Software downloads or at the web page where the Software can be accessed. You shall not use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license agreement. Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the license agreement provided with such Software, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that Software; except only that if the Software is a pre-release version, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the Software for any commercial or production purposes.

All User Content is your sole responsibility. Corel has, except as otherwise set forth herein, no ownership or control over any User Content. You are responsible for protecting any intellectual property rights in User Content, and Corel shall not have any responsibility for protecting them.

You hereby warrant that any and all of your User Content shall be wholly-owned by you, shall not infringe on the intellectual property or other rights of any other person or entity and shall comply with all intellectual property and similar laws. You further warrant that any such User Content shall not contain any elements which may reasonably be considered offensive or immoral, or which would violate applicable laws, rules or regulations. You further warrant that you shall not upload any User Content which contains any elements which may be dangerous or harmful to Corel other users, or any of such parties' hardware, servers or software.

a. THE SITE, SERVICES AND MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED BY COREL “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 12\. Limitation of Liability.

a. IN NO EVENT SHALL COREL, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE OR IF COREL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR MATERIALS.

The parties hereby confirm that it is their wish that this Agreement, as well as all other documents relating hereto, including all notices, have been and shall be drawn up in the English language. The parties specifically disclaim the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

b. All claims you bring against Corel must be resolved in accordance with this section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this section, Corel may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to U.S. $5,000, provided that Corel has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to properly withdraw the claim.

c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your or others' unauthorized access to or use of the Services or Materials in violation of the Terms you agree that Corel shall be entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

### 16\. General.

a. Any notice provided to Corel pursuant to the Terms should be sent to 1600 Carling Avenue, Ottawa, Ontario K1Z 8R7, Attention: General Counsel.

c. Corel may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, text message, postings on or within the Services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed.

d. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between Corel and you with respect to your access to or use of the Services and Materials and supersede any prior agreements between you and Corel on such subject matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corel End User License Agreement, the latest version of which is available at [https://www.corel.com/eula](https://www.corel.com/eula), shall also form part of this Agreement to the extent it is herein referenced, provided that in the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Corel End User License Agreement, the Corel End User License Agreement shall control, including but not limited to your rights and responsibilities for use of the Software.

e. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms, or any right granted hereunder, without Corel's written consent. Corel's rights under the Terms are freely transferable by Corel.

f. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect.

g. Any failure by Corel to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms, or any related right, shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or right.
