b. You may not use the Services if you are prohibited by Law (as defined below in Section 2(c)) from receiving or using the Services.

Some Services may also be subject to a subscription or other agreement, posted guidelines, rules, or terms of service (“Additional Terms”). If there is any conflict between the General Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms take precedence in relation to that Service. The General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and all other documents incorporated by reference in these General Terms are referred to herein as the “Terms”.

d. Corel may change the Terms from time to time at its sole discretion, including by imposing a charge for access to or use of a Service. If such changes are made, Corel will make a new copy of the General Terms available at [https://www.corel.com/tos](https://www.corel.com/tos), with any new Additional Terms made available to you from within or through the affected Service. Corel may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Services is permitted. Otherwise, your continued use of any affected Service constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Your use of the Services is subject to the most current version of the Terms posted on or through the affected Service at the time of such use. It is your responsibility to regularly check [https://www.corel.com/tos](https://www.corel.com/tos) to review the current General Terms and Addition Terms.

b. You agree that your Account Information will always be complete, accurate and up-to-date. It is your responsibility to keep your Account Information confidential at all times and you are solely responsible for all activity that occurs to your Account Information when you are logged in to your account.

You may not use another person's Account Information. Corel may require that you change your Account Information or certain parts of your Account Information at any time for any reason.

c.

### 3\. Ownership.

a. The Services and Materials, and their selection and arrangement, are protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, trade secret, unfair competition, and other intellectual and proprietary rights (the “Intellectual Property Rights”).

### 4\. Use of Software.

Any Software that is made available via the Services is the property of Corel and its licensors and suppliers. If the Software made available via the Services is accompanied by license terms, then use of such Software is governed by the terms of such license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the hyperlinks referenced in the Software. Some license terms are available for review at https://www.corel.com/eula. Other license terms may only be posted with the Software downloads or at the web page where the Software can be accessed. You shall not use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license agreement. Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the license agreement provided with such Software, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that Software; except only that if the Software is a pre-release version, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the Software for any commercial or production purposes.

You hereby warrant that any and all of your User Content shall be wholly-owned by you, shall not infringe on the intellectual property or other rights of any other person or entity and shall comply with all intellectual property and similar laws.

a. THE SITE, SERVICES AND MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED BY COREL “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 12\. Limitation of Liability.

a. IN NO EVENT SHALL COREL, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE OR IF COREL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR MATERIALS.

The parties specifically disclaim the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

c. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your or others' unauthorized access to or use of the Services or Materials in violation of the Terms you agree that Corel shall be entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

### 16\. General.

c. Corel may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, text message, postings on or within the Services, or other reasonable means now known or hereafter developed.

d. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between Corel and you with respect to your access to or use of the Services and Materials and supersede any prior agreements between you and Corel on such subject matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corel End User License Agreement, the latest version of which is available at [https://www.corel.com/eula](https://www.corel.com/eula), shall also form part of this Agreement to the extent it is herein referenced, provided that in the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Corel End User License Agreement, the Corel End User License Agreement shall control, including but not limited to your rights and responsibilities for use of the Software.

e. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms, or any right granted hereunder, without Corel's written consent. Corel's rights under the Terms are freely transferable by Corel.

f. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect.

g. Any failure by Corel to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms, or any related right, shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or right.
