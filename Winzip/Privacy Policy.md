### 2\. Disclosing Personal Data to Third Parties

We treat your Personal Data with care and confidentially and will only pass it on to third parties to the extent described below and not beyond.

We do not sell, rent, or trade Personal Data in the traditional sense (i.e., in exchange for payment). Certain U.S. state privacy laws define the term “sale” broadly to encompass some of our data processing activities, outlined in the “Information for Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia” section in this Privacy Statement.

Where our affiliates, resellers, or service providers process Personal Data, they will do so solely on our instructions and have undertaken to comply with strict contractual requirements for the security of your data (including, but not limited to, complying with this Privacy Statement).

**Third Party Services:** If you use a Third Party Service such as Apple, Facebook or Google to create a new or sign in to an existing account when visiting our Sites or using our Products, some of your Personal Data such as IP address of your device, your broad geographical location (country, state (if applicable), and city) and the type of the account you sign up for/login to becomes indirectly known to that Third Party Service.

**Affiliated Companies:** Alludo has affiliates located worldwide, including in the USA, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Malta, Estonia, Mauritius, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Taiwan. We share data with our affiliates in the ordinary course of our business for administrative purposes and efficiency. For an overview of our affiliates, as well as their mailing addresses, please refer to [https://www.alludo.com/en/legal/affiliated-companies/](https://www.winzip.com/en/legal/affiliated-companies/). All Alludo affiliates have signed the inter-company data transfer agreement incorporating Standard Contractual Clauses of the EU Commission, to ensure protection of your data within the Alludo Group.

**Service Providers:** Alludo transmits data to service providers that enable us to provide our Site and market, sell, and deliver our Products and host our services. This includes the parties providing our third-party cookies and tracking tools, as well as parties providing us with services to assist us in processing transactions, including credit card transactions, handling shipping and processing of orders, providing customer support, managing customer relationships (like Saleforce.com), hosting the Sites (like Amazon Web Services), hosting our Cloud Services (like Azure), performing analysis of our Sites or Products (such as Google or AWS warehouse services). We occasionally also disclose Personal Data to independent auditors acting on our behalf, for anti-piracy or revenue accounting purposes in connection with the internal operations of our business. We sometimes need to disclose your information to these companies in order for them to provide the applicable services.

**Document/File Hosting Providers:** The following information is only collected when using optional features in Alludo’s WinZip software product: For user-initiated file and file link sharing and storage using email, social media, instant messaging and cloud services, login information is requested. For user-initiated file sharing via email, social media, and instant messaging optional contact information can be requested and saved so that it can be accessed for future use by the customer. This data is not shared with third parties for any purpose. This information is only stored locally, on your PC or other computing device.

Some of the Products (like Parallels Desktop and our cloud service offerings) allow you to connect your cloud storage account (such as Azure, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, and Apple iCloud Drive). If you do so, the Product may collect the information about the type of cloud storage you use, as well as information around your organization, such as your organization profile information, your organization name/ID, and the name of your environment. But we neither collect nor share with third parties for any purposes your cloud storage account credentials and your files stored in there.

**Business Transactions:** In the event Alludo goes through a business transaction such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets to which this Privacy Statement relates, we may disclose or transfer your information to a third party in connection with or during negotiation of such a transaction.

**Public Authorities:** Although we make every effort to preserve customer privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, such as when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, litigation, or other legal processes or actions (whether or not initiated by Alludo) to protect Alludo's, our users' or third parties' rights, property or safety. We will transmit data to public authorities such as law enforcement or tax authorities only in the case of a legal obligation to do so based on a request for information from the respective authority.

### 3\. Retention of Personal Data

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we typically retain Personal Data we obtain about you for as long as it is needed (1) for the purposes for which we obtained it, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement, which generally means that we will keep your Personal Data for the duration of our relationship or as long as you keep your account open with us; or (2) to take into account applicable statute of limitation periods and comply with applicable laws, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. You may request that we delete your information or restrict the processing of such information by contacting us as indicated in Section 13 of this Privacy Statement.

#### Our Legal Basis for Processing

Alludo primarily processes data as a controller, for the purposes explained above under Sections 1 and 2 of this Privacy Statement. These purposes represent our legitimate interests. At the same time, some of the Personal Data we process is necessary for us to perform a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. For example, if you express your interest in purchasing one of our Products, such as by filling out a webform, we will process the Personal Data submitted to comply with your request. This may include sharing your Personal Data with one of our authorized resellers, who will then use your Personal Data to complete the purchase transaction. In addition, we are legally obliged to provide certain information to criminal prosecution or tax authorities in individual cases upon request. In these cases, the legal basis for the processing is either legal requirements or reasons of public interest. Where we process your Personal Data with your explicit consent, this declaration of consent will be the legal basis for processing your Personal Data.

In certain cases, your personal data may be transferred to countries outside of Europe. Alludo ensures that such transfer will be carried out in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.
