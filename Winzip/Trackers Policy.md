Cookie Notice

#### Introduction

This document describes how Cascade Parent Limited trading as Alludo (collectively “us” and “we”) use cookies and other similar industry standard information-gathering tools (collectively “cookies”) on our corporate and product websites (“Websites”). This information supplements our Privacy Statement.

Consenting to the use of cookies on one of our Websites does not grant consent or change consent preferences on additional Websites.

#### What are Cookies and why do we use them?

We use cookies on our Websites for a variety of useful purposes. For instance, we use cookies to collect information about your use and interaction with our Websites, to analyze web traffic, adapt services, content, and advertisements, to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, to distinguish one user from another, and to promote the confidence in and security of our Websites. This helps us to obtain the feedback required for constantly improving our Websites and to better serve our users.

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for the duration of a single visit to a Website. They disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies stay on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer or device.  The table below describes the different types of cookies used by us on our Websites and your options for managing your devices’ cookie settings:

| **Type of Cookie** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Essential cookie | These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. |
| Performance cookie | These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. |
| Functionality cookie | These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. |
| Targeting cookie | These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. |

#### How can I control Cookies?

If you would like to change your user settings in order to change how we process information related to your interaction with our Websites, you can do so at any point in time by accessing our consent management solution located in the footer of our Websites There you can grant or revoke your consent to use of cookies for non-essential purposes and you can view the exact domain and lifespan for each cookie or other tracking mechanism.

Because cookies are stored on your own computer or device, you are always free to set your browser to decline them and you can delete them from your device. However, if you do so, you may find that some web pages do not work smoothly or that your ability to use certain features or functions of our Websites may be limited.

To learn more about how to control cookies using your browser settings [click here](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

On our Websites, we use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, which use cookies about your use of our Websites that is generally sent to and stored on a Google server in the USA. Within the EU, your IP address will be shortened by Google on our websites, before being sent to Google’s servers. For this purpose, we have implemented Google supported ways to anonymize collection of IP addresses. You can prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie related to your use of our Websites by Google, as well as the processing of these data by Google, by accessing our consent management solution or downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

For more information on Google’s terms of use and data protection, visit [https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and [https://privacy.google.com/#](https://privacy.google.com/#).

We use Google AdWords & Google Remarketing-related cookies to allow users who have already visited our Websites and are interested in our products to be addressed again through targeted advertising on the pages of the Google partner network. We also utilize DoubleClick Digital Marketing (a Google product) for digital marketing purposes. You can disable Google's use of cookies for these purposes by visiting [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/). Both services are subject to the Google privacy policy available at [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

We use Bing Ads cookies, which enable Microsoft to track your usage across multiple devices in order to display personalized advertising on or in Microsoft web pages and apps. You can disable this behavior at [http://choice.microsoft.com/opt-out](http://choice.microsoft.com/opt-out). For more information about Bing's analytics services, visit Bing Ads at[https://help.ads.microsoft.com](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/).

To learn more about the above and other advertising networks and your ability to opt out of collection by a particular third party, please visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, [here](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1), and the Digital Advertising Alliance, [here](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

#### Transfers to third party countries

If you consent to the use of cookies, you also consent to the transfer of your personal data to third countries, such as the USA, which may not provide a level of data protection identical with the privacy standards in your location. In the case of certain providers, such as Google and Bing, we have put in place all guarantees available to us, to compensate for this deficit. However, there is a risk that government agencies may access your personal data as a result of the transfer, without you having effective legal remedies in this regard.
