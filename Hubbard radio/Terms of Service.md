Notwithstanding the foregoing, by using the Site, you further agree to abide by and be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service.

**Intellectual Property.** You acknowledge that all content and materials available at the Site (collectively, the “Content”) are protected by national and international copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, patent registration rights, trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary rights and laws and, as between Operator and you, are owned exclusively by Operator. Except where otherwise noted, you may download, print or view individual pages at the Site for private, noncommercial use, provided you do not delete, change or otherwise modify any of the Content, including, but not limited to, any copyright or trademark notices. You may only use the Site and the Content as expressly permitted herein and for no other purpose. Except as authorized by Operator in writing on a case by case basis, you will not sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any of the Content. The systematic retrieval of any of the Content to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory without the written permission of Operator is prohibited. Unless otherwise indicated, all logos, names, package designs and marks on the Site are trademarks or service marks and may not be used without permission. Operator’s policy is to terminate the online privileges of individuals who repeatedly violate the copyrights of others.

**User’s Grant of Limited License.** By posting or submitting any content or other materials to the Site (collectively, the “User Content”), you grant Operator and its designees the right to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from the User Content in any form, anywhere and for any purpose.

If any provision hereof is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

**Unauthorized Use and Termination.** You agree to use the Site only for authorized and legal activities. Operator reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Site at any time and for any or no reason.
