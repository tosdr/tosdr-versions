The websites and third-party content to which we link may have separate privacy notices or policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these websites.

If you provide any personal information through a third-party site, your interaction and your personal information will be collected by and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party site. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties, which are not governed by this Privacy Policy.

**Advertising and Opt-Out Disclosures**

Google/YouTube

Our website uses Google Analytics to measure the performance of the Site and our ads. Please see [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners) to find out more about how Google uses your information.

We also use YouTube’s (a Google affiliate) application interface (API) on our Platform to allow you to retrieve and view videos hosted by YouTube while you are on our Platforms.  Videos retrieved through the YouTube API may contain ads. While we do not collect, use, or share personal information collected in connection with the YouTube API, YouTube may collect personal information from you when you interact with the vides they host. For more information about how Google handles your information. Please see www.google.com/policies/privacy.

Other Third-Party Ad Partners

When you use our Platforms our third-party advertising partners, social media providers, and analytics providers may collect personal information about your online activity on our Platforms and on third party websites.

These providers may set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons, as discussed further below) to collect information regarding your online activity. In addition, our advertising partners may use this information to deliver advertisements to you when you visit third party websites within their networks. If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices with respect to it, please either visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page (currently available at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)) or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page (currently available at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)). Please note that you may continue to receive generic ads that are not based on your preferences.

**Information Security**

We use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures designed to safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet cannot be guaranteed. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting personal information over the internet. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your information; therefore, when submitting personal information to us, you do so at your own risk.

**Cookies and Similar Technology**

We and our partners use various tools to collect data when you visit our Platforms, including cookies, pixels, localStorage, and other similar technologies. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Our Platforms use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or mobile application can access personal information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Platform. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Platforms, such as pages you have visited, other content you viewed, and search history.

We and our partners may also use these technologies to gather personal information about how you view and use our Platforms and content and to connect your activity with other data we store about you. We and our partners may collect your personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Platforms. The use of these technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, tracking trends, measuring the effectiveness of ads, saving your preferences, and storing information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Our partners may collect data from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own similar tools.

Your web browser can be set to allow you to control these technologies, such as whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your browser. If your browser is set to reject cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser may tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting these technologies, such as cookies. To find out more about cookies, visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). Depending on the make and model of your phone, you may be able to use device settings to opt out of the use of certain device IDs for targeted advertising.

Some browsers permit the user to send a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) preference to websites that the user visits indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked over time and across websites. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT, we do not currently respond to the DNT signal on our websites.

In addition, if you give your email address to us, we may use a scrambled form (called a “hashed” version) of your email address to deliver tailored ads to you on our Platforms or on other websites, including via Custom Audience Feature or other similar tools.

**Your Marketing Preferences**

We may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our Platforms. If you no longer wish to receive promotional marketing materials from us, you may opt out of receiving such materials. You may unsubscribe from receiving marketing or other commercial emails from us by following the instructions included in the email. Please allow time for your request to be implemented.

You may unsubscribe from text messages you previously consented to by following the prompt provided on our messages. We will work to comply with your request promptly.

There are certain service notifications and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt out of, such as notifications of changes to our Platforms or policies.
