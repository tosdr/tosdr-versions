This Privacy Policy will apply in those circumstances.

**_Solicited Information_**

**_Unsolicited Information_**

If RDC Media receives personal information about an individual in circumstances where it did not solicit the information, RDC Media will (within a reasonable period after receiving the information) determine whether or not it would have been entitled to collect such information having regard to its functions and activities. If RDC Media determines that it is not entitled to such information, RDC Media will destroy the information or ensure that the information is de-identified.

* genetic information.

RDC Media will not collect sensitive information unless the individual has consented to the collection of that information or the collection is required or authorised by law.

**_What if you don't provide us with your personal information?_**

The nature of the business carried on by RDC Media means that, generally, it is not possible for us to provide services to you anonymously. However, in some circumstances, we allow individuals the option of not identifying themselves, or of using a pseudonym, when dealing with us, for example, where you write to a RDC Media publication or where you post on the Website.

If you do not provide us with your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with certain products and/or services, as certain products, services and features are reserved for subscribers of the Racing.com platform (referred to as Racing+ subscribers).

In some circumstances, a fee may apply.

RDC Media will endeavour to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information it holds is accurate, up to date and complete. If the information held by RDC Media is inaccurate, incomplete or not up to date, the individual may request that RDC Media correct the information.

There are some circumstances in which RDC Media is entitled to deny a person access to information, in part or full.  These include, amongst others, circumstances where:

* giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within RDC Media in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process;
* giving access would be likely to prejudice one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of an enforcement body;
* giving access would be unlawful (for example, if providing the information would amount to a breach of legal professional privilege or a breach of confidence); or
* denying access is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order.

If any request for access to information is to be denied in part or full or not provided in the manner requested by an individual, RDC Media will give the individual a written notice, setting out, amongst others, the reasons for the refusal except to the extent that, having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be unreasonable to do so.

RDC Media may collect personal information from an individual in the course of an individual’s visit to a Website or RDC App, or where an individual inputs personal information, which includes but is not limited to situations where a person:

* signs up for a R+ account;
* signs up to receive certain communications such as a newsletter, or changes their marketing preferences; or
* enters a competition or participates in a promotion.

In addition, RDC Media also places, uses and reads first-party and third-party cookies and advertising identifiers for mobile devices when you visit a Website or RDC App. Cookies are small files that are used to store small pieces of information – these files are stored on your device (not our systems) when you visit a Website or RDC App from your browser, whether you are logged in or not.

There are four types of cookies which we use, being:

* _Performance_ _or functional cookies_: these cookies are used to provide enhanced functionality and make our Websites / RDC App easier to use (for example, by remembering your login details or location).
* _Analytics_ _cookies_: these cookies are used to generate user statistics (for example, how many people have visited a Website, or a particular page of a Website, the average session length of a user and how many repeat visitors our Websites receive) and help us to create a Website / RDC App that best suits the needs of our users. For example, if the “racing calendar” is the most popular page, we can make sure it is easily accessible from the homepage.
* _Marketing_ _or advertising cookies_: these cookies are used to deliver personalised content or advertising to you in line with your interests. For example, if you have shown an interest in race meetings at a particular racecourse, or in a particular trainer, we may deliver content relevant to that racecourse or trainer. This could be delivered to you in various forms, such as personalised home page content, welcome screens or pop ups.

RDC Media also uses a third party service, Google Analytics, which may also provide us with information about you, such as your IP address, location, gender, age bracket, language and interests based on your interaction with Google platforms. If you would like more information regarding how Google uses data, please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) (this link may be amended by Google from time to time, so if this link isn’t working please contact us (refer below) or search “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services").

The purposes for which RDC Media collects personal information from users of its Websites and RDC App, including via the use of cookies and Google Analytics, include:

* providing our users with the best service experience possible on our Websites / RDC App (such as improving functionality);
* helping us understand and analyse how our Websites / RDC App are performing, and which content is of most interest to our users;
* delivering personalised content (including advertising) to our users based on their interests;
* conducting competitions and promotions; and
* providing services related to the thoroughbred racing industry such as circulation ofnewsletters and industry related news.

If a person does not wish to receive cookies (other than strictly necessary cookies), you may set your browser to either prompt or refuse cookies, and you can also delete existing cookies via your browser settings. Different browsers provide different methods to block and delete cookies used by websites. To find out more about how to manage and delete cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
