* an individual’s name or address;
* bank account details and credit card information; or

RDC Media will not collect personal information unless collection of such information is reasonably necessary to enable RDC Media to carry out one or more of its functions and/or activities.

We are generally exempt from the Privacy Act when we handle employee records, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to that information. However, where State or Territory health privacy legislation applies, we are still required to protect the privacy of employee health information. This Privacy Policy will apply in those circumstances.

**_Solicited Information_**

RDC Media holds and uses personal information about its suppliers, customers, Website users and subscribers. Typically, this information includes a person's name, email address, phone number, address, date of birth, gender and any other required information.

This information is needed to maintain RDC Media's records in a format that identifies the person. These records are held by RDC Media for the purposes of enabling RDC Media to:

* provide goods and/or services to its customers, including subscriptions, news, communications (including publications and newsletters) and process the purchase of products / memorabilia;
* conduct competitions or promotions;
* measure and improve the services and features of the Website in order to provide the individual with the best service experience possible on the Website;
* promoting the thoroughbred racing industry;
* engage suppliers; and
* otherwise perform its functions and activities as outlined above.

RDC Media collects personal information only by lawful and fair means. Information is collected from the individual unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so. This is generally directly from an individual in the course of their visit to the Website and includes but is not limited to, situations where an individual inputs personal information to: 

* register to become a subscriber to any of RDC Media’s businesses including to Racing+, Best Bets, Racing Photos, form guides, newsletters and/or communications;
* submit a purchase order for RDC Media’s products/goods;
* submit general enquiries or feedback;
* submit job applications;
* submit of entries into competitions for which RDC Media is the promoter; and

* your image, where we are photographing your participation or attendance at a race meeting;
* from race results, licensed participant profiles, articles or other resources on other websites;
* when someone provides your personal information to us on your behalf, such as when submitting a letter to the editor in Winning Post or making a complaint;
* from third parties including Racing Australia and Racing Victoria;
* through social networking sites such as LinkedIn or Facebook or from your professional reference where you are applying for employment at RDC Media;
* if authorised or required by law;
* with your consent; or
* as otherwise required to enable RDC Media to fulfill it functions and activities as outlined in Section 3.

**_Unsolicited Information_**

If RDC Media receives personal information about an individual in circumstances where it did not solicit the information, RDC Media will (within a reasonable period after receiving the information) determine whether or not it would have been entitled to collect such information having regard to its functions and activities. If RDC Media determines that it is not entitled to such information, RDC Media will destroy the information or ensure that the information is de-identified.

**_Sensitive Information_**

Sensitive information is a subset of personal information that is generally afforded a higher level of privacy protection. Examples include information about an individual’s:

* racial or ethnic origin;
* health or medical information;
* membership of a political association, professional or trade association or trade union;
* criminal record; or
* genetic information.

RDC Media will not collect sensitive information unless the individual has consented to the collection of that information or the collection is required or authorised by law.

**_What if you don't provide us with your personal information?_**

The nature of the business carried on by RDC Media means that, generally, it is not possible for us to provide services to you anonymously. However, in some circumstances, we allow individuals the option of not identifying themselves, or of using a pseudonym, when dealing with us, for example, where you write to a RDC Media publication or where you post on the Website.

  
**5\. HOW INFORMATION IS HELD BY RDC MEDIA**

RDC Media has commercially reasonable processes in place to ensure the security of an individual’s personal information including encryption of all data when it is transferred to Best Bets' service providers and limitations on access to personal information within RDC Media. There are limitations on access to information within RDC Media.

Only certain RDC Media employees, being those required to have access to personal information so that RDC Media is able to carry out its functions and activities will have access to information held by RDC Media, in order to protect the information from:

Authorised RDC Media employees will require a password to access RDC Media's database, where the information is held.

If RDC Media no longer requires any information for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy, RDC Media will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to securely destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de-identified.

(a) misuse, interference and loss; and  
(b) unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

  
**6\. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal information collected in the course of Journalism Activities will be handled in accordance with the Australian Press Council's Privacy Standards which are available here: http://www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles/.

**_Direct marketing_**

RDC Media may disclose personal information (not sensitive information) to third parties for the purposes of direct marketing services related to the thoroughbred racing industry. An individual will be able to opt-out of direct marketing at any time if he or she chooses, by following the relevant opt-out or unsubscribe instructions in the relevant communication, the preference centre which can be accessed via the Website or by notifying Customer Support at support@racing.zendesk.com.

RDC Media will not use or disclose personal information about an individual for the purpose of direct marketing, unless RDC Media collected the information:

    * where the individual would reasonably expect RDC Media to use or disclose the personal information for that purpose; and
    * the individual has not opted out of receiving direct marketing, or
* from a third party:
    * where the individual has consented to disclosure for that purpose, or it is impracticable to obtain that consent;
    * the communication includes an opt out statement which makes clear to the individual the simple way to opt out of receiving direct marketing; and
    * the individual has not opted out of receiving direct marketing.

  
**7\. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CORRECTION**

A person can access his or her own personal information by contacting RDC Media's Privacy Officer. RDC Media’s Privacy Officer will respond within a reasonable period after the request is made.

In some circumstances, a fee may apply.

RDC Media will endeavour to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information it holds is accurate, up to date and complete. If the information held by RDC Media is inaccurate, incomplete or not up to date, the individual may request that RDC Media correct the information.

There are some circumstances in which RDC Media is entitled to deny a person access to information, in part or full.  These include, amongst others, circumstances where:

* RDC Media believes that giving access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health or public safety;
*  giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
* the request for access is frivolous or vexatious;  
    the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between RDC Media and the individual, and would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings;
* giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within RDC Media in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process;
* giving access would be likely to prejudice one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of an enforcement body;
* giving access would be unlawful (for example, if providing the information would amount to a breach of legal professional privilege or a breach of confidence); or
* denying access is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order.

If any request for access to information is to be denied in part or full or not provided in the manner requested by an individual, RDC Media will give the individual a written notice, setting out, amongst others, the reasons for the refusal except to the extent that, having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be unreasonable to do so.  

**8\. DATA AND SECURITY**

We hold personal information in a number of ways, including in hard copy documents, electronic databases, email contact lists, and in paper files held in drawers and cabinets. Paper files may also be archived in boxes and stored offsite in secure facilities. We take reasonable steps to:

* make sure that the personal information that we collect, use and disclose is accurate, up to date and complete and (in the case of use and disclosure) relevant;
* protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure; and
* destroy or permanently de-identify personal information that is no longer needed for any purpose that is permitted by the APPs.

You can help us keep your information up to date, by letting us know about any changes to your details, such as your address, email address or phone number.

The steps we take to secure the personal information we hold include website protection measures (such as firewalls and anti-virus software), security restrictions on access to our computer systems (such as login and password protection), controlled access to our corporate premises, policies on document storage and security, personnel security, staff training and workplace policies.

For example, if the “racing calendar” is the most popular page, we can make sure it is easily accessible from the homepage.
* _Marketing_ _or advertising cookies_: these cookies are used to deliver personalised content or advertising to you in line with your interests. For example, if you have shown an interest in race meetings at a particular racecourse, or in a particular trainer, we may deliver content relevant to that racecourse or trainer. This could be delivered to you in various forms, such as personalised home page content, welcome screens or pop ups.

RDC Media also uses a third party service, Google Analytics, which may also provide us with information about you, such as your IP address, location, gender, age bracket, language and interests based on your interaction with Google platforms.

Different browsers provide different methods to block and delete cookies used by websites. To find out more about how to manage and delete cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
