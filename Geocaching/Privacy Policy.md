ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY
-------------------------

When you use our services, we process your personal information. This privacy policy explains the ways that we process your personal information and our reasons for doing so. It is divided into sections to make it easier to read.

While we are based in the United States, we recognize that people in many different countries also use our services. Privacy laws vary depending on your location. As the majority of people who use our services are in the U.S. and Europe, we have based our privacy policy on U.S. law and the European Economic Area’s (EEA) privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). When processing personal data (also “personal information” or “information” or “data”), we act as the controller within the meaning of GDPR.

STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
------------------------------------

We will keep your data only for as long as it is necessary for the specific purpose or purposes for which we have collected or used them in accordance with this privacy policy.

### Account deletion

If you want to [permanently delete your account](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=102) or following your explicit request for deletion of any of your personal information, we will delete your account and/or help you to delete your personal information as requested. Due to the nature of the game and the way that users interact, you will need to take all steps necessary to facilitate the deletion, including adopting or removing any geocaches you own, [deleting your logs](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=547), and disabling your account. We will then complete the deletion process as soon as possible. The way our systems are structured, in some cases, it may take up to 30 days for records to be deleted or overwritten. In some circumstances (set out below) we may keep your personal information for longer.

Because of the nature of our services, which require a cellular data plan or GPS device and the ability to travel to various locations, our services are not directed toward anyone under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 16 has an account not created and managed by you, then you may alert us via [email](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=request) or otherwise [contact us](https://www.geocaching.com/contact/) and request that we delete that child’s personal information.

### When you stop playing

If you stop playing or temporarily disable your account, without taking any further steps or asking us to permanently delete your account or personal information, we will keep your information as long as needed to ensure the integrity of the game and the enjoyment of other players. Your geocache and trackable logs and any images associated with them will remain as part of the historic record of the geocache or trackable with which they are associated unless you delete them. If you have provided personal information or content that other users need to use in relation to the services (for example, information about a particular geocache you have logged or placed; if you have moved or logged a particular trackable; or if you have left instructions or goals about a particular trackable), we may retain that information for as long as we need to provide the services to our other users, but you may always delete that information if you wish. We know that sometimes users take a break from the game and come back at a later time, which is why we don’t automatically permanently delete your account and personal information if you stop playing or temporarily disable your account. We may contact you if you have stopped playing or temporarily disabled your account to check if you would like us to permanently delete your information. However, after three years of inactivity, we may delete your account without contacting you.

Please note that once your account and personal information has been deleted, we cannot get it back. If you don’t ask us to permanently delete your account and personal information, except as provided above, we will keep it until you want to reactivate your account, and we will store it securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

### Information provided for a specific purpose

If you have provided us with personal information for a specific purpose, we will keep your personal information for as long as we need to fulfill that purpose. Specifically:

* If you have provided address information as part of a competition entry, we will keep that information for as long as necessary to administer the competition, typically about a year.
* We will retain your contact details if you have an account with us or if we think you may be interested in marketing messages, offers, promotions, or new services. You will always have the choice of opting out of receiving these messages. If you do so, we will remove you from our email marketing lists as soon as we can but typically within 10 business days.
* If you have posted content online in the discussion forums, unless you request deletion, we will retain that content for as long as we think the topic is relevant. After this time, we may delete the post or archive it.

Where we have obtained personal information automatically about your use of our services (e.g., analytics), we will keep this information for as long as we feel it may be useful to us to improve and develop our business. We will delete it when it is no longer useful. This will normally be within 24 months of completion of the purpose for which it was originally collected.

In some cases, we may be required to store personal information beyond the period of time that we need it for the purposes for which we have collected it, taking into account factors including:

* legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain personal information for a certain period of time (e.g., compliance with tax and accounting requirements).
* the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (e.g., for the purposes of a potential dispute).

If a law requires us to hold onto your personal information, we will store your data for the amount of time required by that law. Further, we will store your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interest, such as the requirement to create proper documentation of our business operations.

PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
---------------------------------------

We have implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information, you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We and our payment card processors work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of transport layer security (TLS), which encrypts the information you input.

HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKERS
-------------------------------------

We also collect data about your use of our services through a variety of tracking technologies, such as cookies, pixels, and software development kits (SDKs). We use these trackers on our websites, in our email communications, and – to a more limited extent – on our mobile applications.

A cookie is a small text file that is downloaded and stored onto your computer, mobile phone, or similar device when you use our websites that enables us to: (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and settings; (c) understand the web pages of our services you have visited and the referral sites that have led you to our services; (d) enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and analytics; and (f) assist with security administrative functions. You can find more detailed information in the Cookies section of your account Settings on the website and at [https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/cookies](https://www.geocaching.com/account/documents/cookies).

Pixel trackers (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email, that are designed to provide usage information, like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of our services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. 

SDKs are pieces of software code provided by our digital vendors (e.g., analytics providers) that are embedded into our mobile apps and are intended to collect and analyze certain device and user data, such as analytics, crash data, and digital identify information to provide services like login via Facebook.

### Information we collect using trackers

  `We collect the following information from you:`

* The date and time you use our services
* Information about your browser, system, or device configuration
* Your IP address
* Your interactions with our websites and the pages you visit
* Your interactions with our mobile apps
* Analytics information
* Crash reporting

### Managing trackers

Depending on the laws in your location, you may have the ability to choose which types of cookies and pixels you wish to accept through the tools we provide on our website. You may also use the tools in your browser to disable cookies and pixels; however, disabling certain cookiesmay limit functionality of our services.

_On some user profile pages and cache pages, account holders have used links to third-party sites to display content. In some cases, these third-party links may have associated cookies and pixels. Due to the volume of such content, we may be unable to identify all of these cookies and pixles or provide the ability for you to disable them. Please consider browser-based blocking if you wish to block these types of trackers._

### Types of trackers that we use

#### Strictly necessary trackers

Strictly necessary trackers help make our websites usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the websites. The websites cannot function properly without these trackers.

#### Preference trackers

Preference trackers enable our websites to remember information that changes the way the websites behave or look, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.

#### Statistics (also called analytics) trackers

Statistics trackers help us to understand how visitors interact with our services by collecting and reporting information about interactions with our services.

#### Advertising trackers

Advertising trackers are used by third parties to track visitors across websites. The purpose is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and therefor more valuable for publishers and third-party advertisers.

### For users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland

For users in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, the legal basis for using strictly necessary cookies and pixels is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. For all other cookies and pixels, including the third-party applications listed below, we use cookies and pixels on the basis of your consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).

To the extent that we use cookies and pixels based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, which will take effect moving forward (but not retroactively). You can withdraw your consent by changing your cookie settings in your account Settings on our websites or as outlined below for specific third-party applications.

Please note that even if you withdraw your consent, some trackers might not be blocked. Content that other account holders place on our websites (e.g., on their cache pages) in some cases includes links that trigger advertising trackers from third-party sites. Because of the volume of this content, we are not able to identify all of these trackers. Please consider browser-based blocking instead.
