Donor Privacy Policy
====================

The purpose of the [Crohn's & Colitis Foundation](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/about/) website is to provide information about the Foundation and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to people living with [Crohn's disease](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/what-are-crohns-and-colitis/what-is-crohns-disease/) and [ulcerative colitis](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/what-are-crohns-and-colitis/what-is-ulcerative-colitis/), as well as to their families and friends, healthcare professionals, and the general public.

What information do we collect and how do we use it?
----------------------------------------------------

You may browse our website without identifying yourself or providing any personally identifiable information. When you interact with us through your computer, however, we do record certain non-identifying site-usage data, such as your number of visits to our website pages. 

If you elect to donate, register for an event, or sign up for any of our publications, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email address. 

We may use this information to communicate with you by email or postal mail from time to time. The Foundation keeps all names, addresses, and all other personal information supplied by participants of our website strictly confidential. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, such as on message boards, through email, or in chat areas, that information may be collected and used by others. 

Some parts of our website may also use "cookies," which are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer through your web browser. You may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. However if cookies are rejected, some pages on our website may not function properly.

**Please note: Children under the age of 13 should receive parental consent prior to disclosing any personal information.**

Do we share your information?
-----------------------------

For disclosure of demographic information (e.g., rental or exchange of donor lists with other organizations), the Foundation as a minimum will use the "opt-out" approach. An "opt-out" is obtained when the Foundation gives individuals an opportunity to decline or "opt-out" of disclosures to third parties. If an individual does not opt out, permission is deemed granted.

What security do we provide to protect your personal information?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Foundation uses multiple electronic and administrative safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access, such as firewall technologies and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security, which is described below. Access to your account information is protected via system passwords which are changed periodically. Despite use of these safeguards, we cannot guarantee and do not represent that your information will always be secure from unauthorized access.

Do we provide a secure environment for online transactions?
-----------------------------------------------------------

All credit card information collected through online transactions are processed with SSL security, an established protocol for transmitting information via the Internet which uses server authentication and data encryption to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and available only to authorized staff members of the Foundation.

How can you contact us to review or correct your personal information?
