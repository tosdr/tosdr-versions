* **You own your Content**: You are the owner of the Content you publish. You can edit and remove them on your **[profile page](https://www.scamadviser.com/account)**.

If a Website disagrees with Content you posted, they will be able to contact you via our system to discuss the content.
* **Content must be based on your experience**: Your Content must be about a real experience you have had with the Website you review. We may ask you for proof of your interaction with the website. This can be an order confirmation, invoice, delivery notes, screenshots of your user profile or email correspondence with the Website.
* **Content must be legit**: Your Content must be legit and may not violate or infringe applicable law, other people's or companies' rights, including intellectual property rights and rights of privacy.
* **Content must be relevant**: The Content must give your opinion about the Website. They may not contain political, ethical or commercial information, links to other (non-relevant or commercial) sites or otherwise contain information not related to the experience you have had with the Website.
* **Content may not be violent/discriminatory**: We accept emotional Content which may contain some foul language. We do NOT accept Content that incite violence and/or are sexist, political, racial, or otherwise contain discriminatory information.
* **Publishers should not benefit**: As a Publisher, you may not accept gifts, payment or other reimbursements for leaving Content. You may not publish Content about a Websites which you or your direct family owns or competes with. The same applies to Content about companies of which you are an employee or have a working relationship with.

We do not censor, monitor or, moderate Content on our Website, either before or after the Content is published. A Website or other users of our platform can report your Content to us for violation of the Content Guidelines we have listed above. In such a case we will evaluate the Content.

Once the Content is edited or enough proof is provided, we will unhide the Content.
