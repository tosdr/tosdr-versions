**Terms and Conditions for our Website and Mobile Application**   

===================================================================

**Purpose**  

Kaiser Permanente provides a website and a mobile app:

* "kaiserpermanente.org," or “healthy.kaiserpermanente.org,” or "kp.org" (the Website)
* “KP Mobile Application” (the App), for both iPhone and Android

The Website and the App are referred to collectively in these Terms and Conditions as the “Site."

The Site allows users to:

* view health-related information
* communicate with our practitioners and our staff
* arrange for clinical and health plan services
* access additional services
* consent to receive important communications and documents (such as notices, videos and telephony) regarding their health plan coverage electronically through the email address and/or mobile number specified by the user for this purpose

The information provided on the Site is not a substitute for the advice of a personal physician or other qualified health care professional and does not constitute a diagnosis or professional treatment recommendation. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health care professional with any questions regarding medical symptoms or a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the Site.

If you think you or someone you are taking care of has a medical or psychiatric emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital.

Agreement

BY USING THE SITE OR BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" BELOW, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITE.

Using secure messaging

Kaiser Permanente provides users with a number of interactive online services to help them better communicate with our practitioners and staff. These services may include (but are not limited to):

* secure messaging, including:
    * email the doctor's office
    * ask a pharmacist
    * appointment requests

You agree that you will not upload or transmit any communications or content of any type (including secure messaging) that infringe upon, misappropriate or violate any rights of any party.

Please note: if you register for the Website before your coverage has started, you will have access to only a limited set of functions prior to when your full coverage begins. If you’re registered for the Website, but do not have active coverage, you will have access to records of your past care and coverage, if any.

Viewing medical records

Users may use the Site to view certain information displayed from their medical records, including the results of certain laboratory tests. Using the lab test result feature is considered to be a request to receive lab test results online or on a mobile device.

Users may also authorize other users of the Site to view health information displayed through the "Act for a Family Member" feature. If you are authorized to access another user's health information, you agree to protect the confidentiality of this information and comply with state and federal privacy laws that may prohibit the redisclosure of health information without the express written authorization of the person who is the subject of the health information, including but not limited to federal law prohibiting the redisclosure of health information regarding alcohol and drug abuse referral and treatment.

In addition, although the Site displays certain information in medical records, they do not necessarily display all information found in those medical records. If you think that medical record information displayed on the Site is inaccurate, you can request Kaiser Permanente to amend the medical record by mailing a request to the department identified in your regional Notice of Privacy Practices. (A link to the Regional Notice of Privacy Practices is available at the bottom of each page on the Website) To request a complete copy of a medical record, please contact the department identified in your regional Notice of Privacy Practices responsible for providing records.

Any personal information you submit to the Site (for yourself or someone else) is governed by our Website and KP Mobile Application Privacy Statement. (A link to our Website and KP Mobile Application Privacy Statement is available at the bottom of each page on our Website and on the "Home" screen at the bottom of the KP Mobile Application.) This includes information on your rights to see and receive copies of your own or others' personal health information.

KP Mobile Application: "Jailbreaking" the mobile operating system

The KP Mobile Application is intended for use only on a mobile device that is running an unmodified manufacturer-approved operating system. Using the KP Mobile Application on a device with a modified operating system may undermine security features that are intended to protect health information from unauthorized or unintended disclosure. You may compromise your health information or the health information of anyone for whom you have been given access, if you use the KP Mobile Application on a mobile device that has been modified. Use of the KP Mobile Application on a mobile device with a modified operating system is a material breach of these Terms and Conditions.

Passwords and Biometric Authentication

Kaiser Permanente has several tools that allow you to record and store information. You are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to your Kaiser Permanente online password or account. It is your sole responsibility to (1) control the disclosure and use of your activation codes, password reset codes and password; (2) authorize, monitor, and control access to and use of your Kaiser Permanente online account and password; and (3) promptly change your password if you feel it has become compromised; and (4) promptly inform the Site manager of any need to deactivate an account entirely.

To change your password, sign on and choose the arrow icon next to your name at the top of the page. Then, select Profile and Preferences. To deactivate your account, you may contact our Site Manager using the link available at the bottom of each Website web page. If you're using a mobile device and would like to change your password or deactivate your account, please go to the Website and follow the above steps.

If you forget your Website password, among the available methods for resetting your password is the option to choose to have a one-time password reset code sent to either the email address you provided to us when you registered for the Website or via SMS/Text on your primary mobile number on file. To protect your privacy, we recommend that you not use an email address or mobile device that you share with anyone else. To update your email address, sign on to the Website and choose the arrow icon next to your name at the top of the page. Then, select Profile and Preferences and follow the instructions provided. To update your mobile number, sign on to KP Mobile Application and tap Profile icon on top right corner and follow instructions provided.

If you enable biometric authentication (e.g., iOS or iPadOS Face ID, Touch ID or Android Fingerprint) to sign on to the App, it is your responsibility to be aware that all faces or fingerprints set up on your device for such biometric authentication will be linked to your Website account associated with the App. If other people use the biometric authentication method enabled on your device, they may be able to gain access to your Kaiser account via the App and view information you consider to be private. It is your responsibility to understand the risks of biometric authentication enabled on your mobile device.

You can stop using biometric authentication to sign on to the App at any time. You can elect this option by going to the settings in the App and turning off Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint.

Breaches of these Terms and Conditions

In consideration of being allowed to use the Site interactive services, you agree that the following actions shall constitute a material breach of these Terms and Conditions:

* signing on as or pretending to be another person (Note: this does not restrict authorized use of the "Act for a Family Member" feature on the Site.)
* using secure messaging for any purpose in violation of local, state, national, international laws or posted Kaiser Permanente policies
* transmitting material that infringes or violates the intellectual property rights of others or the privacy or publicity rights of others
* transmitting material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, predatory of minors, threatening, harassing, abusive, slanderous, or hateful to any person (including Kaiser Permanente personnel) or entity as determined by Kaiser Permanente in its sole discretion
* using interactive services in a way that is intended to harm, or a reasonable person would understand would likely result in harm, to the user or others
* collecting information about others, including email addresses
* intentionally distributing viruses or other harmful computer code
* attempting to (1) probe, scan, "hack", or test the vulnerability of the Site or any Kaiser Permanente system or network; or (2) breach any security or authentication measures on the Site or any Kaiser Permanente system connected to either the Site
* using any "deep-link", "page-scrape", "robot", "spider", data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automatic device, program, algorithm or methodology, to (1) access, acquire, copy or monitor any portion of the Site, or (2) in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Site
* "Jailbreaking" the operating system of a mobile device using the App

Kaiser Permanente expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate a user's access to any interactive services and/or to any or all other areas of the Site due to any act that would constitute a violation of these Terms and Conditions. To the extent there is an inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions and the Website and KP Mobile Application Privacy Statement, these Terms and Conditions shall govern.

Kaiser Permanente may offer interactive areas of the Site under license with Third Party software service providers. These Terms and Conditions extend to and apply to your use of our licensors’ software. Our licensors are direct third-party beneficiaries of applicable rights under these Terms and Conditions. By using our licensor’s software, you agree to be bound directly to our licensors with respect to your compliance with these Terms and Conditions. Kaiser Permanente may directly enforce the licensors’ rights under these Terms and Conditions on the licensors’ behalf or a licensor may enforce its rights under these Terms and Conditions directly against you or other users who breach these Terms and Conditions.

Health Care Delivery Communications by email

By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you agree to receive care delivery essential communications by email. These communications may include (but are not limited to):

* notification that an important message awaits you on the Site (this may be a message from a doctor, a new lab test result, an appointment confirmation, a response from a pharmacist, etc.)
* Site and/or service updates 
* emergency alerts and critical messages (for example, if a snowstorm or wildfire has temporarily closed a medical center)
* general health communications from Kaiser Permanente providers

While you have Kaiser Permanente coverage, you may receive the monthly _Partners in Health_ wellness update by email as part of your essential communications and services. In addition, you may periodically receive online invitations to participate in member satisfaction and other types of surveys related to your experiences at Kaiser Permanente. Your participation in such surveys is always optional.

You should take appropriate precautions to protect personal and confidential information, and to use your devices/apps in a secure and responsible manner. We are not responsible for the security of your devices and we expect that you will configure them in a secure and responsible manner.

We will use a secure transmission method to send you communications that include protected health information (as that term is defined under HIPAA) through e-mail, our Website, and/or Mobile App. While such secure transmission methods provide reasonable protections against unauthorized access, no system can perfectly guard against risks of intentional intrusion or inadvertent disclosure of information sent to us. Moreover, when you transmit information via the internet, your information will be transmitted over a medium that is beyond our control, and therefore the security of the transmission may be compromised before it reaches us. Accordingly, we make no guarantee as to confidentiality or security. If you have concerns regarding the electronic transmission of protected health information, you should consider using non-electronic communication methods to receive documents relating to health plan coverage.

All Kaiser Permanente staff and vendors who have access to, or are involved with, the processing of personal information are trained to respect the confidentiality of your personal information.

Communications by Phone or Text  

You verify that any phone information provided to KP is true and accurate, and that you are the current subscriber or owner of any telephone number that you provide.

You acknowledge that automated calls or text messages may be made to your telephone number(s) even if your telephone number(s) is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list.

You acknowledge that neither Kaiser Permanente nor Carriers are liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

As always, message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to you from us and to us from you. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your wireless provider.

**NOTE:** Not all health plan coverage documents and/or communications may be available in your region, for your plan, and/or via the Mobile App. As additional health plan coverage communications and documents are added to those already available electronically, Kaiser Permanente will notify you. You may be asked to consent again to the receipt of documents electronically.

Electronic Delivery of Health Plan Coverage Communications

You have the option to choose which health plan coverage communications and/or documents you receive electronically. You may always change your mind and receive any of your health plan coverage communications or documents in paper copy. To get a copy of a specific health care delivery or health plan coverage communication in paper, log on to your KP.org account and navigate to “My Documents”, click on the specific document you’d like to view and simply save and print the document.

A. Electronic Delivery Method

If you consent to the receipt of communications and documents relating to health plan coverage by electronic delivery, they will be made available electronically through the Website. \[and/or Mobile App\] All communications that we provide to you in electronic form, will be provided either (1) via email; (2) via the Website as described in an email notice we send to you at the time the information is available; (3) to the extent permissible by law, by access to a Third-Party Website as described in advance for such purpose in an email notice we send to you at the time the information is available; or (4) by an email requesting that you access or download a PDF file from the Website containing the document. 

Note: You will have the opportunity to print or save this information about electronic delivery and keep it for your records. By consenting to electronic delivery, you also agree to print out or download all documents we provide to you electronically and keep copies for your records

B. Notification that you have a New Communication  

When a new document or communication is delivered electronically through the Website, you will be notified by email to the primary email address found in your Website profile. If Kaiser Permanente receives a notification of delivery failure (i.e. a “bounce message”) that indicates that the primary email address which we have on file for you is no longer valid, we will suspend electronic delivery of all documents and communications and either notify you again using another method (such as text) or return to paper delivery of your documents and communications. We will then mail your communications and/or documents to the last known mailing address on file.

C. Hardware and Software Requirements  

In order to access and retain your electronic documents, you will need the following computer hardware and software:

* A computer with an internet connection
* A current web browser that includes 128-bit encryption (e.g., Microsoft Edge , Firefox version 71 or later, Chrome version 49 or later, or Safari version 11 or later) with cookies enabled
* Current Adobe Acrobat Reader version to open documents in PDF format
* A valid email address (your primary email address in your Website profile) 
* Sufficient storage space to save past documents or an installed printer to print them  
    

**By giving your consent at this time, you agree that you have access to the necessary hardware and software as listed above, and are able to receive, open, and print or download a copy of any document for your records.**  

We will notify you if there are any material changes to the hardware or software needed to receive electronic documents from Kaiser Permanente at least 30 days in advance of the date any such changes are made. At that time, we will also provide instructions on how to withdraw, change, or renew your consent for electronic delivery of your documents.

D. Updating your Contact Information  

**It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that Kaiser Permanente can communicate with you electronically.  
  
**You understand and agree that if Kaiser Permanente sends you an email notification that a communication and/or document was sent and/or an electronic document has been posted, and we do not receive a notification of delivery failure (i.e. a “bounce message”), Kaiser Permanente will be deemed to have provided the communication to and/or document you. This could occur if, for example, you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications.  

Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add the Kaiser Permanente email address to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the communications we send to you (please consult the instructions of your spam filter for specific directions on how to do this).  
  
You can update your primary email address or mailing address at any time through your Website profile. To change your primary email address and/or mailing address, navigate to the Personal Info section of the Profiles and Preferences page on KP.org website. To update contact information on the KP Mobile Application, click on the profiles and settings icon in the upper right-hand corner and select “Contact Information” from the drop-down menu and follow the instructions.

E. How to Withdraw your Consent  

Your consent will remain in effect until your Kaiser Permanente health plan coverage is terminated or you explicitly withdraw your consent by changing your delivery preferences through your Website profile. You may contact the Kaiser Permanente Member Services Call Center by phone and ask a customer service representative to assist you.  
  
**When your Kaiser Permanente health plan coverage is terminated, your document(s) will be sent to you by U.S. mail at your last known mailing address on file.**

F. Requesting paper copies of electronic communications and documents  

If, after you consent to receive your documents electronically, you would like to receive a paper copy of a document we previously sent you, you may request a paper copy within one year of the date we provided the document to you by contacting the Kaiser Permanente Member Services Call Center.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials appearing on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.

In addition, if you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. One place to find more information is the U.S. Copyright Office website, currently located at [https://www.copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/ "https://www.copyright.gov, Opens in a new window, external")﻿.

In accordance with the DMCA, Kaiser Permanente has designated an agent to receive notification of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the DMCA.
