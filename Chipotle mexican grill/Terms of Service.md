###### VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS AND REMEDIES

You agree that Chipotle may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, block and/or terminate your access to the Services if Chipotle determines that you have violated these Terms or other agreements or guidelines that may be associated therewith. You also agree that any violation, or threatened violation, by you of these Terms constitutes an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable and unquantifiable harm to Chipotle. You also agree that monetary damages would be inadequate for such harm and consent to Chipotle’s obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Chipotle deems necessary or appropriate. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies that Chipotle may have at law or in equity.

If Chipotle takes legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms, Chipotle will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Chipotle. You agree that Chipotle will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Services, mobile app, programs, and/or services as a result of any violation of these Terms.

###### GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

These Terms are governed by United States law and are subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of these Terms, or the rights and obligations of you or Chipotle in connection with your use of the Services or your Submitted Content, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Colorado, without giving effect to the conflict of laws rules thereof.

###### DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

You agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise relating in any way to or arising out of these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution section. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.

You agree that whenever you have a disagreement with Chipotle arising out of, connected to, or in any way related to these Terms, you will send a written notice to Chipotle (“Demand”). You agree that the requirements of this Dispute Resolution section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms. You must send the Demand to the following address (the “Notice Address”): Legal Department, Chipotle Mexican Grill c/o CMG Strategy Co., LLC, 610 Newport Center Dr., Suite 1300, Newport Beach, CA 92660. You agree that you will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until 20 business days after you send a Demand. If the disagreement stated in the Demand is not resolved to your satisfaction within 10 business days after it is received, and you intend on taking legal action, you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “Arbitrator”). This arbitration provision limits the ability of you and Chipotle to litigate claims in court and you and Chipotle each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial or a state or federal judge. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would. You agree that you will not file any lawsuit against Chipotle in any state or federal court. You agree that if you do sue in state or federal court, and Chipotle brings a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay all fees and costs incurred by Chipotle in court, including reasonable attorney’s fees. For any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must effect proper service under the rules of the Arbitrator and notice to the Notice Address may not be sufficient. If, for any reason, the American Arbitration Association is unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedure effective September 15, 2005 (as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute Resolution section. You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute you have with Chipotle. The Federal Arbitration Act allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate.

You agree that you will not file a class action or collective action against Chipotle, and that you will not participate in a class action or collective action against them. You agree that you will not join your claims to those of any other person. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms, if this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to arbitrate is null and void, as though it were never entered into, and any arbitration dispute at that time will be dismissed without prejudice and may be refiled in a court. Under no circumstances do you or Chipotle agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration. Chipotle agrees that we will submit all disputes with you to arbitration before the Arbitrator.

###### MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Chipotle and govern your use of the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Chipotle with respect to the Services. Both you and Chipotle acknowledge and agree that no partnership is formed and neither you nor Chipotle has the power or the authority to obligate or bind the other.

The failure of Chipotle to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ original intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.

The failure of Chipotle to comply with these Terms because of an act of God, war, fire, riot, terrorism, earthquake, actions of federal, state, or local governmental authorities, or for any other reason beyond the reasonable control of Chipotle shall not be deemed a breach of this agreement. If Chipotle fails to act with respect to your breach or anyone else’s breach on any occasion, Chipotle is not waiving its right to act with respect to future or similar breaches.

The headings in these Terms are for your convenience and reference. These headings do not limit or affect this agreement.

If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

###### BINDING AGREEMENT

These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Chipotle, and are accepted by you upon your use of the Services. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Chipotle regarding the use of the Services and the features therein and supersedes and replaces any prior agreements between you and Chipotle regarding the use of the Services. By using the Services, you represent that you are capable of entering into a binding agreement, and that you agree to be bound by these Terms.
