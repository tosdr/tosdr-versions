Privacy Policy
==============

English

español / SPANISH

français / FRENCH

Last updated June 17, 2024 – Version 4.8

This privacy policy describes the collection, use, protection, disclosure, correction, and deletion of your personal information by Subsplash.  Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information.  Your privacy is a priority at Subsplash, and we go to great lengths to protect it.

This privacy policy applies to the websites located at subsplash.com and thechurchapp.com, including all subpages and successor pages, as well as all software and services that we offer, including but not limited to those services that we offer through our websites when you register for a Subsplash account (collectively referred to as the “Subsplash Account Services”).

Subsplash may update its privacy policy from time to time.  When we change the policy in a material way a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy.

### WHY WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

We collect your personal information because:

* It helps Subsplash deliver and administrate your Subsplash Account Services;
* It helps Subsplash deliver a superior level of customer service;
* It enables Subsplash to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you;
* It helps Subsplash keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about. If you do not want Subsplash to keep you up to date with Subsplash news, software updates and the latest information on products and services please submit your request [here](https://www.subsplash.com/legal/data-request) or send an email request to privacy@subsplash.com.

### WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT, WHEN WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW WE MAY USE IT

If you wish to utilize Subsplash Account Services, Subsplash needs your information for purposes of processing and transmitting information to drive the correct data and content between servers and apps for your experience.

Also, there are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better service.  For example:

* We may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading a software update, registering for a seminar, participating in an online survey, registering your products, or purchasing a product;
* When you interact with Subsplash, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about the Subsplash products you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase; and information relating to a support or service issue;
* We collect information regarding customer activities on our websites and applications.  This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites, products, and Internet services are of most interest to them, and diagnose problems with our servers and websites;
* When you visit the Subsplash mobile application, we may ask you to opt in to allow us to use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location for purposes of reporting on user activity and engagement.  If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, you should not opt in or turn off the location services for the Subsplash mobile application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile application;
* We may use personal information to provide products and/or services that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve Subsplash’s products; and
* If you utilize the Subsplash messaging functionality, Subsplash stores the contents of your messages which may contain personal information, may obtain your mobile device’s number or your email, and may request access to your mobile device’s contacts for the purpose of accessing and storing only the phone number and/or the email address of the particular persons that you opt to contact through the Service—Subsplash will not copy any contact information regarding persons that you do not contact through the Service.  With regard to the contact information of the particular persons that you opt to contact through the Service, Subsplash will only utilize that information for purposes of providing the Service, and will not use that information for any other purpose;
* If you sign up for Subsplash Messaging, as described above, and you choose to invite other users to join a conversation, Subsplash will request access to your contacts, though it is not required in order to invite other users to your conversation. Subsplash will only use this access to enable you to invite other users.
* Subsplash may use aggregated and anonymized forms of personal information for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, analyzing usage trends, fraud detection, and development of new Services.

### PUBLICLY DISPLAYED INFORMATION IS PUBLIC

If you use a bulletin board, streaming service, messaging service, or chat room on a Subsplash website or Service you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users.  Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages.  Subsplash is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by disclosing it in such forms or by enabling certain user features, Subsplash will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.

### WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION

Subsplash takes your privacy very seriously.  Subsplash does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers or any other third party.  If you wish to utilize the Subsplash Account Services, Subsplash discloses your information to third-party service providers and institutions for purposes of processing and transmitting information to drive the correct data and content between servers and apps for your experience. If you invite other users to one of our services, we may inform the person(s) you invite of who has invited them. Subsplash may share aggregated and anonymized forms of personal information with third parties, in which case, the information shared will be shared in a deidentified and non-identifiable form.

### WITHIN THE SUBSPLASH GROUP

Subsplash, Inc. and Subsplash Wallet, LLC both operate under the name “Subsplash” and they operate as a group.  To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Subsplash group globally who will take reasonable steps to safeguard it in accordance with Subsplash’s privacy policy.

### WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, VENDORS, AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS

There are also times when it may be advantageous for Subsplash to make certain personal information about you available to companies that Subsplash has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Subsplash to provide products and services to you on our behalf.  These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys.  These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in strict accordance with Subsplash’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the Subsplash website.

### PARTNER PROMOTIONS

We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third party partners. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by and/or associated with a third party partner, then the information that you provide will be shared with us and with them. Their use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy.

‍

### BUSINESS TRANSFERS

We may choose to buy or sell assets and may share and/or transfer customer information, including Personal Information, in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions and based on our legitimate interests. Also, if we or our assets are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information may be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.

### ‍

### LAWFUL REQUESTS

At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information.  We may also disclose information about you if we reasonably determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

### SUBSPLASH GIVING

Subsplash Giving is web-enabled functionality that can be used with a web browser and on mobile devices.  It was developed by Subsplash to enable donors to donate money to third-party organizations. If you choose to use the Subsplash Giving functionality to donate money, Subsplash and the payment processor will collect personal information from you, including your name, contact information, the donation amounts, and the payment processor receives certain payment information (e.g. credit card number, billing address, security code) and will use that information to process payments and provide you records of the transactions. Donor information will be shared with the Gift Recipient.

When you send a text message to Subsplash or Subsplash Wallet for purposes of utilizing text-to-give functionality, you will be disclosing your cell phone number to Subsplash, Inc., and you thereby consent to receiving a hyperlink to the Subsplash Wallet donation portal via text message. In order to stop receiving texts from Subsplash or Subsplash Wallet, respond to the text message by typing, “STOP.”

### SUBSPLASH LIVE

Subsplash Live utilizes Google (YouTube) API Services, in accordance with the guidelines specified in the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) and the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes). Our apps use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use Requirements.

This access is crucial for obtaining your organization's YouTube channel name and ID, as well as for initiating live streams and broadcasts on behalf of your organization. The objective is to display the connected channel in your Subsplash Dashboard and to create syndicated live broadcasts within that channel. If you decide to revoke Subsplash Live's access to your YouTube data, you can manage this through the Google security settings page at [https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions). For any questions or concerns regarding Subsplash Live's privacy practices, please contact Subsplash.

### COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Subsplash’s websites use “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there.  We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. These cookies are used to store information, such as the time that the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page.

If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, you can disable them in your browser.  Please note that certain features of the Subsplash websites and Subsplash online products will not be available once cookies are disabled.  As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We may also track usage data, such as how frequently you visit our site or use our applications, how many messages you send, and how you engage with our content.

We also use Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website.  

Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our site.

We also may use other Google Analytics tools, such as Demographics and Interest Reporting, which enable us to learn more about the characteristics and interests of the users who visit our Site, and Remarketing with Google Analytics, which enables us to provide relevant advertising on different websites and online services.

Google Analytics collects information anonymously.  It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.  You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across websites you use, visit this [Google page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We use this information, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Subsplash website.  When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page.  We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.  If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email. In addition, we use pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.

Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read.  And they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer.

### HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Subsplash takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  The Subsplash websites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the Subsplash online store, or through your Subsplash accounts, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Google, or Internet Explorer.  Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Safari or Google.

### INTEGRITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Subsplash allows you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.  Naturally, you have the right to access, correct and delete the personal information you have provided, though you may not delete all information if you wish to maintain an account with Subsplash and Subsplash is required to retain some information with regard to Subsplash Giving transactions and donors.  Despite our best efforts, errors sometimes do occur. If you identify any personal information that is out-of-date, incorrect or incomplete, let us know and we will make the corrections promptly and use every reasonable effort to communicate these changes to other parties who may have inadvertently received incorrect or out-of-date personal information from us.  In the event that you delete your information, such deletion may make it impossible for Subsplash to continue offering you some or all of the Subsplash Account Services.

Subsplash retains personal information only as long as we are required to for our business relationship or as required by Federal or Provincial laws, subject to reasonable industry practices for records retention.  Subsplash has appropriate procedures in place with respect to the destruction, deletion and disposition of personal information when it is no longer required by Subsplash, subject to applicable law.

### CHILDREN

Subsplash recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Subsplash purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy.  If a child under the age of 13 submits personal information to Subsplash without the consent of their parent or guardian and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information as soon as possible.

We will never share, sell, rent, or transfer children’s personal information other than as described in this section.

We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users which may include aggregated information that does not identify a particular person. In addition, we may disclose children’s personal information:

* To third parties that the child’s parent or guardian approved through the Services.
* If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request;
* If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Subsplash, our customers or others, including to: (1) protect the safety of a child; (2) protect the safety and security of the Services; or (3) enable us to take precautions against liability; or
* To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.

At any time, you may review your child’s personal information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the personal information, and/or refuse to permit us from further collection or using the child’s information.

You can review, change or delete your child’s personal information by:

* Logging on to your account; or
* Submitting a request [here](https://subsplash.com/legal/data-request), or by sending us an email at privacy@subsplash.com.

To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.

### CANADA CUSTOMERS

Our policies and practices have been designed to comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada), the Privacy Act (Canada) and all provincial statutes that regulate the treatment of personal information in the private and public sectors.

Depending on the location of users of the Subsplash Account Services, information on the Subsplash Account Services including the Subsplash website may be accessed from outside of Canada or sent to others outside of Canada.  Please note that any personal information that is sent outside of Canada may be subject to access by law enforcement and government authorities having jurisdiction in those countries in which the information is located.

If the event that any dispute between you and Subsplash regarding your personal information or this policy is not resolved pursuant to the “Dispute Resolution” section below within thirty (30) days, either party may consult the Privacy Commissioner of Canada or a relevant provincial privacy commissioner.

### PRIVACY NOTICE FOR EU RESIDENTS

This Section \[•\] governs personal data, information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, gathered from data subjects located in the EU only.  

General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) Information

The following information describes our commitments to you under EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).

The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "Data Controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "Data Processors"). Subsplash only acts as a Data Controller for very limited types of data, such as the information you enter when you register an account with us or the information you submit when purchasing our software.  Subsplash is the Data Controller for information provided by our users when we provide our Services. Subsplash is the Data Processor for information provided by our third party partners when they provide us with services, such as our payment partners processing payments on behalf of our users.

**When We Act as a Data Controller**

When we process your data as a Data Controller, the following applies.  

We collect, use, and share your personal data where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this. This may be because:  

* Consent:  Our use of your personal data is in accordance with your consent. If we process your personal data based on consent, you will be asked for said consent at or before the time of data collection. You may withdraw your consent at any time, and will not suffer any detriment for withdrawing your consent.
* Contract: Our use of your personal data is to fulfill a contract between you and us.
* Legal Obligation: Our use of your personal data is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have (for example, where we are required to disclose personal data to a court, or store information due to federal financial regulations); or
* Legitimate Interest: Our use of your personal data is for a legitimate interest of ours, such as fraud prevention and ensuring our network’s security.

Subject to certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking, EU residents have certain rights in relation to their personal data:  

* Right to Access: You have the right to access your personal data that is being processed; specifically you may request to view your personal data and obtain copies of your personal data.
* Right to Rectification: You have the right to request modifications to your personal data if it is out of date or inaccurate. In some circumstances, you may be able to exercise this right, in whole or in part, through your existing account with us.
* Right of Erasure: You have the right to ask that we delete your personal data.  However, we are not required to comply with your request to erase personal data if the processing of your personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
* Right to Restriction of Processing: Under certain circumstances, you have the right to request we restrict processing your personal data You have the right to restrict the use of your personal data.  However, we can continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction (a) where we have your consent; (b) to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (c) to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
* Right to Data Portability: To the extent that we process your information (i) based on your consent or under a contract; and (ii) through automated means, you have the right to receive such personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller.
* Right to Object: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data. However, we may still process your personal data if we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
* Right to Object to Automated Processing:  You have the right to object to decisions based on automated processing, such as where a computer assesses factors in the data we collect about you and makes a determination. We do not currently make any decisions based on automated processing.  

We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide you with our services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.

We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues regarding your data protection or requests with us first before contacting the relevant supervisory authority.  If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please send a request to privacy@subsplash.com. In your message, please indicate the right you would like to exercise and the information that you would like to access, review, correct, or delete.

We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the requested personal data.

We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.

**When Subsplash Acts as a Data Processor**

Where we process your data in our capacity as a Data Processor, the processing of your data will not be governed by the foregoing provisions (“When We Act As Data Controller”), but you can contact the Data Controller directly to learn about their processing of your information and to exercise your rights, or we will forward your request directly to them at your request.

Subsplash’s “privacy by design” approach requires that our default user data protection levels be at the highest setting by default. In the unlikely event of breach, Subsplash will notify data subjects and Supervisory Authorities (SAs) in the EU according to procedures provided in GDPR Articles 33 and 34.

Subsplash has certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-US DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal information received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in the privacy policy and the EU-US DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-US DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). Individuals from whom Subsplash collects personal information under the Data Privacy Framework have the right to access their personal data by contacting Subsplash [here](https://www.subsplash.com/legal/data-request) or at privacy@subsplash.com.

Subsplash’s compliance with the DPF Principles is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

**Notice and Choice**

When Subsplash collects personal information from individuals, it may share this information with its client organizations or third parties as described above in the Privacy Policy. Individuals should review the privacy policy of the client organization. Individuals will have the choice of signing up for Subsplash services or not.  A link to the Subsplash privacy policy will be provided when individuals are first asked to provide personal information when opting in to Subsplash services.

In instances in which Subsplash is not the controller or collector of the personal information, but only a processor, it has no means of providing individuals with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information or providing notices when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to Subsplash. In such instances, Subsplash will comply with the instructions of the controller of such information; provide appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and to the extent appropriate, assist the controller in responding to individuals exercising their rights under the Principles.

In the context of an onward transfer Subsplash has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the EU-US and the UK Extension to the EU-US, and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Subsplash shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**Disclosures to Third Parties**

Subsplash will not make disclosures of personal information to third parties without notifying individuals that such disclosure may be made.  In those instances in which Subsplash collects personal information from individuals, prior to disclosing personal information to a third party, Subsplash shall notify the individual of the fact that their information may be disclosed. If individuals do not wish to have their personal information disclosed to any third parties, the individual should not register for such Subsplash services.  With regard to Subsplash Giving, donor information will be shared with the Gift Recipient. The Gift Recipient may utilize a third party for purposes of receipt and management of such information and donors should review the privacy policies of Gift Recipient in this regard. In the case of third parties (e.g., churches) for whom Subsplash gathers personal information, Subsplash shall enter into a contract that provides that such data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with consent provided and that such third party will provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles.  For third party agent recipients (e.g., payment processors) of personal information, Subsplash shall: transfer only such data for limited and specified purposes; ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles, and; upon notice, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.

**Data Security**

Subsplash shall take reasonable steps to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Subsplash has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Subsplash cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via the Internet.

**Data Integrity**

Subsplash shall only process personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by those who provided the information. To the extent necessary for those purposes, Subsplash shall take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

**Access**

In those instances in which Subsplash collects personal information directly from individuals, Subsplash shall allow those individuals access to their personal information and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.  As noted above, you may not delete all information if you wish to maintain an account with Subsplash and Subsplash is required to retain some information with regard to Subsplash Giving transactions and the applicable users.

**Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability**

A)  Dispute Resolution

If you filed a complaint with Subsplash and it has not been properly addressed, JAMS is designated by Subsplash as the independent dispute resolution body to address complaints regarding Subsplash’s collection of personal information and provide appropriate recourse.  Such body will not charge the complaining party for its services. Follow this [link](https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim) to the complaint submission form for the above referenced independent dispute resolution body.

B)  Binding Arbitration

If your claims as to data covered by the EU-US and the UK Extension to the EU-US, and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework have not been remedied through dispute resolution directly with Subsplash or through independent dispute resolution as described above, such “residual claims” may be heard by a “Data Privacy Framework Panel” composed of one or three arbitrators as agreed upon by the parties.  The Panel may only award individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief (e.g. access, correction, deletion of the individual’s data in question) necessary to remedy the violation of the Principles only with respect to the individual.  Damages, costs, fees and other remedies may not be awarded, and each party bears its own attorney’s fees.  This arbitration option is only available for an individual to determine for such “residual claims” whether Subsplash has violated its obligations under the Principles as to that individual and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied.

C)  GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC and becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018. The following statement is intended to supplement the preceding discussion of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. As to personal data collected and controlled by Subsplash, subject to the qualifications and limitations stated in the preceding discussion, EU data subjects retain their full rights to be informed of the purposes of our processing activities at collection; to withdraw consent; to access, rectify, transport, and erase their personal data; to object to processing for direct marketing efforts; and to object when subjected to automated processing decisions. As to personal data collected by third parties, and as to which Subsplash is a mere processor, EU data subjects should contact the controller (e.g., church or ministry) with regard to their rights to be informed of the purposes of our processing activities at collection; to withdraw consent; to access, rectify, transport, and erase their personal data; to object to processing for direct marketing efforts; and to object when subjected to automated processing decisions.  Such rights may be subject to certain qualifications and limitations as stated in the discussion of EU-US and the UK Extension to the EU-US, and Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework.

Our Data Protection Officers will assist EU residents with these requests free of charge and may be contacted at privacy@subsplash.com.

Subsplash understands that the adoption of global data security practices is not a one-time activity.  Subsplash’s “privacy by design” approach requires that our default user data protection levels be at the highest setting by default. In the unlikely event of breach, Subsplash will notify data subjects and Supervisory Authorities (SAs) in the EU according to procedures provided in GDPR Articles 33 and 34.

We do not intentionally collect personal data from, and do not tailor any services to, children.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable California Data Subject request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable California Data Subject request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

We aspire to respond to a verifiable California Data Subject request within forty five (45) days of receipt of the request.  If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days) we will inform you of the reason(s) why an extension is needed and how long we anticipate the period to be.  Any disclosure we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding the receipt of your request.  If applicable, the response may provide the reasons why we cannot comply with your request.  For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable California Data Subject request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.  We reserve the right to refuse to respond to verifiable California Data Subject requests that are excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.

### Cookies y otras tecnologías

Al igual que la práctica estándar de muchos sitios web corporativos, los sitios web de Subsplash utilizan "cookies" y otras tecnologías para ayudarnos a comprender qué partes de nuestros sitios web son las más populares, a dónde se dirigen nuestros visitantes y cuánto tiempo pasan allí. También usamos cookies y otras tecnologías para asegurarnos de que nuestra publicidad en línea atrae a los clientes a nuestros productos y servicios. Las cookies contienen información que se transfiere al disco duro de su ordenador. Estas cookies se usan para almacenar información, como el momento en que se produjo la visita actual, si el visitante ha estado en el sitio antes y qué sitio refirió al visitante a la página web. 

Sin embargo, si prefiere no activar las cookies, puede desactivarlos en su navegador. Fíjese que ciertas características de los sitios web de Subsplash y los productos en línea de Subsplash no estarán disponibles una vez que se desactiven las cookies. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. Esta información incluye direcciones de Protocolo de Internet (IP), el tipo de navegador, el Proveedor de Servicios de Internet (ISP), páginas que lo han referido a esta/páginas de salida, sistema operativo, marca de fecha/hora y datos de flujo de clics. También podemos realizar un seguimiento de los datos de uso, tal como la frecuencia con la que usted visita nuestro sitio o usa nuestras aplicaciones, cuántos mensajes envía y cómo interactúa con nuestro contenido. 

También usamos Google Analytics. Google Analytics es una herramienta de análisis de la web que ayuda a los propietarios de sitios web a comprender cómo los visitantes interactúan con su sitio web. 

Como en muchos servicios, Google Analytics utiliza cookies propias para seguir las interacciones de los visitantes, como en nuestro caso, donde se utilizan para obtener información sobre cómo los visitantes usan nuestro sitio. Entonces, usamos la información para reunir informes y ayudarnos a mejorar nuestro sitio. 

También podemos utilizar otras herramientas de Google Analytics, tales como Demographics and Interest Reporting (informes sobre datos demográficos y de intereses), que nos permiten saber más sobre las características e intereses de los usuarios que visitan nuestro Sitio y el Remarketing (nueva comercialización) con Google Analytics, que nos permite proporcionar publicidad relevante en diferentes sitios web y servicios en línea. 

Google Analytics recopila información de modo anónimo. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Usted tiene la opción de no participar (opt out) en Google Analytics sin que eso afecte cómo visita nuestro sitio: para obtener más información sobre cómo optar para que Google Analytics no lo siga por todos los sitios web que utiliza, visite esta [página de Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Usamos esta información para analizar tendencias, para administrar el sitio, para seguir los movimientos de los usuarios por el sitio y para recopilar información demográfica sobre nuestra base de usuarios en total. 

En algunos de nuestros mensajes de correo electrónico usamos un "URL de paso" (click-through URL) vinculado al contenido del sitio web de Subsplash. Cuando los clientes hacen clic en uno de estos URLs, pasan por nuestro servidor web antes de llegar a la página web de su destino. Monitorizamos esos datos de enlace de paso para ayudarnos a determinar el interés en temas en particular y medir la efectividad de nuestras comunicaciones con los clientes. Si prefiere que no lo hagamos, simplemente evite hacer clic en los enlaces de texto o gráficos del mensaje electrónico. Además, utilizamos píxels transparentes (pequeñas imágenes gráficas) para que nos indiquen las partes de nuestro sitio web que han visitado los clientes o para medir la efectividad de las búsquedas que llevan a cabo los clientes en nuestro sitio. 

Los pixeles transparentes también nos permiten enviar mensajes de correo electrónico en un formato que los clientes puedan leer y nos dicen si se han abierto los correos electrónicos para estar seguros de que solo estamos enviando mensajes que son de interés para nuestros clientes. Podemos usar esta información para disminuir o eliminar la cantidad de mensajes que se le envían a los clientes.

### CÓMO PROTEGEMOS SU INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL

Subsplash toma precauciones, entre las que se incluyen medidas administrativas, técnicas y físicas, para proteger su información personal contra pérdida, robo y uso indebido, así como el acceso, divulgación, alteración y destrucción no autorizados. Los sitios web de Subsplash usan la codificación con Capas de Protección Segura (SSL) en todas las páginas web donde se requiere información personal. Para hacer compras en la tienda en línea de Subsplash o a través de sus cuentas de Subsplash, debe usar un navegador habilitado para SSL como Safari, Google o Internet Explorer. Hacerlo protege la confidencialidad de su información personal y la de su tarjeta de crédito mientras se transmiten por Internet. También nos puede ayudar tomando precauciones para proteger sus datos personales cuando está en Internet. Cambie sus contraseñas con frecuencia usando una combinación de letras y números y asegúrese de usar un navegador web seguro como Safari o Google.  

### LA INTEGRIDAD DE SU INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL

Subsplash le permite mantener su información personal correcta, completa y actualizada. Como es natural, usted tiene el derecho a acceder, corregir y borrar la información personal que ha proporcionado, aunque no puede borrar toda la información si desea mantener una cuenta con Subsplash. Se le exige a Subsplash que retenga cierta información en lo que se refiere a las transacciones y donantes de Subsplash Giving. A pesar de nuestros mejores esfuerzos, algunas veces ocurren errores. Si identifica cualquier información personal que no esté actualizada, esté incorrecta o incompleta, háganoslo saber y la rectificaremos sin demora. Haremos todo esfuerzo razonable para dar a conocer estos cambios a otras partes que, sin advertirlo, puedan haber recibido información personal incorrecta o no actualizada de nuestra parte. En el caso de que usted borre su información, haberlo hecho puede hacer imposible que Subsplash continúe ofreciéndole algunos o todos los Servicios de la cuenta de Subsplash. Subsplash retiene información personal solo mientras se exije que lo hagamos para nuestra relación comercial o según lo exijan las leyes federales o provinciales, sujeto a prácticas razonables de la industria para la retención de registros. Subsplash cuenta con procedimientos adecuados en lo que se refiere a destruir, borrar y disponer de información personal cuando Subsplash no la necesite más, sujeta a las leyes correspondientes. 

### MENORES DE EDAD

Subsplash reconoce que los padres, tutores u otros adultos a menudo compran nuestros productos para uso de la familia que incluye el uso por menores. No recopilamos información personal de niños menores de 13 años a sabiendas con fines de marketing, pero debido a que cierta información se recopila electrónicamente, puede parecer que es la información personal del comprador del producto de Subsplash y será tratada como tal por esta política de privacidad. Si un niño menor de 13 años envía información personal a Subsplash sin el consentimiento de sus padres o tutores y nos enteramos de que esa información personal es la información de un niño menor de 13 años, borraremos la información lo antes posible. 

Nunca compartiremos, venderemos, alquilaremos ni transferiremos información personal de menores que no sea como se describe en esta sección. 

Podemos divulgar información agregada sobre muchos de nuestros usuarios la que puede incluir información agregada que no identifica a una persona en particular, además, es posible que divulguemos información personal de los menores:

* A terceros que el padre o tutor del niño aprobó a través de los Servicios. 
* Si estamos obligados a hacerlo por ley o proceso legal, como para cumplir con cualquier orden judicial o citación o para responder a cualquier solicitud gubernamental o regulatoria; 
* Si creemos que la divulgación es necesaria o apropiada para proteger los derechos, la propiedad o la seguridad de Subsplash, de nuestros clientes u otros, incluso para: (1) proteger la seguridad de un menor de edad; (2) proteger la seguridad de los Servicios; o (3) permitirnos tomar precauciones contra la responsabilidad civil; o 
* A las agencias de orden público o para una investigación relacionada con la seguridad pública. 

En cualquier momento, puede revisar la información personal de su hijo guardada por nosotros, exigirnos que corrijamos o borremos la información personal y/o negarse a permitirnos seguir recopilando o usando la información del menor. 

Puede revisar, cambiar o borrar la información personal de su hijo al: 

* Iniciar la sesión en su cuenta; o 
* Enviando una solicitud [aquí](https://subsplash.com/legal/data-request), o enviándonos un correo electrónico a privacy@subsplash.com. Para proteger su privacidad y seguridad, es posible que le solicitemos que tome ciertas medidas o proporcione información adicional para verificar su identidad antes de darle cualquier información o corregirla.

responsabilidad civil según los Principios si su agente procesa dicha información personal de una manera inconsistente con los Principios, a menos que la organización pruebe que no es responsable del suceso que dio lugar al daño. 

**Divulgaciones a terceros**

Subsplash no divulgará información personal a terceros sin notificar a las personas que es posible que lleven a cabo dicha divulgación. En las ocasiones en que Subsplash recopile información de las personas, antes de divulgar la información personal a terceros, Subsplash les notificará a las personas el hecho de que es posible que se divulgue su información. Si las personas no desean que su información personal se divulgue a terceros, la persona no debe inscribirse para dichos servicios de Subsplash. En lo que se refiera a Subsplash Giving, la información del donante se compartirá con el Destinatario del Regalo. El Destinatario del Regalo puede utilizar un tercero con el objetivo de recibir y administrar dicha información y los donantes deben revisar las politicas de privacidad del Destinatario de Regalo respecto a esto.

**b\]** Arbitraje obligatorio

Si sus demandas sobre la información cubierta por el Escudo de Privacidad UE-EE. UU. no se han remediado por medio de la resolución de disputas directamente con Subsplash o por medio de la resolución de disputas independiente como se indica anteriormente, dichas "demandas residuales" pueden ser escuchadas por un "Panel del Escudo de Privacidad" compuesto por uno o tres árbitros según acuerden las partes.

Es posible que no se otorguen daños, costos, gastos y otras reparaciones y cada una de las partes corre por su cuenta con sus propios honorarios de abogados. La opción del arbitraje solo está disponible para que una persona determine sobre dichas "demandas residuales", si Subsplash ha cometido con esa persona una violación de sus obligaciones según los Principios y si dicha violación sigue sin remediarse total o parcialmente.

**c\]** (GDPR) Reglamento General De Protección De Datos

El GDPR reemplaza a la Directiva 95/46/EC y tiene vigencia desde el 25 de mayo de 2018 La intención de la siguiente declaración es complementar la lo que se ha tratado anteriormente sobre el Escudo de Privacidad de la UE-EE. UU En cuanto a los datos personales recopilados y controlados por Subsplash sujetos a las calificaciones y limitaciones manifestadas en lo tratado anteriormente, los interesados de la UE conservan sus plenos derechos a ser informados de los objetivos de nuestras actividades de procesamiento al recolectar la información; de retirar el consentimiento; de acceder, rectificar, transportar y borrar sus datos personales; de oponerse al procesamiento para esfuerzos del marketing directo; y a tener objeciones cuando estén sujetos a decisiones de procesamiento automatizado. En lo que se refiere a la información personal recopilada por terceros y que Subsplash solo procesa, los interesados de la UE deben ponerse en contacto con el responsable (por ejemplo, la iglesia o ministerio) con respecto a sus derechos a ser informados de los objetivos de nuestras actividades de procesamiento en el momento de la recopilación;retirar el consentimiento; acceder, rectificar, transportar y borrar sus datos personales; oponerse al procesamiento para esfuerzos de marketing directo; y objetar cuando estén sujetos a decisiones de procesamiento automatizado. Dichos derechos pueden estar sujetos a ciertas calificaciones y limitaciones según se ha manifestado al tratar sobre el Escudo de Privacidad de la UE-EE. UU. 

Nuestros Oficiales de Procesamiento de Datos ayudarán gratis a los residentes de la UE con estas solicitudes y pueden ser contactados en privacy@subsplash.com 

Subsplash comprende que adoptar prácticas globales de seguridad no es una actividad que ocurra una sola vez. El enfoque "privacidad por diseño" de Subsplash exije que nuestros niveles por defecto de la protección de datos del usuario tengan por defecto la configuración más alta. En el caso improbable de incumplimiento, Subsplash notificará a los interesados y a las Autoridades de Supervisión (SA) en la UE de acuerdo con los procedimientos dispuestos en los artículos 33 y 34 del GDPR. 

Nosotros no recopilamos intencionalmente datos personales de menores y no adaptamos ningún servicio a ellos.

Dernière mise à jour le 27 septembre 2022 – Version 4.6

La présente politique de protection de la vie privée décrit la collecte, l’utilisation, la protection, la divulgation, la correction et la suppression de vos Informations à caractère personnel par Subsplash. Veuillez prendre le temps de lire ce qui suit afin d’en savoir plus sur nos pratiques en matière d’informations, notamment le type d’informations qui sont recueillies, comment elles sont utilisées et à quelles fins, à qui nous divulguons ces informations et de quelle façon nous protégeons vos Informations à caractère personnel. La protection de votre vie privée est une priorité chez Subsplash, et nous faisons beaucoup d’efforts pour la protéger.

La présente politique de protection de la vie privée s’applique aux sites Web hébergés sur subsplash.com et thechurchapp.com, y compris toutes les pages secondaires et les nouvelles versions de ces pages, ainsi que tous les logiciels et services que nous offrons, y compris notamment les services que nous offrons par le biais de nos sites Web lorsque vous vous inscrivez à un compte Subsplash (collectivement appelés les « Services de compte Subsplash »).

Subsplash peut de temps à autre mettre à jour sa politique de protection de la vie privée. Lorsque nous modifions la politique de façon importante, un avis est affiché sur notre site Web avec la politique de protection de la vie privée actualisée.

### POURQUOI RECUEILLONS-NOUS DES INFORMATIONS À CARACTÈRE PERSONNEL

Nous recueillons des Informations à caractère personnel pour les raisons suivantes:

* Elles aident Subsplash à fournir et à gérer vos Services de compte Subsplash
* Elles aident Subsplash à fournir à la clientèle un service de qualité supérieure
* Elles permettent à Subsplash de vous donner un accès pratique à nos produits et services et de mettre l’accent sur les catégories les plus intéressantes pour vous
* Elles aident Subsplash à vous tenir informé des dernières annonces de produits, des mises à jour logicielles, des offres spéciales et des événements susceptibles de vous intéresser. Si vous ne souhaitez pas que Subsplash vous informe des actualités, des mises à jour logicielles et des plus récentes informations sur les produits et services de Subsplash, veuillez soumettre votre demande [ici](https://www.subsplash.com/legal/data-request) ou nous envoyer un courrier électronique à l’adresse privacy@subsplash.com.

### QUELLES INFORMATIONS RECUEILLONS-NOUS, À QUEL MOMENT ET COMMENT POUVONS-NOUS LES UTILISER

Si vous souhaitez utiliser les Services de compte Subsplash, Subsplash a besoin de vos informations aux fins de traitement et de transmission des informations pour véhiculer les données et contenu adéquats entre les serveurs et les applications et vous assurer ainsi une bonne expérience.

Il y a également certaines situations pour lesquelles vos Informations à caractère personnel peuvent nous aider à vous offrir un meilleur service. Par exemple:

* Nous pouvons vous demander vos Informations à caractère personnel lorsque vous parlez au téléphone avec l’un de nos collaborateurs au sujet d’un problème de service, que vous téléchargez une mise à jour logicielle, que vous vous inscrivez à un séminaire, que vous participez à un enquête en ligne, que vous enregistrez vos produits ou que vous achetez un produit
* Lors de votre interaction avec Subsplash, nous pouvons recueillir des Informations à caractère personnel pertinentes à la situation, comme votre nom, votre adresse postale, votre numéro de téléphone, votre courrier électronique et votre mode de contact de préférence, les informations de votre carte de crédit et les informations concernant les produits Subsplash que vous possédez, comme leurs numéros de série et leur date d’achat, et les informations concernant un problème de support ou de service
* Nous recueillons des informations concernant les activités de nos clients sur nos sites Web et nos applications. Cela nous aide à déterminer comment fournir au mieux des informations pertinentes aux clients et à comprendre quelles parties de nos sites Web, quels produits et services Internet sont les plus intéressants pour eux, ainsi qu’à diagnostiquer des problèmes avec nos services et nos sites Web
* Lorsque vous visitez l’application mobile Subsplash, nous pouvons vous demander de consentir à nous permettre d’utiliser la technologie GPS (ou une autre technologie similaire) pour déterminer votre position actuelle aux fins de production de rapports sur l’activité et l’engagement des utilisateurs. Si vous ne voulez pas que nous utilisions votre localisation aux fins susmentionnées, il vous faut ne pas y consentir ou alors désactiver les services de localisation pour l’application mobile Subsplash situés dans les réglages de votre compte, dans les réglages de votre téléphone portable ou dans l’application mobile;
* Nous pouvons utiliser des Informations à caractère personnel pour fournir des produits et/ou des services que vous avez demandés, ainsi qu’à des fins d’audit, de recherche et d’analyse pour améliorer les produits Subsplash
* Si vous utilisez la fonctionnalité de messagerie Subsplash, Subsplash stocke le contenu de vos messages, qui peuvent contenir des Informations à caractère personnel, et ainsi obtenir le numéro de votre appareil portable ou votre adresse électronique et demander l’accès aux contacts de votre appareil portable afin d’accéder seulement au numéro de téléphone et/ou à l’adresse électronique des personnes en particulier que vous choisissez de contacter par le service de messagerie et de stocker ces informations – Subsplash ne copiera aucune coordonnée de personnes avec qui vous ne communiquez pas à l’aide du service de messagerie. En ce qui concerne les coordonnées des personnes particulières que vous contactez à l’aide du service de messagerie, Subsplash n’utilisera ces informations que dans le but de fournir le service et ne les utilisera à aucune autre fin
* Si vous vous inscrivez à la messagerie Subsplash, telle que décrite ci-dessus, et que vous choisissez d’inviter d’autres utilisateurs à se joindre à une conversation, Subsplash demandera l’accès à vos contacts, même si ce n’est pas obligatoire pour inviter d’autres utilisateurs à votre conversation. Subsplash n’utilisera cet accès que pour vous permettre d’inviter d’autres utilisateurs
* Subsplash peut utiliser des formes agrégées et anonymes d’Informations à caractère personnel à diverses fins, notamment pour analyser les tendances de l’usage, la détection de fraude et l’élaboration de nouveaux services.

### LES INFORMATIONS AFFICHÉES PUBLIQUEMENT SONT PUBLIQUES 

Si vous utilisez un tableau d’affichage, un service de diffusion en continu ou un espace de chat sur un site Web ou un service Subsplash, sachez que toute information que vous partagez est visible par d’autres utilisateurs. Les renseignements permettant de vous identifier que vous soumettez sur l’un de ces forums peuvent être lus, recueillis ou utilisés par quiconque pour vous envoyer des messages non sollicités. Subsplash n’est pas responsable des renseignements permettant de vous identifier que vous choisissez de soumettre sur ces forums. Par exemple, si vous choisissez de rendre publique une information qui était auparavant non publique, en la révélant dans ces forums ou en autorisant certaines fonctionnalités d’utilisateur, Subsplash recueillera cette information de votre interaction et l’information sera rendue publique.

### QUAND DIVULGUONS-NOUS VOS INFORMATIONS

Subsplash prend la protection de votre vie privée très au sérieux. Subsplash ne vend pas et ne loue pas vos coordonnées à d’autres spécialistes du marketing ni à aucun autre tiers. Si vous souhaitez utiliser les Services de compte Subsplash, Subsplash divulgue vos informations aux institutions et aux prestataires de services tiers aux fins de traitement et de transmission des informations pour véhiculer les données et contenu adéquats entre les serveurs et les applications et vous assurer ainsi une bonne expérience. Si vous invitez d’autres utilisateurs sur l’un de nos services, nous pouvons dire à la ou aux personnes que vous invitez qui les a invitées. Subsplash peut partager avec des tiers des formes agrégées et anonymes d’Informations à caractère personnel et, dans ce cas, les informations partagées le seront sous une forme dépersonnalisée et non identifiable.

### AU SEIN DU GROUPE SUBSPLASH

Subsplash, Inc. et Subsplash Wallet, LLC exercent toutes deux leurs activités sous le nom de « Subsplash » et en tant que groupe. Pour nous aider à offrir un service supérieur, vos Informations à caractère personnel peuvent être partagées avec des personnes morales du groupe Subsplash au niveau mondial, qui prendra des mesures raisonnables pour les protéger conformément à la politique de protection de la vie privée de Subsplash.

### AVEC NOS PRESTATAIRES DE SERVICES, SOUS-TRAITANTS ET PARTENAIRES STRATÉGIQUES

Il y a aussi des moments où il peut être avantageux pour Subsplash de mettre certaines de vos Informations à caractère personnel à la disposition d’entreprises avec qui Subsplash entretient une relation stratégique ou qui exécutent des travaux pour Subsplash afin de fournir des produits et services en notre nom. Ces entreprises peuvent nous aider à traiter les informations, à accorder un crédit, à exécuter les commandes des clients, à vous livrer des produits, à gérer et à améliorer les données clientèle, à assurer le service à la clientèle, à évaluer votre intérêt pour nos produits et services, ou à effectuer des recherches sur la clientèle ou des enquêtes de satisfaction. Ces entreprises sont également tenues de protéger vos Informations à caractère personnel en stricte conformité avec les politiques de Subsplash, sauf si nous vous indiquons le contraire au moment de la collecte. Sans la mise à disposition de ces informations, il vous serait difficile d’acheter nos produits, que ces produits vous soient livrés, de recevoir un service à la clientèle, de nous faire part de vos commentaires pour améliorer nos produits et services, ou d’avoir accès à certains services, offres ou contenu sur le site Web de Subsplash.

### PROMOTIONS PARTENAIRES

Nous pouvons proposer des concours, loteries ou autres promotions avec des partenaires tiers. Si vous décidez de participer à un concours, une loterie ou autre promotion parrainé(e) et/ou en association avec un partenaire tiers, les informations que vous fournissez seront partagées avec nous et avec eux. Leur utilisation de vos informations n'est pas régie par la présente Politique de protection de la vie privée.

### TRANSFERTS D'ENTREPRISES

Nous pouvons choisir d'acheter ou de vendre des actifs et pouvons partager et/ou transférer des informations clients, y compris des Informations à caractère personnel, dans le cadre de l'évaluation et de la conclusion de ces opérations et sur la base de nos intérêts légitimes. En outre, si nos actifs ou nous sommes rachetés, si nous cessons nos activités, si nous faisons faillite ou si nous subissons un changement de contrôle, les Informations à caractère personnel peuvent être l'un des actifs transférés ou rachetés par un tiers.

### REQUÊTES LÉGALES

Parfois, la loi ou un litige peut nous contraindre à divulguer vos Informations à caractère personnel. Nous pouvons aussi divulguer des informations à votre sujet si nous déterminons de façon raisonnable que la divulgation est nécessaire pour des raisons de sécurité nationale, d’application de la loi ou d’autres questions d’importance publique.

### SUBSPLASH GIVING

Subsplash Giving est une fonctionnalité connectée à Internet qui peut être utilisée sur un navigateur Web et des appareils mobiles. Elle a été élaborée par Subsplash pour permettre aux donateurs de faire des dons d’argent à des organisations tierces. Si vous choisissez d’utiliser la fonctionnalité Subsplash Giving pour faire des dons, Subsplash et l’organisme de traitement des paiements recueilleront des Informations à caractère personnel à votre sujet, y compris votre nom, vos coordonnées, les sommes des dons, et l’organisme de traitement des paiements recevra certaines informations sur le paiement (p. ex. numéro de carte de crédit, adresse de facturation, code de sécurité) et utilisera ces informations pour traiter les paiements et vous fournir des relevés de transaction. Les informations du donateur seront partagées avec le bénéficiaire du don.

Lorsque vous envoyez un SMS à Subsplash ou à Subsplash Wallet dans le but d’utiliser la fonctionnalité de dons par SMS, vous divulguez votre numéro de téléphone portable à Subsplash, Inc., et vous consentez par conséquent à recevoir par SMS un hyperlien vers le portail de dons Subsplash Wallet. Pour cesser de recevoir des SMS de Subsplash ou de Subsplash Wallet, répondez au SMS en tapant « STOP ».

### SUBSPLASH LIVE

Subsplash Live utilise les services API de YouTube, régis par les Règles de protection de la vie privée de Google ([https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)), pour accéder au nom de chaîne YouTube et à l’identifiant de votre organisation, ainsi que pour créer des diffusions de vidéo et des radiodiffusions en direct au nom de votre organisation. Nous faisons cela pour afficher la chaîne liée dans votre tableau de bord Subsplash et pour créer des radiodiffusions en direct groupées sur cette chaîne. En plus de la procédure normale de Subsplash pour supprimer les données stockées, votre organisation peut révoquer l’accès de Subsplash Live à vos données YouTube par le biais de la page des réglages de sécurité Google ([https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions)). Veuillez contacter Subsplash pour toute question ou plainte au sujet des pratiques de protection de la vie privée de Subsplash Live.

### COOKIES ET AUTRES TECHNOLOGIES

Comme cela est pratique courante sur de nombreux sites Web d’entreprises, les sites Web de Subsplash utilisent des « cookies » et d’autres technologies pour nous aider à comprendre quelles parties de nos sites Web sont les plus populaires, où vont les visiteurs et le temps qu’ils y passent. Nous utilisons aussi des cookies et d’autres technologies pour nous assurer que nos publicités en ligne attirent des clients vers nos produits et services. Les cookies contiennent des informations qui sont transférées sur le disque dur de votre ordinateur. Ces cookies servent à stocker des informations comme l’heure à laquelle la visite en cours a lieu, si le visiteur est déjà venu sur le site auparavant et quel site a renvoyé le visiteur à la page Web.

Cependant, si vous préférez ne pas autoriser les cookies, vous pouvez les désactiver dans votre navigateur. Veuillez noter que certaines fonctionnalités des sites Web de Subsplash et certains produits en ligne de Subsplash ne seront pas disponibles si les cookies sont désactivés. Comme c’est le cas de la plupart des sites Web, nous recueillons automatiquement certaines informations et les stockons dans des fichiers journaux. Ces informations sont, entre autres, les adresses de protocole Internet (IP), le type de navigateur, le fournisseur d’accès à Internet (FAI), les pages de renvoi ou de sortie, le système d’exploitation, l’estampille date/heure et les données du flux de clics. Nous pouvons également suivre les données liées à l’utilisation, comme la fréquence à laquelle vous visitez notre site ou utilisez nos applications, combien de messages vous envoyez et la façon dont vous utilisez notre contenu.

Nous utilisons aussi Google Analytics. Google Analytics est un outil d’analyse Web qui aide les propriétaires de sites Web à comprendre comment les utilisateurs utilisent leur site Web.  

Comme la plupart des services, Google Analytics utilise des cookies internes pour suivre les interactions des visiteurs comme dans notre cas, où ils servent à recueillir des informations au sujet de la façon dont les visiteurs utilisent notre site. Nous utilisons ensuite les informations pour compiler des rapports et nous aider à améliorer notre site.

Nous pouvons aussi utiliser d’autres outils de Google Analytics, comme leur outil de données démographiques et centres d’intérêt qui nous permet d’en apprendre davantage sur les caractéristiques et les intérêts des utilisateurs qui visitent notre site Web, ou leur outil de remarketing, qui nous permet de placer des publicités pertinentes sur différents sites Web et services en ligne.

Google Analytics recueille des informations de façon anonyme et produit des rapports sur les tendances des sites Web sans identifier les visiteurs individuels. Vous pouvez désactiver Google Analytics sans que cela affecte la façon dont vous visitez notre site – pour obtenir plus d’information sur la désactivation du suivi par Google Analytics sur les sites Web que vous utilisez, consultez cette [page Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Nous utilisons ces informations pour analyser les tendances, gérer le site, suivre les mouvements des utilisateurs sur le site et recueillir des informations démographiques au sujet de notre base d’utilisateurs dans son ensemble.

Dans certains de nos courriers électroniques, nous nous servons d’un lien « URL de clic » lié au contenu sur le site Web de Subsplash. Lorsque les clients cliquent sur l’un de ces liens URL, ils passent par le serveur de notre site Web avant d’arriver à la page de destination. Nous suivons ces données de clics pour nous aider à déterminer l’intérêt pour des sujets précis et mesurer l’efficacité de nos communications avec nos clients. Si vous préférez ne pas faire l’objet d’un suivi, évitez simplement de cliquer sur les liens textuels ou graphiques dans les courriers électroniques. En outre, nous utilisons des pixels invisibles – de minuscules images graphiques – pour nous indiquer quelles parties de notre site Web les clients ont visitées ou pour mesurer l’efficacité des recherches effectuées par les clients sur notre site.

Les pixels invisibles nous permettent aussi d’envoyer des courriers électroniques dans un format que les clients peuvent lire. Et ces pixels nous indiquent si les courriers électroniques ont été ouverts pour nous assurer que nous n’envoyons que des messages qui ont de l’intérêt pour nos clients. Nous pouvons utiliser ces informations pour réduire ou éliminer les messages envoyés au client.

### COMMENT NOUS PROTÉGEONS VOS INFORMATIONS À CARACTÈRE PERSONNEL

Subsplash prend des précautions – y compris des mesures administratives, techniques et physiques – pour protéger vos Informations à caractère personnel contre la perte, le vol et l’usage abusif, ainsi que l’accès, la divulgation, l’altération et la destruction non autorisés. Les sites Web de Subsplash utilisent le chiffrement par couche de sockets sécurisée (protocole SSL) sur toutes les pages Web où des Informations à caractère personnel sont requises. Pour effectuer des achats sur la boutique en ligne de Subsplash ou par le biais de vos comptes Subsplash, vous devez utiliser un navigateur qui autorise le protocole SSL, comme Safari, Google ou Internet Explorer. Vous protégez ainsi la confidentialité de vos Informations à caractère personnel et de vos cartes de crédit lors de leur transmission sur Internet. Vous pouvez nous aider en prenant des précautions pour protéger vos données à caractère personnel lorsque vous êtes sur Internet. Modifiez souvent vos mots de passe en utilisant une combinaison de lettres et de chiffres, et assurez-vous d’utiliser un navigateur Web sûr comme Safari ou Google.  

### INTÉGRITÉ DE VOS INFORMATIONS À CARACTÈRE PERSONNEL

Subsplash vous permet de conserver vos Informations à caractère personnel exactes, complètes et à jour. Naturellement, vous avez le droit d’accéder aux Informations à caractère personnel que vous avez fournies, de les corriger et de les supprimer, même si vous ne pouvez pas supprimer toutes les informations si vous voulez maintenir un compte Subsplash et que Subsplash a l’obligation de conserver certaines informations concernant les transactions et les donateurs de Subsplash Giving. En dépit de nos efforts sincères, des erreurs surviennent parfois. Si vous trouvez une quelconque information personnelle qui est périmée, inexacte ou incomplète, indiquez-le-nous, nous effectuerons les corrections rapidement et nous ferons tous les efforts nécessaires pour communiquer ces changements à d’autres parties qui pourraient avoir reçu par inadvertance de notre part des Informations à caractère personnel inexactes ou périmées. Si vous supprimez vos informations, cette suppression peut empêcher Subsplash de continuer à vous offrir certains ou tous les services de compte Subsplash.

Subsplash ne conserve les Informations à caractère personnel que tant que nous sommes dans l’obligation de le faire pour notre relation d’affaires ou comme l’exigent des lois fédérales, d’État ou provinciales, sous réserve des pratiques raisonnables de l’industrie en matière de conservation de documents. Subsplash a des procédures adéquates en place concernant la destruction, la suppression et l’élimination des Informations à caractère personnel lorsqu’elles ne sont plus requises par Subsplash, sous réserve des lois applicables.  

### ENFANTS

Subsplash reconnaît que les parents, tuteurs et autres adultes achètent souvent nos produits en vue d’une utilisation familiale, y compris une utilisation par des mineurs. Nous ne recueillons pas sciemment d’Informations à caractère personnel concernant des enfants âgés de moins de 13 ans à des fins commerciales, mais comme certaines informations sont recueillies par voie électronique, elles peuvent apparaître comme étant les Informations à caractère personnel de l’acheteur Subsplash du produit et elles seront traitées comme telles par la présente politique de protection de la vie privée. Si un enfant de moins de 13 ans soumet des Informations à caractère personnel à Subsplash sans le consentement d’un parent ou d’un tuteur et que nous apprenons que ces informations sont celles d’un enfant de moins de 13 ans, nous supprimerons les informations dès que possible.

Jamais nous ne partagerons, vendrons, louerons ou transférerons les Informations à caractère personnel d’un enfant autrement que selon la description de la présente section.

Nous pouvons divulguer des informations agrégées au sujet d’un grand nombre de nos utilisateurs qui peuvent comprendre des informations agrégées qui n’identifient personne en particulier. En outre, nous pouvons divulguer les Informations à caractère personnel d’enfants:

* À des tiers que le parent ou tuteur a approuvés par le biais des services

* Si nous sommes contraints de le faire par la loi ou une procédure judiciaire, comme pour nous conformer à tout ordre d’un tribunal ou toute assignation à comparaître, ou pour répondre à toute demande gouvernementale ou règlementaire
* Si nous croyons que la divulgation est nécessaire ou appropriée pour protéger les droits, la propriété ou la sécurité de Subsplash, de nos clients ou d’autres personnes, notamment pour : 1) protéger la sécurité d’un enfant; 2) protéger la sûreté et la sécurité des services; ou 3) nous permettre de prendre des précautions en matière de responsabilité. 
* Aux organismes d’application de la loi ou pour une enquête relative à la sécurité publique.

Vous pouvez à tout moment examiner les Informations à caractère personnel de votre enfant que nous conservons, nous demander de corriger ou de supprimer ces informations et/ou refuser de nous permettre de continuer à en recueillir ou d’utiliser les informations de l’enfant.

Vous pouvez examiner, modifier ou supprimer les Informations à caractère personnel de votre enfant en:

* Vous connectant à votre compte ou en
* Soumettant une demande [ici](https://subsplash.com/legal/data-request) ou en nous envoyant un courrier électronique à l’adresse privacy@subsplash.com. Pour protéger votre vie privée et votre sécurité, nous pouvons vous demander d’effectuer certaines démarches ou de fournir des informations supplémentaires pour vérifier votre identité avant de vous donner une quelconque information ou d’apporter des corrections.

### CLIENTS CANADIENS

Nos politiques et pratiques ont été conçues de manière à être conformes à la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et les documents électroniques (Canada), à la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels (Canada) et à toutes les lois provinciales qui réglementent le traitement des renseignements personnels dans les secteurs privé et public.

 Selon le lieu où se trouvent les utilisateurs des Services de compte Subsplash, il peut être possible d’avoir accès aux informations sur les Services de compte Subsplash, y compris le site Web de Subsplash, hors du Canada ou de pouvoir les envoyer à d’autres personnes hors du Canada. Veuillez noter que pour toute information personnelle qui est envoyée hors du Canada, un accès peut être octroyé aux services d’application de la loi et aux autorités gouvernementales ayant compétence dans les pays où l’information est située.

Dans le cas où un différend entre vous et Subsplash au sujet de vos Informations à caractère personnel ou de la présente politique n’est pas résolu conformément à la section « Règlement des différends » ci-après  dans les trente (30) jours, l’une ou l’autre des parties peut consulter le commissaire à la protection de la vie privée du Canada ou un commissaire à la protection de la vie privée provincial pertinent.

Avis de protection de la vie privée pour les résidents de l’UE

La présente section régit les données à caractère personnel concernant une personne physique identifiée ou identifiable, uniquement recueillies auprès de personnes situées dans l’Union européenne (UE).

Information sur le Règlement général sur la protection des données (« GDPR »)

L’information qui suit décrit nos engagements envers vous en vertu du Règlement général sur la protection des données (« GDPR ») de l’UE.

Le GDPR fait la distinction entre les organisations qui traitent des données à caractère personnel à des fins qui leur sont propres (connues comme étant des « responsables de traitement des données ») et celles qui traitent des données à caractère personnel pour le compte d’autres organisations (connues comme étant des « prestataires de services de traitement de données »). Subsplash agit uniquement comme responsable de traitement de données pour des types très limités de données, comme les informations que vous saisissez lorsque vous ouvrez un compte chez nous ou les informations que vous soumettez lorsque vous achetez notre logiciel. Subsplash est le responsable de traitement de données pour les informations données par nos utilisateurs lorsque nous fournissons nos services. Subsplash est le prestataire de services de traitement de données pour les informations données par nos partenaires tiers lorsqu’ils nous fournissent des services, tels que nos partenaires de paiement qui traitent les paiements au nom de nos utilisateurs.

Quand agissons-nous en qualité de responsable de traitement de données

Lorsque nous traitons vos données en tant que responsable de traitement de données, les règles suivantes s’appliquent. 

Nous recueillons, utilisons et partageons vos données à caractère personnel lorsque nous sommes convaincus que nous disposons de la base juridique appropriée pour le faire. Cela peut être: 

* Par consentement : notre utilisation de vos données à caractère personnel est conforme à votre consentement. Si nous traitons vos données à caractère personnel en fonction de votre consentement, nous vous demanderont ce consentement au moment ou avant la collecte de données. Vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment et ne subirez aucun préjudice pour avoir retiré votre consentement.
* Par contrat : notre utilisation de vos données à caractère personnel sert à honorer un contrat entre vous et nous.
* Par obligation légale : notre utilisation de vos données à caractère personnel est nécessaire pour nous conformer à une obligation légale ou réglementaire que nous avons (par exemple, lorsque nous sommes obligés de divulguer des données à caractère personnel à un tribunal ou de stocker des informations en raison de règlements financiers fédéraux).
* Par intérêt légitime : notre utilisation de vos données à caractère personnel est d’un intérêt légitime pour nous, comme prévenir la fraude et assurer la sécurité de notre réseau.

Sous réserve de certaines exceptions et dans certains cas, selon l'activité de traitement, les résidents de l’UE ont certains droits en ce qui concerne leurs données à caractère personnel: 

* Droit d’accès : vous avez le droit d’accès à vos données à caractère personnel lorsqu’elles sont traitées ; vous pouvez en particulier demander de voir vos données à caractère personnel et obtenir des copies de vos données à caractère personnel.
* Droit de rectification : vous avez le droit de demander des modifications à vos données à caractère personnel si elles sont périmées ou inexactes. Dans certaines circonstances, vous pouvez exercer ce droit, en tout ou en partie, par le biais de votre compte existant chez nous.
* Droit à l’effacement : vous avez le droit de demander que nous supprimions vos données à caractère personnel. Cependant, nous ne sommes pas tenus de nous conformer à votre demande d’effacement de vos données à caractère personnel si le traitement de vos données à caractère personnel est nécessaire pour nous conformer à une obligation légale ou en vue de la constatation, de l’exercice ou de la défense de droits en justice.
* Droit à la limitation du traitement : dans certaines circonstances, vous avez le droit de demander une limitation du traitement de vos données à caractère personnel. Vous avez le droit de limiter l’utilisation de vos données à caractère personnel. Cependant, nous pouvons continuer à utiliser vos données à caractère personnel après une demande de limitation a) lorsque nous avons votre consentement; b) pour la constatation, l’exercice ou la défense de droits en justice ou c) pour la protection des droits d’une autre personne physique ou morale.
* Droit à la portabilité des données : dans la mesure où nous traitons vos informations i) sur la base de votre consentement ou dans le cadre d’un contrat et ii) par des moyens automatisés, vous avez le droit de recevoir ces données à caractère personnel dans un format structuré, couramment utilisé et lisible par une machine ou vous pouvez demander qu’elles soient transmises directement à un autre responsable de traitement des données.
* Droit d’opposition : vous avez le droit de vous opposer au traitement de vos données à caractère personnel. Toutefois, nous pourrons encore traiter vos données si nous démontrons qu’il existe des motifs légitimes et impérieux pour le traitement qui prévalent sur les intérêts, les droits et les libertés de la personne concernée ou pour la constatation, l’exercice ou la défense de droits en justice.
* Droit de s’opposer au traitement automatisé : vous avez le droit de vous opposer à faire l’objet d’une décision fondée sur un traitement automatisé, comme lorsqu’un ordinateur évalue des facteurs dans les données que nous recueillons à votre sujet et prend une décision. Nous ne prenons actuellement aucune décision fondée sur un traitement automatisé. 

Nous conservons vos données à caractère personnel aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour vous fournir nos services, ou à d’autres fins importantes, comme celles de nous conformer à des obligations légales, de régler des différends et d’imposer le respect de nos accords. 

Nous vous demandons de bien vouloir tenter de résoudre tout problème concernant la protection de vos données ou nous demander de le faire avant de contacter l’autorité de contrôle pertinente. Si vous souhaitez exercer l’un des droits décrits ci-dessus, veuillez en envoyer la demande à l’adresse privacy@subsplash.com. Veuillez indiquer dans votre message le droit que vous souhaitez exercer et les informations que vous souhaitez consulter, réviser, corriger ou supprimer.

Nous pouvons vous demander des informations supplémentaires pour confirmer votre identité et à des fins de sécurité avant de divulguer les données à caractère personnel demandées.

Il se peut que nous ne soyons pas toujours pleinement en mesure de répondre à votre demande, par exemple si cela affecterait le devoir de protection de la vie privée que nous avons envers les autres ou si nous sommes légalement autorisés à traiter la demande d’une manière différente.

Lorsque Subsplash agit comme prestataire de services de traitement des données

Lorsque nous traitons vos données en notre qualité de prestataire de services de traitement des données, le traitement de vos données ne sera pas régi par les dispositions qui précèdent (« Lorsque nous agissons comme responsable des données »), mais vous pouvez contacter directement le responsable des données pour connaître son traitement de vos informations et pour exercer vos droits, ou nous leur transmettrons directement votre demande, si vous nous le demandez.

L’approche de Subsplash basée sur la protection de la vie privée dès la conception {« privacy by design ») exige que les niveaux de protection des données de nos utilisateurs soient automatiquement réglés par défaut au niveau le plus élevé. Dans le cas peu probable d’une violation de données à caractère personnel, Subsplash avisera les personnes concernées et les autorités de contrôle de l’UE selon les procédures indiquées aux Articles 33 et 34 du GDPR.  

### CADRE DU BOUCLIER DE PROTECTION DES DONNÉES  (« PRIVACY SHIELD ») UE–USA

Les dispositions suivantes régissent les informations recueillies en s’appuyant sur les principes du Privacy Shield UE–USA pour les transferts de données à caractère personnel de l’UE vers les États-Unis. Subsplash adhère aux principes du Privacy Shield (ci-après les « Principes ») et s’engage à soumettre aux Principes toutes les données à caractère personnel en provenance de l’UE en s’appuyant sur le cadre du Privacy Shield. Les personnes auprès desquelles Subsplash recueille des données à caractère personnel dans le cadre du Privacy Shield ont le droit d’accéder à leurs données à caractère personnel en contactant Subsplash [ici](https://www.subsplash.com/legal/data-request) ou à l’adresse privacy@subsplash.com. En tant qu’entreprise certifiée du Privacy Shield, Subsplash est assujettie aux pouvoirs d’enquête et d’application de la loi de la Federal Trade Commission ou de toute autre entité réglementaire autorisée aux États-Unis.

  
Vous pouvez accéder à la Liste du Privacy Shield [ici](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

**Avis et choix**

Lorsque Subsplash recueille des Informations à caractère personnel auprès de personnes physiques, elle peut partager ces informations avec des organisations clientes ou des tiers comme décrit ci-dessus dans la Politique de protection de la vie privée. Il incombe à ces personnes d’examiner la politique de protection de la vie privée de l’organisation cliente ; elles auront ensuite le choix de s’abonner ou non aux services de Subsplash. Au moment de s’abonner aux services de Subsplash, un lien vers la politique de protection de la vie privée de Subsplash leur sera fourni lorsque leur seront demandées leurs Informations à caractère personnel.

Dans le cas où Subsplash n’est pas le responsable ni le collecteur des Informations à caractère personnel, mais uniquement le prestataire de services de traitement des données, elle n’a pas les moyens de donner le choix ni les moyens de limiter l’utilisation et la divulgation des Informations à caractère personnel ou d’aviser lorsque ces personnes sont invitées à fournir des Informations à caractère personnel à Subsplash. Dans ces cas là, Subsplash suivra les instructions du responsable de ces informations, fournira les mesures techniques et organisationnelles appropriées pour protéger les données à caractère personnel contre la destruction accidentelle ou illégale ou la perte accidentelle, l’altération, la divulgation ou l’accès non autorisé et, dans la mesure où cela est approprié, aider le responsable à répondre aux personnes exerçant leurs droits en vertu des Principes.

Dans le contexte d’une transmission ultérieure, Subsplash est chargée de traiter les Informations à caractère personnel qu’elle reçoit en vertu du Privacy Shield et de les transférer ultérieurement à un tiers agissant comme agent en son nom. Subsplash demeure responsable en vertu des Principes si son agent traite ces Informations à caractère personnel de façon incompatible avec les Principes, sauf si l’organisation prouve qu’elle n’est pas responsable de l’événement donnant lieu au préjudice.

**Divulgation à des tiers**

Subsplash ne saurait divulguer des Informations à caractère personnel à des tiers sans informer les personnes concernées qu’une telle divulgation peut avoir lieu. Dans les cas où Subsplash recueille des informations à caractère personnel auprès de personnes concernées avant de divulguer les Informations à caractère personnel à un tiers, Subsplash est tenu d’informer la personne concernée du fait que ses Informations à caractère personnel peuvent être divulguées. Si ces personnes ne souhaitent pas que leurs Informations à caractère personnel soient divulguées à un quelconque tiers, il leur convient de ne pas s’inscrire aux services de Subsplash. En ce qui concerne Subsplash Giving, les informations du donateur sont partagées avec le bénéficiaire du don. Le bénéficiaire du don peut utiliser un tiers pour la réception et la gestion de ces informations et il incombe aux donateurs d’examiner les politiques de protection de la vie privée du bénéficiaire de don à cet égard.

Dans le cas de tiers (par exemple les églises) pour qui Subsplash recueille des Informations à caractère personnel, Subsplash doit conclure un contrat qui stipule que ces données ne peuvent être traitées qu’à des fins limitées et précisées qui soient conformes avec le consentement fourni et que ces tiers fourniront le même niveau de protection qu’exigent les Principes. Pour les agents bénéficiaires tiers (par exemple les prestataires de services de traitement des paiements) d’Informations à caractère personnel, Subsplash est tenu de ne transférer ces données qu’à des fins limitées et précisées, vérifier que l’agent a l’obligation de fournir au moins le même niveau de protection de la vie privée qu’exigent les Principes; et, à la réception d’un avis, de prendre des mesures raisonnables et appropriées pour arrêter un traitement non autorisé et y remédier.

**Sécurité des données**

Subsplash est tenu de prendre des mesures raisonnables pour protéger les Informations à caractère personnel contre tout usage abusif, perte, accès non autorisé, divulgation, altération et destruction. Subsplash a mis en place des procédures physiques, électroniques et de gestion appropriées pour protéger et sécuriser les informations contre la perte, l’abus et l’accès non autorisé, ou la divulgation, l’altération ou la destruction. Subsplash ne peut pas garantir la sécurité des informations qui se trouvent sur Internet ou qui sont transmises par ce moyen.

**Intégrité des données**

Subsplash ne saurait traiter les Informations à caractère personnel que d’une manière qui est pertinente et compatible aux fins pour lesquelles elles ont été recueillies ou autorisées par les personnes qui ont fourni les informations. Dans la mesure nécessaire à ces fins, Subsplash est tenue de prendre toutes les mesures raisonnables pour s’assurer que les Informations à caractère personnel sont exactes, complètes, actuelles et fiables pour l’usage prévu.

**Accès**

Dans les cas où Subsplash recueille des Informations à caractère personnel directement des personnes concernées, Subsplash permet à celles-ci d’accéder à leurs Informations à caractère personnel et leur permet de corriger, de modifier ou de supprimer des informations inexactes, sauf dans les cas où la charge ou le coût de la fourniture de l’accès serait disproportionné par rapport aux risques pour la protection de la vie privée de la personne concernée dans ledit cas ou lorsque les droits de personnes autres que la personne concernée seraient violés. Comme indiqué ci-dessus, vous ne pouvez pas supprimer toutes les informations si vous souhaitez maintenir un compte avec Subsplash et Subsplash a l’obligation de conserver certaines informations concernant les transactions de Subsplash Giving et des utilisateurs applicables.

**Recours, mise en application et responsabilité**

**a)** Règlement des litiges

Si vous avez déposé une plainte auprès de Subsplash et qu’elle n’a pas été traitée adéquatement, Subsplash  désigne JAMS comme organe indépendant de règlement de différends pour traiter les plaintes concernant la collecte d’Informations à caractère personnel de Subsplash et fournir les recours appropriés. Cet organe ne facture pas ses services à la partie plaignante. Suivez ce [lien](https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim) vers le formulaire de soumission de plainte pour l’organe de règlement de différends mentionné ci-dessus.

**b)** Arbitrage exécutoire

Si vos réclamations concernant les données couvertes par le Privacy Shield UE–États-Unis n’ont pas été résolues par le règlement de différend directement avec Subsplash ou par le biais du règlement de différend indépendant décrit ci-dessus, ces « réclamations résiduelles » peuvent être entendues par un « Panel du Privacy Shield » composé d’un ou de trois arbitres comme convenu entre les parties. Le Panel du Privacy Shield peut uniquement accorder un redressement équitable, non pécuniaire et spécifique selon la personne (par exemple accès aux données, correction, suppression des données en question de la personne) nécessaire pour remédier à la violation des Principes, uniquement en ce qui concerne la personne concernée. Aucun dommage-intérêt, coût, frais et autre recours ne peuvent être octroyés et chaque partie supporte ses propres frais d’avocats. Cette option d’arbitrage n’est disponible que pour une personne physique pour décider de « réclamations résiduelles », que Subsplash ait ou non violé ses obligations en vertu des Principes à l’égard de cette personne et que ladite violation reste entièrement ou partiellement non réglée.

**c)** RGPD (Règlement Général Sur La Protection Des Données)

Le GDPR remplace la Directive 95/46/EC et est en vigueur depuis le 25 mai 2018. La déclaration suivante est prévue comme complément à la discussion qui précède sur le Privacy Shield UE–États-Unis. En ce qui concerne les données à caractère personnel recueillies et contrôlées par Subsplash, sous réserve des limitations et restrictions énoncées dans le débat qui précède, les personnes concernées de l’UE conservent leurs droits entiers d’être informées des fins de nos activités de traitement au moment de la collecte, de retirer leur consentement, de consulter, rectifier, transporter et effacer leurs données à caractère personnel, de s’opposer au traitement pour des efforts de marketing direct et de s’opposer lorsqu’elles font l’objet de décisions fondées sur le traitement automatisé. En ce qui concerne les données à caractère personnel recueillies par des tiers et pour lesquelles Subsplash n’est que le prestataire des services de traitement, les personnes concernées de l’UE doivent contacter le responsable (par exemple une église ou un ministère) en ce qui concerne leurs droits d’être informées des fins de nos activités de traitement au moment de la collecte, de retirer leur consentement, de consulter, rectifier, transporter et effacer leurs données à caractère personnel de s’opposer au traitement pour des efforts de marketing direct et de s’opposer lorsqu’elles font l’objet de décisions fondées sur le traitement automatisé. Ces droits peuvent être assujettis à certaines restrictions et limitations comme indiqué dans le débat sur le Privacy Shield UE–États-Unis. 

Nos agents de traitement des données qui aideront gratuitement les résidents de l’UE avec ces demandes peuvent être joints à l’adresse privacy@subsplash.com.

Subsplash comprend que l’adoption de pratiques de sécurité pour les données au niveau mondial n’est pas une activité ponctuelle. L’approche de protection de la vie privée dès la conception (« privacy bt design ») de Subsplash exige que nos niveaux par défaut de protection des données de l’utilisateur soient automatiquement réglés au niveau le plus élevé. Dans le cas peu probable d’une violation des données, Subsplash en avise les personnes concernées et les autorités de contrôle de l’UE selon les procédures indiquées aux Articles 33 et 34 du GDPR.

Nous ne recueillons pas intentionnellement les données à caractère personnel d’enfants et nous ne personnalisons aucun de nos services à leur intention.

VeraSafe a été désigné comme représentant de Subsplash dans l’Union européenne pour les questions de protection des données, conformément à l’Article 27 du Règlement général sur la protection des données de l’Union européenne. Il est possible de contacter VeraSafe, en plus du responsable de la protection de la vie privée, uniquement pour les questions concernant le traitement des données à caractère personnel.

Toute divulgation que nous faisons ne couvre que la période de douze (12) mois précédant la réception de votre demande.

Pour les demandes de portabilité des données, nous choisissons un format qui soit facilement utilisable pour vos Informations à caractère personnel et qui puisse vous permettre de transmettre les informations d’une entité à une autre sans entrave. 

Nous ne facturons pas de frais pour traiter votre demande vérifiable de personne concernée de Californie ou pour y répondre, à moins qu’elle soit excessive, répétitive ou manifestement infondée. Si nous déterminons que la demande justifie des frais, nous vous indiquons pourquoi nous avons pris cette décision et nous vous fournissons une estimation des coûts avant d’exécuter votre demande. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser de répondre aux demandes vérifiables de personnes concernées de Californie qui sont excessives, répétitives ou manifestement infondées.
