I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge. I have programmed this app to collect personally identifiable information like device id, email and name. Some data (app preferences (like theme, chat history, etc.) and data) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

We don’t collect or store payment data, details or payments-related personal data. Payment processing takes place through a payment system, integrated into the app store. If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
