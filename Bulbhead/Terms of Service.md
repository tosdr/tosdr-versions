Payment can be made by means of Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card, American Express, or PayPal.  Unless otherwise stated, all prices are listed in United States dollars.

Our Guarantee

Thank you for shopping BulbHead.com.  We believe in 100% customer satisfaction.  Therefore, we will accommodate an exchange or refund of your purchase price (excluding discounts and shipping and handling charges).  To conduct such an exchange or receive a refund, items must be returned to BulbHead in their original condition, within 30 days of receiving them.  Refunds are issued using the same method of payment you used for the order.

Products returned in original condition after 30 days of the receipt date will be issued a merchandise credit, equal to the original purchase price (excluding discounts, and shipping and handling charges) and may be used towards a future purchase at BulbHead.com

Return Information

We are confident that the value and quality of our merchandise will meet, if not exceed, your expectations.  If you are not completely satisfied within 30 days of your purchase, we promise a full merchandise refund, credit or exchange (shipping & handling charges are not refundable).

Return labels are available at a cost of $9.99 (deducted from your refund), or you may choose a shipping service.  We suggest a ground method that can be tracked (e.g., UPS ground/FedEx Ground/USPS Priority mail).  To secure a return label, simply visit www.BulbHead.com and log into the “‘My Account” section.  Select “My Orders” and use the “Return Label” link to view and print your return label.

Exceptions to Return Policy

Please do not return Intimate Apparel for a refund due to health and sanitary reasons.  We will replace at no cost, any such item received in a defective state (i.e. ripped, torn, or broken).

Consumable items (products that can be diminished or used up) are not returnable once they are opened.  However, we will accept a return for any unused and unopened consumable item.

DVDs and software products may only be exchanged in the event of a manufacturing defect.

All returns must be in their original packaging along with all accessories, parts, and instruction manuals that were shipped with your original order.  Our 30-day return policy starts from the day your order is received.  The return package must be postmarked within 30 days of the date your order was delivered (regardless of what date the product was first used).

Returns not meeting our return requirements may result in the loss of a refund or replacement.  Such a return also will not be sent back to you.

Refund Policy

Once your return is received at the warehouse, it will be processed within up to 5 business days.  BulbHead will not be responsible for loss or damage of return shipments.  A refund will be issued to your original method of payment for the full purchase price, excluding shipping and handling and any separate fees.  Refunds typically reflect in your account within 3-5 business days of receiving your returned item.

Returns not meeting our return requirements may result the loss of a refund or replacement.  Such a return also will not be sent back to you.

1. **Our Copyright**

You agree not to copy, distribute, display, disseminate, or otherwise reproduce any of the information on the Site without receiving our prior written permission.

1. **Your Copyright**

BulbHead must be assured that it has the right to use the content that is posted to its Site by its Users.  Such content may include, but is not limited to, photographs, videos, text, audio, and other materials.  Whenever submitting content to our Site, you agree that you are granting us a non-exclusive, universal, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, commercial and non-commercial right to use, distribute, sell, publish, and otherwise make use of the content that you submit to us.  You warrant to us that you have the right to grant us this right over the content, and that you will indemnify us for any loss resulting from a breach of this warranty and defend us against claims regarding the same.

1. **Trademarks**

“BulbHead” is a trademark used by us, BulbHead.com, to uniquely identify our Site, Service, and business.  You agree not to use this phrase anywhere without our prior written consent.  Additionally, you agree not to use our trade dress, or copy the look and feel of our Site or its design, without our prior written consent.  You agree that this paragraph goes beyond the governing law on intellectual property law, and includes prohibitions on any competition that violates the provisions of this paragraph, including starting your own competing website or business.

1. **Revocation of Consent**

We may revoke our consent for your use of our intellectual property, or any other permission granted to you under this Agreement, at any time.  You agree that if we so request, you must take immediate action to remove any usage of our intellectual property that you may have engaged in, even if it would cause a loss to you.

1. **Copyright & Trademark Infringement**

We take copyright infringement very seriously, and we have registered a Copyright Agent with the United States Copyright Office, which limits our liability under the _Digital Millennium Copyright Act_.  If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please send us a message which contains:

* Your name.
* The name of the party whose copyright has been infringed, if different from your name.
* The name and description of the work that is being infringed.
* The location on our website of the infringing copy.
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted work described above is not authorized by the copyright owner (or by a third party who is legally entitled to do so on behalf of the copyright owner) and is not otherwise permitted by law.
* A statement that you swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in this notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or have an exclusive right in law to bring infringement proceedings with respect to its use.

You must sign this notification electronically and send it to our Copyright Agent at [info@bulbhead.com](mailto:info@bulbhead.com)

Although U.S. law does not provide for a similar procedure for trademark infringement, we recommend that you send us similar information to that above in regards to any allegation of trademark infringement, and we will address it as soon as practicable.

1. **Communications Decency Act**

Similar to the DMCA provisions above, United States law—specifically Section 230 of the _Communications Decency Act_—creates a defense for us for the actions of third parties in regards to any defamatory content posted on our Site.  Although we are not liable for defamatory words posted on our website by our Users even if given notice, we do prohibit defamation under this Agreement and we may, if we believe the situation warrants it, take action against the offending User.  Please notify us at [info@bulbhead.com](mailto:info@bulbhead.com) if any of our Users have posted anything that you believe is defamatory.

1. **Representations & Warranties**

WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE MERCHANTABILITY OF OUR SERVICE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES, FOR REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF OUR SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER TORT.  TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM EXISTS.

YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY USE OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO COMMIT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, DEFAMATION, TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC RELATIONS, OR ANY OTHER ACTIONABLE CONDUCT TOWARDS YOU.

YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FAILURE ON THE PART OF A PAYMENT PROCESSOR, INCLUDING PAYPAL OR THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY OR BANK THAT YOU USE TO FUND PAYPAL, TO DIRECT PAYMENTS TO THE CORRECT DESTINATION, OR ANY ACTIONS ON THEIR PART IN PLACING A HOLD ON YOUR FUNDS.

YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES OF OUR COMPANY OR A THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS, UNTIMELY DELIVERY, SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED, INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL, ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY.

THE PROVISION OF OUR SERVICE TO YOU IS CONTINGENT ON YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  NOTHING IN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS “REPRESENTATIONS & WARRANTIES” SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE GENERALITY OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION.

**_For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability:_** Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.  Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."  YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE.  YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.

1. **Indemnity**

You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any claims by you or any third party which may arise from or relate to this Agreement or the provision of our service to you, including any damages caused by your use of our Site or acceptance of the offers contained on it.  You also agree that you have a duty to defend us against such claims and we may require you to pay for an attorney(s) of our choice in such cases.  You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements.  In the event of a claim such as one described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making the claim, and you shall be liable for the damages as though we had proceeded with a trial.

1. **Choice of Law**

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the State of New Jersey.  The offer and acceptance of this contract are deemed to have occurred in the State of New Jersey.

1. **Forum of Dispute**

You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New Jersey.  Specifically, where the subject matter of a dispute is eligible for it, you agree that any disputes shall be heard solely within the lowest civil court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New Jersey (“Small Claims Court”).

If a dispute claims multiple claims and one or more of those claims would be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, you agree not to bring the other claims against us and to instead proceed within the Small Claims Court.

If you would be entitled in a dispute to an amount exceeding the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, you agree to waive your right to collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead still bring your claim within the Small Claims Court.

You agree that if a dispute is eligible to be heard in Small Claims Court but you would be entitled to an additional or alternative remedy in a higher court, such as injunctive relief, you will waive your right to that remedy and still bring the dispute within the Small Claims Court.

If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.

You agree that the unsuccessful party in any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be responsible for the reimbursement of the successful party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements.

1. **Force Majeure**

You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, unavailability of payment processors, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.

1. **Severability**

In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.

If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, BulbHead shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.

1. **Non-Waiver**

BulbHead reserves all rights afforded to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law.  Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.

1. **Termination & Cancellation**

We may terminate your access to our Site and Service at our discretion without explanation, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases.  Our liability for refunding you, if you have paid anything to us, will be limited to the amount you paid for goods or services which have not yet been and will not be delivered, except in cases where the termination or cancellation was due to your breach of this Agreement, in which case you agree that we are not required to provide any refund or other compensation whatsoever.

Under no circumstances, including termination or cancellation of our Service to you, will we be liable for any losses related to actions of other Users.

1. **Assignment of Rights**

You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent.  We may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our discretion.

1. **Amendments**

We may amend this Agreement from time to time.  When we amend this Agreement, we will update this page accordingly.  You must read this page each time that you access our Service, and your continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of any such amendments.

1. **California Users and Residents**

Pursuant to _California Civil Code_ Section 1789.3, any questions about pricing, complaints, or inquiries about BulbHead must be addressed to our agent for notice and sent via certified mail to that agent.  For our agent’s most current contact information, please send a request to [info@bulbhead.com](mailto:info@bulbhead.com)

Lastly, California users are also entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.
