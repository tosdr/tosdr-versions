15.2. The contract continues until it is ended in accordance with this clause 15.

15.3. You may at any time, and without notice, terminate this contract by requesting us to delete your account with us. You can do this within your profile settings.

We retain your chats with our fictitious profiles or other users for a reasonable period, but these will not be available to other users.) We will not send you a reminder that we are about to delete your account or put it beyond use. We will retain some of your personnel data (including chats with other users) for certain purposes, as set out in our privacy policy.

16.1. We are not responsible for losses you suffer caused by us breaking this contract if the loss is:

(a) Unexpected, i.e. it was not obvious that it would happen and nothing you said to us before we accepted your order meant we should have expected it (so, in law, the loss was unforeseeable).

(b) Caused by a delaying event outside our control, provided we have taken the steps set out in clause 17. We are not responsible for events outside our control.

(c) Avoidable. Something you could have avoided by taking reasonable action. For example, damage to your own digital content or device, which was caused by digital content we supplied and which you could have avoided by following our advice to apply a free update or by correctly following the installation instructions or having the minimum system requirements advised by us.

(d) A business loss, i.e. it relates to your use of the Website or the Services for the purposes of your trade, business, craft or profession.

16.2. Non compliance with content standard. We are not responsible for losses you suffer arising from your use of the Services in contravention of our content standards set out in clause 6.

16.3. The limitations of liability apply collectively to our affiliated companies, directors, employees, representatives and legal successors, who may at all times rely upon the provisions of this article for their own benefit.

  

**17\. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL**

17.1. If the provision of Services is prevented by an event outside our control, we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and do what we can to reduce the delay. This will be normally via a pop up message on the Website, although we may contact you in another way. As long as we do this, we will not compensate you for the time the Services were not available, but if the delay is likely to be substantial you can contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for in advance, but not received.

  

**18\. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THE WEBSITE AND THE SERVICES**

18.1. Changes we can always make. We can always change these terms and conditions, the Website and/or the Services:

(a) to reflect any changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements;

(b) to make minor technical adjustments and improvements, for example, to address a security threat. These are changes that will not affect your use of the Website or Services; or

(c) to update digital content, provided that the digital content always matches the description of it that we provided to you before you bought it.

18.2. Changes we can only make if we give you notice and an option to terminate. We can also make other types of change to these terms and conditions, the Website and/or the Services, but if we plan to do so we will notify you and you can then contact us to end the contract before the change takes effect and receive a refund for Services you have paid for in advance, but not received.

  

**19\. HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US**
