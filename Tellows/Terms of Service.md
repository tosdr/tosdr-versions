1\. About tellows
-----------------

Dear tellows user, We are happy that you use tellows to identify unknown phone numbers. Our goal is the best possible protection against unwanted calls. With your reviews and experience reports on phone numbers, you are the most important part of the community! Because of you, other users receive helpful information about unknown numbers and can be warned in time.

By now, tellows is more than just a forum for the reverse search of phone numbers. By integrating our tellows scorelists and app solutions, tellows users are warned of suspicious phone numbers around the world. tellows offers many advantages and makes spam control as easy as possible:

* All collected information is available to you at any time, whether on the desktop, mobile or via app
* All phone number information is generated by users and based on personal experience reports
* tellows has developed a score to rank phone numbers on a scale of 1 (trustworthy) to 9 (untrustworthy)
* Rating criterias provide specific information about the caller (e.g. caller name)
* Suspected score manipulation or self-evaluation will be checked as soon as possible
* Comments from registered users are protected from deletion by other users
* Take advantage of spam protection from our apps, the tellows lists or partner applications for your phone system

2\. General Information About the Forum Usage
---------------------------------------------

With tellows, we offer you a platform where you can exchange information about phone numbers with other users. To provide helpful comments to other users, you should consider the following guidelines:  
  

1\. Use the Login to Protect Your Comment more ▼

Only admin members can change or remove comments from registered users. Prior to a removal, we will contact you. Therefore, please use a valid email address.

2\. Select a Precise Caller Name more ▼

Phone numbers containing the same caller name are linked. A specific caller name is more helpful to other users. The use of sentences or general descriptions are not conclusive. If you are not sure about the caller name, you can leave the field empty.  
**Example**  

did not understand, hung up or annoying guy

Better

TPS customer service, John Smith or debt collector

3\. Frame Your Opinion Subjectively more ▼

A factual claim is not always verifiable and has to be removed in case of doubt.  
**Example**  

Those scammers call me daily. Very untrustworthy.

Better

I suppose the caller wants to sell me a subscription. I disapprove of this method.

4\. Make Objective Statements Without Offending Content more ▼

Even if the call was negative, please consider the netiquette and don't take it out on the forum.  
**Example**  

Those idiots call me all day. F\*cking lowlives.

Better

I'm extremely bugged by those advertising calls.

5\. Don't Publish Personal Data more ▼

This includes full names of private people, addresses, email addresses or bank account numbers. Those comments will be removed immediately due to the data protection law.  
**Example**  

John Smith from Bideford! He sold me an article, but never sent the goods. He has my money now and is not reachable. Here are his bank details: WSXXDE38, DE64BOFI90583XX2345678. If anyone knows anything, please contact me [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellows.co.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Better

John S. from B. He never delivered my articles. If anyone knows anything, contact me.

6\. Use Important Information in Your Comment more ▼

The more details you post, the more helpful your comment will be for others. The most important details are the caller information (name, company), the time of the call, the amount of calls and the supposed reason of the call. A precise description of the call provides further helpful details. Try to keep an objective view.  
**Example**  

I have been called on Wednesday at lunch time. I did not understand the name, but I suppose it is company X. The caller asked me some questions. I suppose he wanted me to say "yes" in order to finish a contract. I declined and asked him to remove my name from the caller list. I experienced the call as very annoying. The number called me multiple times later that day.

3\. Terms Of Use tellows Forum
------------------------------

tellows offers a variety of products and services, including web pages, applications and APIs. The terms of use govern the access and use of our products and services. When accessing and using our products and services, the user agrees to our terms and the [Privacy Policy](https://www.tellows.co.uk/c/about-tellows-uk/privacy-policy/). With the use of the forum, the user declares his consent to data storage and these summarized rules of the forum.

1. Registration
No registration is required to participate in the tellows forum. Comments can be submitted as a registered or unregistered user. An OpenID service can be used to register. Thereby, an existing account of another service (e.g. Google) is linked to the tellows website through an authentication system. No separate account is created on the tellows website. Linking an account through OpenID enables [additional options](http://blog.tellows.co.uk/de/2016/01/comment-feature-advantage-as-registered-tellows-user/) for comments and account settings on tellows. OpenID users are registered with the e-mail address of the linked account. The e-mail address must always be accessible to the user in order to be contacted for possible queries on the part of tellows. The use of an invalid e-mail address is not permitted.3. No legal advice
According to the current legal status, concrete legal advice is prohibited without special official permission – which is essentially only given to lawyers – and can be penalized with fines up to 5,000 euros. This prohibition also applies to contributions to the forum of tellows. For this reason, please pay attention to the discussion of abstract legal questions or other legal issues. Contributions, which in our opinion have a legal advisory content, are deleted as well as the related questions without further questions.4. Prohibited content
It is forbidden to post content of the following kind in the forum: insults, untruthful claims, abusive criticism, boycott calls of any kind, bank account numbers, private notices and telephone numbers, links on pages with illegal or legally questionable content, commercial advertising. Contents of discriminatory, xenophobic, racist, pornographic or otherwise unlawful nature are just as inadmissible as harassing, defamatory or threatening contents. Corresponding contributions are also removed without further inquiry.  
Manipulations of the tellows score are prohibited. Before submitting a comment, the legitimate interest is requested. A comment can be posted if the user has been called by this number or wants to publish a statement. Duplicated comments without reference to the number, as well as comment publications by the same user, that acts under different user accounts or user names, are not allowed.6. Create company entries
The comment function should not be used to publish business data. Therefore, we recommend to create a company entry. You can create an entry for any number that does not yet have negative ratings. Every company entry must contain information about the company name, address and the branch. Further details are possible.  
To create or change an entry, click on the edit button (pencil symbol) behind the address on the respective number detail page. Company entries that have not yet been confirmed can be changed at any time. In the event of incorrect information that cannot be changed by yourself, please [contact us](https://www.tellows.co.uk/c/about-tellows-uk/support-en/). Contact the support team of the respective partner for change inquiries about entries that have been made by our partners. Please note that we can delete entries from partners, but they can be added again if the entry still exists in the partner's database. It is therefore recommended to contact the partner directly.9. Virtual house law and house ban
If users of the forum do not abide by the rules just mentioned, tellows can make use of its “virtual house law” and prohibit the user from continuing to use the forum after a single warning.10. Deletion of contributions
tellows expressly reserves the right to delete contributions without special reasons. A claim to maintain a contribution in the forum is not guaranteed. However, we will usually delete contributions only if this could result in a liability of tellows as a forum operator.  
There is no claim for deletion of the entries. If the content of a contribution allows a clear personal reference to the author, however, the deletion or anonymisation of the respective contribution may be required.  
Comments written by unregistered users can be removed by any user. By clicking on the grey spam button to the right of the comment, a deletion with justification can be initiated. In order to remove comments made by registered users, we need a removal explanation via our [contact form](https://www.tellows.co.uk/c/about-tellows-uk/support-en/).14. Data processing and data protection
Besides the data specified in the privacy policy, the following data will be stored in the forum: The forum software stores so-called cookies on your computer. The data stored there improves the usability of the forum, e.g. by displaying the correct language. More information about the [privacy policy](http://tellows.de/c/about-tellows-uk/privacy-policy/) on tellows.16. Liability for contributions
Many contributions to this forum contain expressions of opinion as well as further references. tellows does not explicitly adopt the content of individual third-party contributions, unless a special response to the individual contribution reveals anything else.
