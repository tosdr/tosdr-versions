Privacy Policy
==============

INTRODUCTION
------------

Exposure Labs is a film and impact production company. We believe in the transformative power of storytelling to change our world. Our work includes the production of original documentary films, the development of impact campaigns to support these films, and field-building efforts to support other storytellers and movement-builders in using film as a more effective tool for action and advocacy.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is intended to inform you about the data processing we undertake through the Exposure Labs and Exposure Labs’ productions websites, including The Social Dilemma, Chasing Ice and Chasing Coral.

This policy does not address our other personal data processing operations. Additional policies and procedures are in place to address those operations and we provide relevant information to data subjects and the point of data collection, or as required by law.

This Policy is subject to regular review. Subsequent updates and amendments will be documented below and communicated to data subjects where required.

DATA CONTROLLER
---------------

The data controller for data collected and processed in accordance with this Policy is Exposure Labs:

P.O. Box 18930

Boulder, CO 80308

Any questions regarding this Policy or any other data protection issue should be submitted via email to privacy@exposurelabs.com

WHAT WE PROCESS & WHY
---------------------

### WEBSITE

We use cookies on our website – these include essential and non-essential cookies. Any non-essential cookies are dropped on the basis of your consent. More information about the cookies we use is provided in the Cookie section below.  

### MAILING LIST & EMAILS

We send out newsletters to keep our network informed of our work and productions. On the basis of your consent, we collect your name and email address from you for this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the mailing list through the link provided in our newsletters.

On the basis of our legitimate interest, we may also share your name and email with our email provider in order to send you communications about events you sign up to, if you make a donation to us, or where you engage with us, for example by making a pledge or offering to host a screening. You can opt-out of these emails at any time by unsubscribing through the link provided.

### EVENTS

We organise events from time to time, using SplashThat and other trusted platforms to manage RSVPs and ticketing. When you sign up for one of our events, we will direct you to the platform where, on the basis of your consent, we will collect your name and email address in order to issue you with a ticket.

### OUTREACH

For those looking to screen one of our films or host an event in conjunction with our impact campaigns, we collect names, contact and event details on the basis of consent. We use Gravity Forms to collect this information and to register these events.

If you sign up to our Environmental Voter Project, we collect your name, email, street address and phone number on the basis of your consent. We partner with the Environmental Voter Project (EVP) to collect this information. EVP updates us on new users who have taken this pledge, this is purely for impact analysis purposes and does not include any personally identifiable information.

### FUNDRAISING

To collect and manage donations, we partner with the Wild Foundation for Chasing Coral and the Denver Film Society for The Social Dilemma. If you make a donation you will be directed to the partner’s website and your name, contact details and payment information will be processed on the basis of your consent. Your information will be processed in accordance with our partners’ privacy policies, which are available here: [Wild Foundation Privacy Policy](https://www.wild.org/privacy-policy/), [Denver Film Society Privacy Policy](https://www.denverfilm.org/privacy-policy/). 

### ADVERTISING

We occasionally advertise through social media platforms like Facebook, but we do not use any information about individuals to target them.

### DATA RETENTION

In general, data will be retained for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. Where data is collected on the basis of consent, we retain it until you withdraw your consent or otherwise when the data becomes no longer relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. Some data is retained in line with legal obligations on us, for example tax record keeping connected with making a donation, and it will be deleted at the end of the relevant period required by law.

### SENSITIVE DATA

Exposure Labs does not collect any sensitive data within the definition of EU data protection laws. As described above, we partner with EVP and collect data that indicates an individual prioritises the environment when voting, but this data only relates to US-based individuals and does not reveal political affiliations or opinions.
