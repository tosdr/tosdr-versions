How does this Privacy Policy define “personal information”?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The term “personal information” as used throughout this policy, applies to any data relating to an identified or identifiable individual, including data that identifies an individual or that could be used to identify, locate, contact or track behavior or preferences of an individual.

How do we collect personal information online?
----------------------------------------------

We collect personal information online through web sites and other online resources. We also offer online resources in collaboration with other online service providers, from which we may receive personal information about users of such resources. These online collaborations are governed by agreements that require personal information to be protected appropriately. Individuals may access many parts of our web sites and online resources without disclosing any personal information. There are three methods that we use to collect personal information online:

1. **Information that you provide:** We collect personal information and other data that you may enter into forms or data fields on our web sites or online resources. Such information may include, but not be limited to, contact information (such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, user ID and password), date of birth, professional credentials, experiences, activities, skills, preferences, hobbies and interests. We may also collect, when relevant for the processing purpose, health information about you that you provide by responding to our questions and surveys or through your use of online and downloadable health-related tools we provide. Some of our web sites enable users to place orders, such as for our vaccines and animal health products. These web sites may use external accredited third parties (i.e., on-line credit card checking managed by financial or credit organizations) or directly collect credit card information to process those orders. Such information will be secured appropriately and not kept longer than necessary for providing the service.
2. **Information from public or third-party information sources:** We may collect personal information about health care professionals who register on our web sites from public or third party information sources to verify their professional credentials and identity. When customers use a credit card to place an order on our web sites, we verify the validity of the credit card information with financial or credit organizations. In some cases, we may augment our existing user databases with information from third parties. Some of this information may be personal information, such as change of postal address information.
    
    We may also collect personal information about you from public Internet source via what is known as social media listening. Examples of social media include social networking; communities, forums, and message boards; blogging, microblogging, and vlogging; wikis; social bookmarking; and podcasts.
    
3. **Information collected from your computer or other electronic device:** We collect information about your computer or other electronic device when you visit our web sites and use our online resources. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet Service Provider (ISP), domain name, browser type, date and time of your request and information provided by tracking technologies, such as cookies, single-pixel tags, local share objects (Flash), local storage, Etags and scripts. In the United States, if you leave one of our web sites without becoming a registered user we may use cookies in conjunction with third parties to serve advertisements to your computer or other electronic device to remind you about our web site that you had previously visited. Please see [Global Online Tracking Policy](https://www.msdprivacy.com/us/en//cookie-privacy-policy/) for more information about cookies and how you can control them. If you use a mobile device to access our web sites and online resources or to download our mobile apps or services, we also may collect information about your device, such as your device ID and device type, as well as usage information about your device and your use of our mobile web sites and other mobile resources.
    
    We may use other companies to deliver e-mail communications on our behalf or to place our advertisements on other web sites. Please review the privacy policies of these third parties to familiarize yourself with their practices. For more information about how you can control tracking by third parties, please see our [Global Online Tracking Policy](https://www.msdprivacy.com/us/en//cookie-privacy-policy/)
    

Why do we collect, use and disclose personal information?
---------------------------------------------------------

1. **Generally**: We collect personal information online as necessary to enable individuals to register for, customize and personalize certain of our online resources and communications. We use personal information collected online to provide products, services and features and other resources that individuals have requested; for example, educational literature and related information about our business, e-mail programs, tools, quizzes, questionnaires, and surveys. We analyze personal information collected online to identify and offer additional services and promotions that we believe you might find interesting. We evaluate use of some online resources and communications with non-identifiable or aggregate information only. We also may use personal information to audit our online resources for compliance, authorized access and security.
2. **Social Media**: Online social media resources are interactive tools that typically enable you to collaborate and share information with others. Some examples of social media resources include social networks, discussion boards, bulletin boards, blogs, wikis, and referral functions to share web site content and tools with a friend or colleague. We may collect personal information from you to enable you to use online social media resources we may offer from time to time. We may also enable you to use these social media resources to post or share personal information with others. You should consider carefully what information about yourself and others such as colleagues, friends, customers or patients, you choose to share with others when you use social media resources. We provide additional notice and choices about how personal information is collected, used and disclosed on our web sites and other online resources that offer or utilize social media.
    
    Some of our web sites use sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide the option for you to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate registration and other sign-up forms. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information to your Facebook profile page about your activities on our sites that use this service so that you can share your activities with others in your network.
    
    Social media listening is the process by which we identify and assess what is being said about a company, individual, product or brand on the Internet. We will only collect relevant, adequate and not excessive publicly available personal information. Because of the nature of Social Media, it may not be possible for us to identify the individual who posted the original content that we collect. If personal information is collected and will be processed beyond the original intent when you posted the content, reasonable efforts will be made to provide notice to you as soon as is practical. Note, in some cases it may not be possible to collect and verify your contact details given the available information. Reasonable efforts might entail identifying your contact details from the social media platform, if possible, or within the posting. Moreover, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you with a mechanism by which to opt-out of our data processing or exercise your rights as required by our policy and applicable regulations.
    
    We also collect personal information from the public domain for adverse event reporting purposes to fulfill our pharmacovigilance compliance requirements. The basis for this type of collection of personal information is a requirement to satisfy a legal obligation. In these circumstances, no consent from you is required, but we will provide you with notice as part of our pharmacovigilance policies and procedures.
    
3. **Mobile Computing**: Some of our web sites and online resources are designed specifically for use on mobile computing devices. Some mobile versions of our web sites may require that you log in with your user account for that web site. Information about your use of the mobile version of the web site will be associated with your user account. Some of our web sites and online resources enable you to download an application (app), widget or other tool that you can use on your mobile or other computing device. Some of these apps may store information on your mobile or other device. These apps may transmit personal information to us, or others working for us, to enable you to access your user account or to enable us to track how these tools are used, such as how often they are used and which features are preferred. Some of these apps may enable you to e-mail reports and other information from the app. We may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to us to enhance these apps, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Policy or in other notices we provide. These applications usually do not transmit personal information other than as described above nor sensitive personal information. In case such transfers are required to deliver the services requested by you in the application, we will provide notice and choice to allow such processing in addition to all relevant rights for access, correction and deletion as required by this policy and applicable laws.
    

Do we consolidate personal information?
---------------------------------------

Consistent with the purposes identified and standards set within this policy and other applicable privacy notices that have been provided, in some cases we consolidate and use personal information that individuals share with us through various services and channels, such as the telephone, surveys, web sites and other online resources and communications, in order to enhance the quality of services that we offer. Potential data consolidation activities extend across the different data subject categories for which this policy applies. This includes employees, contractors, Healthcare Professional, patients, or vendors.

What choices do you have about how we collect, use and disclose personal information about you?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can limit the use of personal information about you by checking or un-checking options provided at the time that you enter that information or that we may offer to you in the future.
