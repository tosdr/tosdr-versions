TL;DR

Eat This Much collects some Personal Data from its Users, as will be explained more fully in this Privacy Policy. We have some analytics packages installed to help us determine usage of our Sites, plus some basic Facebook and Twitter integration. If you use our restaurant meal finder (web only for now), we may also ask for location permissions (or you can enter any location manually). Sometimes we also use remarketing to ask Google and/or Facebook to show you an ad about our service. If you rate foods and recipes on our service, we do some processing to suggest recipes we think you'll like, based on recipes that other people liked. This data is not shared with anyone else.

Mode and place of processing of Personal Data
---------------------------------------------

### Purpose of processing

We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Personal Data. The Personal Data concerning the User is collected to allow us to provide our Services, as well as for the following purposes: Analytics, Interaction with external social networks and platforms, Access to third-party accounts, Remarketing and behavioral targeting, Tag Management, Managing support and contact requests, Interaction with support and feedback platforms, Infrastructure monitoring, Traffic optimization and distribution, Handling payments, Managing contacts and sending messages, Contacting the User and Handling activity data.

### Methods of processing

The Personal Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.

### Legal basis of processing

We may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:

* Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
* provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
* processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
* processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
* processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

### Geographic Location of Data Storage and Processing

The Sites collect information and process and store that information in databases located in the United States and Canada. If you are visiting the Sites from a country outside the United States, you should be aware that you may transfer personally identifiable information about yourself to the United States, and that the data protection laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.

By visiting the Sites and submitting any personally identifiable information you consent to the transfer of such personally identifiable information to the United States.

### Retention time

Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.

Therefore:

* Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between us and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
* Personal Data collected for the purposes of our legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by us within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting us.

We may retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority. Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

**YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NOT BE SOLD.** Nor will Your Personal Data be licensed or disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties, except in connection with the sale, transfer, merger, consolidation or other transaction involving all or part of our company or as may be permitted under applicable law.

We do not sell your information to third parties for marketing purposes, and we restrict such third parties’ usage of your information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that no security safeguards or method of transmission over the Internet are completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Sites.

The rights of Users
-------------------

Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.

In particular, Users have the right to do the following:

* Withdraw their consent at any time. Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.
* Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are provided in the dedicated section below.
* Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.
* Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.

Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification.

### How to exercise these rights

Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.

California Consumers
--------------------

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other California privacy laws provides California residents (i.e., consumers) with specific rights regarding personal information.

### _Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights_

California residents have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm a verifiable consumer request from you, we will disclose to you, to the extent permitted by law:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
* The categories of sources for your personal information we collected about you.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information.
* The categories of third parties with whom we share your personal information.
* If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

You shall have the right to request that the information described above be provided to you in a portable and readily usable format, to the extent technically feasible (“data portability”).

### _Deletion Request Rights_

You have the right to request that we delete certain of your personal information that we collected from and/or related to you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

To the extent that we can delete your personal information, once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:

* Complete the transaction for which we collected your personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, or take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you.
* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
* Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
* Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
* Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
* Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
* Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

### _Exercising Your Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.eatthismuch.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with your personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. Any disclosures provided pursuant to the CCPA will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request.

We will respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt, or notify you that we require more time to respond and the reason for the extended response time. We will deliver the written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

To the extent that your verifiable consumer request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, we may charge a reasonable fee to respond to such a request.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Further, EU Users have certain data rights with respect to our handling of your Personal Data.

#### Explanation and copies of your data

You have the right to request an explanation of the personal data that we have about you and how we use that data.

You also have the right to receive a copy of the Personal Data that we collect about you if collected on the basis of consent or because we require the information to provide the services that you request.

#### Correction

If we have Personal Data about you that you believe is inaccurate, you have the right to request correction of your Personal Data.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with your Personal Data if We cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Making a data rights request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Data provided in a data request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
