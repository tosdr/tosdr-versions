Terms of Service... Because legal
=================================

### Implicit agreement

We consider it a digital acceptance when you or your affiliates access or in any way use the Simplero service or website. You are implicitly agreeing to these terms as they appear at any time - even if you don’t read them. So we suggest you take a peek. Failure to comply will result in the immediate termination of services, so do yourself a favor and just have a glance.

We may change these terms at any time. If we make major changes we'll let you know by email. By continuing to use Simplero, you will have agreed to these changes.

If you have affiliates promoting for you, they will be bound by these terms as well, and you're responsible for your affiliates adhering to them so have them take a glance too.

### Things you're absolutely positively not allowed to do

Let's clear this out of the way first. If you're even thinking of doing any of these things, we don't want you here!

You must use the website for lawful purposes only. You must not use the website for any of the following:

* Send spam messages via email, text messages or any other medium.
* Violate any laws, statutes, ordinances, or regulations in the USA or your own country.
* Sell things or promote content that is illegal, offensive, abusive, indecent, harmful, defamatory, obscene or menacing, abusive, threatening, objectionable, invasive of privacy, in breach of confidence, infringing of intellectual property rights, or is a threat to our or your customers' safety.
* To reproduce, duplicate, copy or resell any part of our website or the content therein because it belongs to us. More on our intellectual property rights below.
* Violate the privacy of the people handing over their information to you – because they trust you to keep it safe.
* Use this website if you are under age 13 or to impersonate any third party or otherwise mislead as to the origin of your content. Be and act maturely please. And no bogus e-mails either.
* To send, use or re-use any material that consists of or contains software viruses or any other harmful or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of Simplero.
* To cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety - because that’s just not the kind of environment we offer here and those kinds of things are not welcome.

Also, it’s fairly obvious, but you must not use our website in any way that causes or is likely to cause the website or access to it to be interrupted, damaged or impaired in any way.

### Acceptable use

You must have proof that all the people in your database have opted in and asked to receive information from you. No buying or selling or renting or bartering information about people.

You must have a published privacy policy that you enforce and live up to, and which is at least as protective of your customers' and leads' personal information as ours, and as the law requires. There can be no selling, loaning or otherwise sharing personal information with third parties.

You understand that you are solely responsible for all content sent from your computer to Simplero so keep an eye out for anything that looks suspicious before you enter it.

If we think what you're doing is spammy or inappropriate, including if someone's doing it on your behalf, we reserve the right to terminate your account without warning or recourse. We really hate spammers. Don't be one.

To comply with the US CAN-SPAM law, all e-mail messages will automatically have an opt-out link. Make sure you don't do anything to obscure it. Also, it must have your physical address, so make sure you enter that correctly in the interface. Make sure you get less than 0.1% spam reports on your campaigns, otherwise we'll have to have a talk, and we may have to suspend your account. If you use your account to send outright spam, we will suspend your account and charge all associated costs to the card on file, as well as help get you prosecuted. But we trust you're not a spammer.

If we get complaints from your customers or third-parties about your behavior, we will notify you via email, and then start to investigate the complaint. We reserve the right to charge you $250 per instance to investigate. If the complaint looks valid, we may have to suspend your account permanently or until we get a good explanation from you.

We reserve the right to restrict or deny service to customers who exploits our liberal pricing of the email delivery, text message delivery, content delivery, video and audio encoding, and other such features that incur extra costs for us.

### Intellectual property rights

We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you upload to and/or market via Simplero. It's yours, unless you are a guest blogger and then you agree to our additional terms specifically for guest blogging.

All the leads and customer information you collect is protected and held in confidence. We do not contact your customers or leads, and we don't sell or share that information with third-parties either, except for the data processing vendors mentioned below.

The same goes for affiliate information. That also is confidential, and is only used to calculate the commission fee and complying with any regulations necessary.

However, the content, layout, design, data, databases and graphics related to Simplero and this website are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws. Content is solely owned by us, unless otherwise indicated.The trademarks and logos which are displayed on the website are trademarks belonging to us. Any use including framing, meta tags or other text utilizing these trademarks, or other trademarks displayed, is strictly prohibited without our express written consent.

If we grant you permission to translate website text owned by Simplero into a language other than English, you agree and understand that you may only translate the text into a language that we have approved in advance, and you are to conduct the translation using the login information that we provide to you to access our third-party translation provider's web application. You also agree that while we may grant you the privilege of translating the website text, you are doing so voluntarily, without the expectation of any current or future compensation, and you recognize that you are not being granted or receiving any intellectual property rights or ownership in the translated language. All original and translated website text is owned by Simplero, and Simplero retains all copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights.

You may not use this site or the materials available on or through this website in a manner that constitutes an infringement of our rights or that has not been authorized by us. You may not in any way use, copy, adapt or represent any of our material in any way as if it is yours or created by you. However, you may use it for your business use, since that is likely why you have purchased it, so long as you give us full credit and attribution.

We hate to be tough about this, but you must understand and acknowledge that Simplero has been developed or obtained by us through the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that this information is a valuable, special and unique asset of ours which needs to be protected from improper and unauthorized use. You would want the same for your website and materials, right?

### License agreement

We offer a software as a service, and this is the license under which you use that software. We own the software and code and all the rights to it, and we reserve the right to revoke the license at any time.

For the avoidance of doubt, all content obtained through us is our property, and you are granted a revocable, non-transferable license, limited to you only.

When you enroll in Simplero, you expressly agree that you will not steal our content. Duplication, sharing, or uploading course files to sharing sites, or downloading or sharing information contrary to the limited license we have provided to you here. This is considered stealing and theft, and while we certainly hope we don’t ever have to be put in this position, we do reserve our right to prosecute theft to the full extent of the law. To make it easier on all of us, just don’t steal our stuff please.

By uploading and/or marketing any material through Simplero, you are granting us a license to use and display your materials, and in so doing, you agree that we are not violating any of your copyright, trademark, or intellectual property rights under any relevant jurisdiction, and you grant us the right to identify you as the author of any of your postings as well. You represent that you either own or have the appropriate legal rights to upload all of the information that you post or upload, and that you are not violating the intellectual property rights of any other person by so doing.

You acknowledge that we have the right but not the obligation to use and display any postings or contributions of any kind and that we may elect to cease the use and display of any such materials (or any portion thereof), at any time for any reason whatsoever. 

You own the data that you enter into Simplero, including your customer information. We do our best to ensure it is backed up at least nightly, but can assume no liability should the backups fail.

All rights not expressly granted in these terms or any express written license, are reserved by us.

### Guest bloggers

If you are selected as a guest blogger for Simplero, you are agreeing to these additional terms:

You retain the copyright to your original work that you submit to Simplero, and if published by Simplero, you are granting Simplero a perpetual, royalty-free license to share your content online on our website, in e-newsletters, in e-books, on social media, and anywhere else we deem appropriate, knowing we agree to give full attribution and credit to you as the author

You agree to not post any of your work that is published by Simplero anywhere else online, including your own website. You can post a different article about the same subject, of course, but the wording may not be identical to the work that is published by Simplero. We desire unique articles that are not posted anywhere else.

You agree not to use the original work that is published by Simplero in any way offline or behind a paywall where Google and other spiders can't get to it.

No compensation will be provided to you as a guest blogger. Your submission is a gift to educate others through Simplero.

### Billing policy

We charge for Simplero in advance: monthly plans every 30 days and annual plans every 360 days. Simplero pricing is always in US Dollars. 

Any fees you accumulate from sending text messages are charged every 30 days for the preceding 30 days. If you exceed plan limits for contacts or approach plan limits for storage, we will automatically provision more contacts or storage for you and charge you a prorated upgrade fee right away.

New accounts may start with a free or lower-cost trial period. At the end of the trial period, we will charge your credit card on file for the next 30-day, 360-day, or other period as agreed up-front, according to the plan shown on your account billing page. We will send you an email at least seven days before the end of your trial period to remind you. You can change your plan any time before the end of your trial on your account billing page. You can cancel your account at any time using the "Delete my Simplero account" link at the bottom of the account billing page.

To access the account billing page, login at simplero.com. If you have more than one Simplero account, make sure you're accessing the one you want to change. Click "Settings" in the main menu, and click "Plan & billing".

If you are not satisfied with the service, we are happy to provide a full refund within 30 days of the end of your first payment. After that, we don't do refunds, and you're paying for availability, so even if you don't use the service, you still have to pay us.

Make sure the credit card and contact information for your account is always up-to-date. That's your responsibility.

All charges are automatically invoiced and charged to the card on file. You'll get an email invoice when that happens.

If we repeatedly cannot charge the outstanding amount, we will first suspend your account and then permanently delete it.

You can close your account any time you'd like. Just go to Settings > Plan and Billing in your admin interface, and you'll find the link at the bottom. 

We reserve the right to adjust prices for use of Simplero as needed. Only one affiliate offer can be applied per account. We charge taxes as applicable.

Just so you know, we are not responsible for any website outside this website. It is your responsibility to review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those websites. So in order to use PayPal, you need to comply with their Acceptable Use Policy. Likewise for other payment gateways you must adhere to their rules and terms. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or any other aspect of their products and services.
