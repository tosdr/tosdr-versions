Privacy Policy...for top secret stuff
=====================================

We keep all customer information confidential. By you providing your personal information to us, you grant us permission to use and store such information. We, in turn, will use our best efforts to keep such information safe and secure. Not surprisingly, your information is stored through our data management system. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage that information and by using Simplero you are granting us that right.

We don't sell or share that information with anyone, other than trusted third-party data processing vendors who process those data on our behalf, and also promise to keep it confidential. We only collect the information we do in order to provide the service and so we can contact you about changes to that service.

We may send marketing messages to you if you have okayed that. You can always opt-out of that okay.

We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that it is necessary to (a) comply with legal process served on us, our partners, sponsors, investors, or affiliates; (b) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our customers; or (c) to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Otherwise, we try our best to keep your information safe and secure.

To use Simplero, you will be given a username (Simplero ID) and password. Keep that info confidential because you are responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. Please tell us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. Help keep Simplero safe. You may also enable two-factor authentication for your Simplero ID, which increases security significantly.

Note that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online, such as on blogs, message boards, emails, or in chat areas, the information you share also can be seen, collected and used by third parties, and therefore, we cannot be responsible for any use of the information that you voluntarily share. Same goes with your password. Don’t share it with others.

Our product is not designed to store sensitive information about people, though we cannot prevent people from entering such information themselves, nor can we prevent our customers from collecting such information. We assume no liability in the case that sensitive personal information are stored in our system without our written consent.

### Data being processed and your rights

We process basic data such as name, email, phone number, and other similar non-sensitive information given to us by people themselves, or given to us by our customers, who certify that they've gotten that information legitimately.

We also store incidental information, such as IP addresses and clicks on links in emails or, in some cases, visits to websites.

We are processing this data in order to send you emails or text messages that you have requested, and to make offers for products that you are likely to be interested in.

You may of course at any point request that we stop sending you more information, or that we delete the information that we have on you.

We are storing that information in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, as well as sharing it with SendGrid for sending emails, and Twilio for sending text messages.

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your PII. You are not required to provide any personal data. 

Your information may in some cases end up with Sentry, which we use for tracking errors on the platform.

You have a right to access your personal data.

At any point you may ask us to delete your information.

### GDPR stuff

We keep our data records until they're explicitly deleted, either because someone asked us to be forgotten, or because a Simplero account was closed.

We store them in a database running behind several layers of security.

In the event that we discover a data breach, we will promptly communicate about it on [status.simplero.com](http://status.simplero.com/).
