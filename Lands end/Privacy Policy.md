### How Your Personal Information Is Protected

**Security Methods**

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry-standard methods to protect that information, and we are CPI complaint. However, no e-commerce solution, website, mobile application, database, or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

**Children’s Personal Information**

We recognize the importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. Lands’ End does not sell products for purchase by children, and all children’s products we sell are for purchase by adults only. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13. If a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information online, we ask that a parent or guardian call Customer Service at 1-800-963-4816. We do not have actual knowledge about selling or sharing personal information of consumers under the age of 16.

**Notice of Financial Incentive**

We may offer financial incentives and/or price or service differences (“Incentives”) to participants in exchange for our use of your personal information.

To offer these Incentives, we must track the personal information you provide when you sign up or engage in activities in connection with our promotions, such as your email address and engagement with Lands’ End (“Lands’ End Data”).

The value of Lands’ End Data is calculated by determining the approximate additional spending per participant, per year compared to individuals who have not participated. The value of Lands’ End Data is reasonably related to the costs associated with offering the Incentives. You can join our mailing list and/or texting list on our Site, and you can withdraw from or cancel your registration at any time by removing yourself from mailing list and/or texting list on our Site or contact us at 1-800-746-3467.

**Retention Period**

We will retain your personal data for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purposes for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (a) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with our Customers and provide services, (b) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, and (c) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

Your California and Other State Privacy Rights
----------------------------------------------

If you are a resident of California or Virginia (starting Jan. 1, 2023), Colorado or Connecticut (starting July 1, 2023), or Utah (starting Dec. 31, 2023), the law in those states provides you with the following rights with respect to your personal information:

* The right to correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing.
* The right to request that we delete any personal information that we have about you.
* The right to opt out of the selling or sharing of your personal information, which you can exercise through the [contact form](https://www.landsend.com/customer-privacy) available on our Site or by modifying your privacy preferences (e.g., Global Privacy Control), available through certain internet browsers and extensions, that signal your preference to opt out. Please note that clearing your cookies at any time will remove the signal of your selected privacy preferences.
* The right to limit the use of your sensitive personal information, which you can exercise through the [contact form](https://www.landsend.com/customer-privacy) available on our Site- if beyond what is necessary for providing goods and services.

You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf on our Site through our [contact form](https://www.landsend.com/customer-privacy). When you exercise these rights and submit a request to us, we will verify your identity by asking you to provide us with additional information such as your email address, order numbers of previous orders of our products and services, or the last four digits of a credit or debit card used to make a purchase or other means to verify your identity. We also may use a third-party verification provider to verify your identity. We will endeavor to honor such requests unless such a request conflicts with certain lawful exemptions under California’s consumer privacy law.

We do not discriminate against California residents who exercise any of their rights described in our Privacy Policy. Your exercise of these rights will have no adverse effect on the price and quality of our goods or services.

In addition, and as set forth below, California law requires us to identify, for the 12-month period prior to the date of this Privacy Policy, what information we may have “sold” or “shared” about you. For the 12-month period prior to the date of this Privacy Policy, Lands’ End has only sold personal information about its customers as described above.

**Opt-Out Preference Signals:** We are working toward enabling Global Privacy Control (GPC) as an additional way for you to submit a request to opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information through browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal. Until then, you can opt out of the use of third-party cookies for personalized advertising by setting the cookie preferences on your browser.

This Privacy Policy describes how we may share your information for marketing purposes, as described above. If you are a California resident, the Shine the Light law permits you to request and obtain from us once per calendar year information about any of your personal information shared with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, including the categories of information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we have shared such information.
