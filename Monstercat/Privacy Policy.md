Privacy Policy
==============

Monstercat Inc. (“Monstercat” “we” or “us”) is the owner and operator of our website (the “Website”) and the provider of the Services (as defined in our Terms of Service). Monstercat respects your privacy, and we created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain how we collect, use and disclose your information when you access the Website and use the Services. The Policy is only applicable to the Website and our Services and not to any other website, service or online platform. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service. BY ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, UTILIZING ANY OF THE SERVICES AND/OR PURCHASING ANYTHING ON THE WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS POLICY, INCLUDING OUR TERMS OF SERVICE, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

Section 1 - Our Use Of Your Information
---------------------------------------

Our primary purpose in collecting information, both Personal Information and other, is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your information to: (a) provide the Services and customer support for your requests; (b) troubleshoot problems and prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; © customize, measure and improve our Services, content and advertising; (d) tell you about our Services, targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; (e) monitor and enforce our Terms of Service; (f) ensure the fulfillment of any purchases made through the Website; (g) screen Website activity for potential risk or fraud; (h) communicate with users of the Website about products and/or services they may be interested in; (i) verify your eligibility to use the Website; and (j) any other reason permitted under applicable laws.

Section 2 -types Of Information Collected
-----------------------------------------

### Personal Information

When you fill out a form, purchase something on the Website, email us directly or sign up for a service, Monstercat may ask you for some or all of the following types of information which may be identifiable to you when you access various content or features on the Website, or directly contact the Website: (i) contact information, such as your email address and name; (ii) your age; and (iii) information for the purpose of authenticating yourself if we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that you may be violating Website policies or for any other reason we deem necessary (collectively “Personal Information”). You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all Personal Information you submit to Monstercat.We collect and store all Personal Information you submit to us voluntarily through registering with us or uploading or posting content through the Website or Services. We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your Personal Information, without your consent, except as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy.

We may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties, such as music service partners, partners with whom we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities and social media platforms. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this Policy and we also apply any additional restrictions imposed by the source of data.

### Non-Personal Information

In general, you can visit the Website without telling us who you are or submitting any Personal Information. However, we and/or our service providers collect IP (Internet protocol) addresses from all visitors to the Website and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on the Website. This information is used to help us understand the Website activity, and to monitor and improve the Website.

### Cookies

The Website uses a technology called ‘cookies’. A cookie is a tiny element of data that the Website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. We use cookies on the pages on the Website where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable. If you have a registered account on the Website, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) may be necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize the Website in accordance with your preferences. We also use cookies to help us understand the Website activity, to improve the Website and provide better customer service.

You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from the Website, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of the Website. Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signal whereby you may indicate your preference regarding tracking and cross-site tracking. Although we do not currently employ technology that recognizes DNT signals, we will only process your personal data in accordance with this Policy. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent use of the Services. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions for removal of cookies. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if cookies are disabled.

Generally, our cookies perform up to three different functions:

* **Essential cookies.** Some cookies are essential for the operation of the Website. If you opt to disable these cookies, you will not be able to access or use all of the features that the Website incorporates.
    
* **Performance Cookies.** We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use the Website and to monitor performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.
    
* **Functionality Cookies.** We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences, such as your customisation preferences.
    
* **Targeting Cookies.** We use targeting in order to be able to deliver targeted advertising.
    

We do use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the four categories above. For example, like many companies, we use third party analytic tools such as Google Analytics, to help us monitor our traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our applicable policies.

As we have explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of the Website. However, if you do wish to disable cookies then you can do so by amending the settings within your browser or mobile device. Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of the Website do not work properly.

If you have any queries or comments regarding the use of cookies on our website, please contact us by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.monstercat.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

### Web Beacons

The Website may employ a software technology called ‘tracer tags’ or ‘web beacons’ (also known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels). This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on the Website and tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor the Website for you and other future visitors to the Website. This help us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third-party partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you.

### Social Media plug-ins

We may also use so-called “social media plug-ins” on our Website from organizations such as Facebook, Google/YouTube, Instagram, Twitter TikTok and Twitch. Pages of a website that contain such a social plug-in, allow the user’s browser to connect directly to the social media organization’s servers. Via such plug-ins, social media organizations may receive the information that you have visited our Website even if you do not have a profile or are not currently logged in. This information (including your IP address) will be transferred from your browser directly to a server of the respective social media organization and stored there. If you are logged in to a social media organization’s services, a provider may allocate your visit of the Website to your account with such organization. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing of your data by the providers as well as your relevant rights and setting options for the protection of your privacy can be found in the privacy notices of the social media organizations.

### Information Collected Automatically

When you browse the Website, we automatically receive and collect information such as your IP address, the URLs of websites you arrive at Monstercat from or leave Monstercat to go to, your type of browser and language, access times, and the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us. We may use such information to better understand how Monstercat visitors use the Website, to analyze trends, administer the Website, prevent fraud, and gather broad demographic information. Please note that we do not alter the Website’s data collection and use practices when we see a DNT signal from your browser.

### Consent

When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no. If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.monstercat.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

### Section 3 - Disclosure
