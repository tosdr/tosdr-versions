(b) **Product Information and Pricing Changes and Errors Occur.** While we endeavor to provide accurate product information, product information accessed through the Sites is obtained from claims made by product manufacturers; on occasion manufacturers may alter their labels or ingredient lists; and actual product packaging and materials may contain more and/or different information than that shown on the Sites.

You should not rely solely on the Medical Content nor use it as a self-diagnosis or for treating a health problem or disease.

The Medical Content does not cover all possible uses, precautions, side effects and interactions of any prescription or over-the-counter drug and should not be construed to indicate that any such drug is safe for you. Consult your qualified health-care provider for guidance before using any prescription or over-the-counter drug and regarding the applicability of any opinion, research result, or recommendation with respect to any symptom or medical condition. Always seek the advice of your qualified health-care provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or change in health. Never disregard or delay in seeking professional medical advice because of something you have read on any of the Sites. Contact your qualified health-care provider immediately if you suspect that you have a medical problem. The Company does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, products, procedures, methods, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on or included in the Sites.

All stated nutritional values are composite averages and may vary according to freshness, variety, differences in preparation or brands of ingredients. Altering cooking methods or substituting any ingredients may change the posted nutritional information significantly.

Also, the Sites may provide information about food handling and preparation methods. Such information is not intended to be comprehensive and should not be substituted for information available from applicable governmental sources.

Check these Terms in the App or online periodically to access our most current Terms. To use the App, you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the mobile service.

You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or create derivative works of the App, except to the extent that the law expressly prohibits such a limitation on you; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the App to any third party or use the App to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit or distribute the App in any way, unless specifically allowed in these Terms; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the App; (v) delete the copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights notices on the App; or (vi) create another app to sniff, phish, scrape, or otherwise monitor The Company Apps unless allowed by the platform for all apps on the Android and iOS platforms.

These Online Ordering Services Terms, in addition to the Terms, apply to users who order Offerings from Company or products from Seller (as defined below) through the Online Grocery Ordering Service for delivery or pickup, where we offer such Offerings. Certain third-party sellers ("Sellers") operate storefronts and sell products through a third-party seller hub on the Online Grocery Ordering Service (the "Safeway Marketplace"). If you purchase any Seller(s) products via the Safeway Marketplace, you are purchasing directly from those Sellers, not from Company. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings and/or products of any of these Sellers (including the content of their sites). To the fullest extent provided by applicable law, Company has no responsibility or liability for any Seller, their products, or representations. Company does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and/or content of or for any of these Sellers.

In addition, portions of these Online Ordering Services Terms apply to users who order Special Order Items, such as deli platters, custom cakes and bakery items, or holiday meals, from certain stores that have implemented a separate Catering Order Service specifically for Special Order Items. These Online Ordering Services Terms do not apply to purchases you make as a shopper at any of our physical stores or to our in-store promotions, programs, and offers (e.g., Monopoly Game), which may not be available to our Online Grocery Ordering Service customers.

If you place an order for Offerings via any third-party website or mobile application, whether or not we direct you to the third-party site or application, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that third party service provider and we are not responsible for the terms, policies, actions or inactions of that third party service provider. If you access the third party's site or application to place your order, your order will be subject to the terms, policies, actions, or inactions of such third party.

References on our Sites to any names, marks, Offerings, or services of third parties, or links to third-party sites or information, are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or its information, Offerings, or services.

During the registration process, you may be asked to provide information (or confirm information that auto-fills) about your participation in Company Loyalty Programs, such as a whether you have a club card or telephone number you already use in-store to receive Offering price discounts or accrue rewards program benefits. If this information is provided during the registration process, any loyalty benefits that you may earn on orders placed online, such as rewards points that can be redeemed for gas or groceries, or discount offers based on your shopping behavior, typically will be available when using that Company Loyalty Programs card or telephone number in-store and vice-versa. If you are participating in an existing Company Loyalty Program at the time you register for an Account in the Online Grocery Ordering Service, but such information is not filled in, the Online Grocery Ordering Service will assign the Account a virtual Company Loyalty Programs number. This virtual Company Loyalty Programs number will enable you to receive Offering price discounts available to participants in Company Loyalty Programs if and when those discounts are provided through the Online Grocery Ordering Service. However, other benefits that may be earned for orders placed online, such as rewards points ordinarily redeemable for grocery or gas rewards, will not be available when using your existing Company Loyalty Programs number in-store.

In addition, in some areas, different Company banners will partner with each other to deliver online orders. In those cases, the pricing, rewards programs and discounts applicable to your order placed through the Online Grocery Ordering Service will be that of the Company banner fulfilling the order. You may apply for the partnering banner's Company Loyalty Programs for use with your Online Grocery Ordering Service Account. For questions or assistance regarding Company Loyalty Programs when using the Online Grocery Ordering Service, contact Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040.

5\. Placing an Order in the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
------------------------------------------------------------

(a) **You Must Make a Minimum Purchase.** The minimum purchase amount shown in the Online Grocery Ordering Service must be met to place an order. The minimum purchase amount is shown as the "Subtotal of All Items" (which we refer to as the "Subtotal" of the order in these Online Ordering Services Terms), and is the sum total of the order calculated from the quantities and online prices for the Offerings selected, but excluding all other charges, fees and discounts, such as any applicable taxes, service or delivery fees, bag fees, bottle/container deposits, promotional discounts not reflected in the online prices for the Offerings, and in certain jurisdictions alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy Offerings. In addition, certain offers may specify a potentially different minimum purchase amount to receive a discount. In those cases, the Subtotal of All Items, minus certain Offerings such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy must equal the stated minimum, in order for you to receive the discount or all of these disclaimers may not apply to you. We may change the minimum purchase amount at any time, without notice to you.

(b) **We May Limit Quantities.** We reserve the right to limit the quantity of any particular Offering ordered in our discretion, including without limitation, due to inventory control or other reasons. Offering availability is subject to the inventory on hand and may vary geographically or change without notice. Please note that we reserve the right to source the Offerings from any of our stores in any location (or the stores of any of our affiliated companies or Sellers in any location).

(c) **You Agree to Pay for Your Order.** By submitting an order via the Online Grocery Ordering Service, you offer to purchase the Offering(s)specified in your order. We will send you an electronic confirmation that your order has been received and the offer accepted, subject to our final confirmation of Offering availability and price; however, we also reserve the right to cancel your order, in whole or in part, at any time in our sole discretion, and to refuse to provide delivery/pickup service for any order, in whole or in part. Subject to the foregoing, if your order is accepted by Company, and not cancelled prior to delivery, Company will provide the Offering(s) ordered in return for your payment and deliver the ordered items to the delivery address or pickup location you designate in your order, subject to the provisions of the Terms and these Online Ordering Services Terms.

(d) **We Accept Major Credit and Debit Cards and Certain Other Payment Methods.** You must select one of the payment methods identified in the Online Grocery Ordering Service and provide accurate and complete information for us to charge your payment method for orders you place. By providing payment card information, you consent to and authorize storage of your card data (name, credit/debit card number, expiration date) for purposes of future online transactions, all transactions made via the Sites and the Company charging your selected payment method in the amount of each such transaction. Order processing will not occur until authorized. When processing credit or debit card payments, we will run a temporary pre-authorization hold. Your bank may take up to 5 business days after delivery/pickup to release the hold and display your final charge.

In addition to major credit and debit cards, we accept Electronic Benefit Transfer (“EBT”) as a method of payment, which is a PIN-based transaction. Upon entry of the correct PIN, we assume the person entering the PIN is authorized to make SNAP and/or EBT Cash purchases with the card used for SNAP or EBT Cash payment at our Sites. When you enter EBT card details, we will store a tokenized version of your card number for future transactions. You may choose to not have your EBT card number stored by unchecking the box.

Only one EBT card may be associated with your account number pursuant to United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), Food and Nutrition Service ("FNS"), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ("SNAP") regulations.

SNAP benefits may not be used to pay for any items or charges that are non-SNAP eligible. Non-SNAP eligible charges include, but are not limited to, tips, delivery fees, service fees, ordering fees or convenience fees that may apply to online orders while using the Site. For complete details on what are eligible items using SNAP funds, go to [https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items).

EBT Cash may be used the same as cash to pay for SNAP eligible items, non-SNAP eligible items, fees, other charges, and taxes, as permitted by the laws of your state. Several states have laws placing restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EBT Cash. Please consult your state's EBT guidelines on what may be purchased using EBT Cash.

Customers who use EBT as a form of payment may choose to allocate how much in funds to apply across SNAP, EBT Cash and other payment types. Customers who have a valid EBT card number saved as a payment type with us are not subject to meet minimum dollar amounts in order to checkout. The maximum amount applied to SNAP is limited to the SNAP-eligible total amount of the order, or the account holder’s balance, whichever is the lower. If your order is canceled after your EBT card has been debited, we will promptly issue a refund back to the EBT account type you used, and you will receive an email notification within twenty-four (24) hours of the cancellation event.

Because random weight items (such as meat and produce) may vary in weight and price, in accordance with the SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot guidelines, we apply a 10% surcharge at checkout on such items. At the day and time your order is fulfilled and processed, if the actual price of the random weight item is less than what you paid at checkout when you placed the order with the surcharge, we will refund the difference to you.

You represent and warrant to Company that your use of your selected payment method(s) for Online Grocery Ordering Service transactions is authorized and legal. It is your responsibility to promptly notify your bank, financial institution, or other responsible party of any changes to your billing information, or the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your payment method. You are responsible for updating your payment information with Company whenever it is no longer current/accurate.

(e) **Your Total at Checkout Is an Estimate.** The dollar amount displayed prior to order completion is only an estimate, based on Offerings selected and prices at the time of ordering, and estimated product weights for certain Offerings in your order, as adjusted by some (but not all) potentially applicable additional charges and fees and potentially applicable discounts and other deductions (collectively, the "Estimated Total"). **The actual amount that you will be charged for the order will be based on the prices, charges, fees, offers, promotions, programs, coupons, discounts, and deductions applicable to the order at the time of online checkout, regardless of the date of the scheduled delivery/checkout** (collectively, the "Final Total"). The Final Total cannot be determined until the day and time the order is sourced and processed for multiple reasons, including without limitation: (i) the availability of the Offerings selected and the need to substitute different priced Offerings cannot be confirmed until the day and time that they are prepared for delivery/pickup, (ii) Offering weights and prices, as well as available promotions, may vary between the date you submit the order and the date and time that the order is prepared for delivery/pickup, and (iii) certain charges, such as any applicable taxes, bottle deposits, and bag charges, cannot be determined until the order is prepared for delivery/pickup. In addition, even though we make an effort to describe and display our Offerings accurately on the Sites, Offerings on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable and we may experience delay in updating information on the Sites and in our advertising on the Sites. **The Final Total that you will be charged for your order upon sourcing and processing likely will not equal exactly the Estimated Total.**

(f) **When the Final Total Is Due.** Your payment of the Final Total amount for each order, including all applicable fees, taxes, and charges, will be charged as part of the order sourcing and processing procedure, but in any event is due no later than when the order is delivered or picked up. Company will charge the Final Total amount for the order to the payment method you selected during the order submission process. You authorize Company to make and collect such payment and charge. You acknowledge that if we cannot collect the charge for any reason, we may elect to turn the matter over to a collection agency.

(g) **Changing or Canceling Your Order.** Typically, you may cancel or change your order made on the Online Grocery Ordering Service up until the date and time noted in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. All times listed are in the local time zone for your specified delivery/pickup location, regardless of the time zone you might be in when placing the order. Note that any changes you may make to orders may affect whether your order continues to qualify for the same prices, discounts, promotions, or Promo Code Deals as your original order. If your changed order will qualify for a Promo Code Deal that your original order did not and you are unable to enter the Promo Code during the Order Edit process, make a note of the Promo Code Deal(s) and call our Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040 after your order is delivered/picked up, if the discount has not been applied. You may also change the delivery/pickup day and time after submitting your order, subject to order cut off times and the availability of your desired delivery/pickup time at the time you request a change. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. Please note that changing your delivery/pickup date, if allowed, may affect Product prices and availability, as well as the availability of certain offers, discounts, and promotions.

6\. Offering Pricing, Fees and Other Charges.
---------------------------------------------

(a) **Prices, Fees and Other Charges**.

(1) **Online Prices. Prices for Offerings you order for delivery or pickup through the Online Grocery Ordering Service may be higher than the prices for such Offerings in our physical stores.** Pricing may differ depending on the fulfillment method you select, e.g., delivery, pickup, rush delivery. In addition, in some locations, order fulfillment and delivery may be provided by another of the Company's banners or affiliates or an independent third party service provider that provides selection and/or delivery services to consumers. In those cases, the availability, fees, and pricing of the partnering banner may apply to your order. For Offerings sold by weight, a representative cost per unit may be used to calculate the Estimated Total. The actual cost will be determined when the order is prepared for pickup or delivery and that cost will be reflected in the Final Total, which may be higher or lower than the estimate. Offerings offered with a price discount for participants in Company Loyalty Programs online may differ from Offerings offered with such a price discount in our physical stores.

(2) **Delivery Fees.** We charge a non-refundable delivery fee on all delivery orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, unless expressly stated with a particular order, which will be included in both the Estimated Total for your order and the Final Total charged for that order. A delivery fee helps operate our fleet of trucks that transports your order from our store to your delivery address (or in the case of Safeway Marketplace, helps our Sellers to deliver products directly to you). From time to time, we may waive or provide discounts off our regular delivery fees for certain delivery times, which you may obtain by selecting such delivery time. We may also make other discounts available in certain locations via a Promo Code, in which case, you must enter the required Promo Code when you place your order and your order must meet any conditions of the offer, such as a minimum purchase amount. Service fees still apply. Promo Code offers for discounted or free delivery/pickup orders are not valid in Lake Powell. In some locations, we may also offer a subscription to delivery services on a recurring monthly or annual fee-paid basis, which may reduce or eliminate delivery or delivery and service fees on individual orders. The delivery fee does not constitute a tip to the delivery person.

(3) **Service Fees.** We may charge a non-refundable service fee on all delivery/pickup orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, which will be included in both the Estimated Total and the Final Total for the order. A service fee helps operate our in-store processes for picking and preparing online orders, as well as operate our online processes and platforms. The service fee does not constitute a tip to the delivery person.

(4) **Governmental Fees and Taxes.** In addition to the fees and charges stated above, all governmental fees and taxes, including without limitation, sales tax, sweetened beverage taxes, bottle and container deposits, bottled water charges, and bag fees, which apply to your order will be included in the Final Total amount.

(5) **Tax Exempt Orders.** The Online Grocery Ordering Service cannot verify documentation that certain organizations may normally present during in-store transactions to avoid the collection of sales tax due to their nonprofit nature.

(6) **Fee Changes.** Company reserves the right to add, delete or change any fees or other charges applicable to the Online Grocery Ordering Service at any time.

(b) **Price Changes.** Please note that Offering prices are subject to change without notice and may vary geographically.

7\. Availability of Promotional Offers and Coupons on the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) **Promotional Offers.** Discounts available through some, but not all, promotional offers will appear in your Estimated Total at checkout. However, all discounts for which your order is eligible will be reflected in the Final Total for such order. Note that to be eligible for ‘for U™ Program’ promotions, you must have provided/confirmed information about your participation in the for U™ Program at the time you registered for your Account or through Customer Service. In addition, some for U™ Program promotions are valid in a limited geographic area and the store fulfilling your order may not fall within the applicable zone, in which case, you will not receive affected for U™ Program offers. To be eligible for promotions that require entry of a Promo Code, you must have entered the applicable Promo Code. To be eligible for promotions that require a minimum purchase amount, you must have met the minimum purchase amount. Note that some items are excluded from the calculation of the minimum purchase, such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and fluid dairy. All promotional offers are valid through their stated expiration dates, may be limited to specific quantities, are valid while supplies last and are limited to quantities on hand. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of any promotional offer and acknowledge that circumvention of the terms and conditions of any such offer (including without limitation, opening multiple Accounts) constitutes an unauthorized or fraudulent act. You will be liable for damages caused by any such unauthorized or fraudulent act, and Company reserves the right to charge the payment method in your Account an amount equal to such damages.

(b) **Coupons.** We do not accept printed coupons for orders through our Online Grocery Ordering Service. Where our for U™ Program is offered, we do accept for U™ Program digital offers that you have uploaded to your Account, within the geographic zone to which the offer is applicable. Digital coupons other than ones obtained through the for U™ Program may not be used in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. Applicable for U™ Program digital coupons will be applied to your order on the day of delivery/pickup, provided you provided or confirmed information about your participation in for U™ Program when you registered for your Account or through Customer Service. For questions or assistance regarding Company Loyalty Programs when using the Online Grocery Ordering Service, contact Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040.

(c) **Variations in Availability of Promotional Offers, Coupons, Etc.** Offers, promotions, programs, coupons, discounts, and deductions applicable to Offering purchases at our physical stores in some cases **may not** apply to orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, **and vice versa**. Similarly, some promotions, discounts, and offers are valid in a limited geographic area and the store fulfilling your order may not fall within the applicable zone, in which case, you will not receive affected promotions, discounts, or offers.

We reserve the right to request that valid (non-expired, government issued) photo identification, the credit card used to place the applicable order, or other personal information be provided and/or presented to the store attendant upon arrival to the designated pickup location for verification purposes.

Albertsons Companies Dispute Resolution Terms
=============================================

PER SECTION 24 OF THE COMPANY’S [TERMS OF USE](https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/policies-and-disclosures/terms-of-use/default.aspx#section-24), ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR ACCOUNT, ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE COMPANY’S SERVICES, PURCHASES FROM THE COMPANY; THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION BY OR FOR THE COMPANY, ANY ASPECT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP OR INTERACTIONS WITH THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OR ANOTHER EXCEPTION APPLIES. THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS CONTAIN PROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO MASS ARBITRATION.

WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, YOU AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT SUE IN COURT, HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS. THE COMPANY AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

1. **Claims Subject to this Section**. These Dispute Resolution Terms apply to all Claims between you and the Company. A “Claim” is any dispute, claim, cause of action, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed in Section 4) between you and the Company, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, as permitted by law, that arises from or relates to your Account; access to or use of the Company’s Services; purchases from the Company; the use of your information by or for the Company; any aspect of your relationship or interactions with the Company as a consumer or potential consumer; the arbitrability, validity, enforceability, or scope of these Terms or any portion of them.
  
3. **Customer Service Resolution.**Our Customer Support Center is available to address any concerns you may have regarding your Account, access to or use of the Company’s Services, purchases from the Company, the use of your information by or for the Company, or any aspect of your relationship or interactions with the Company. You may contact them by phone at 877-723-3929; on-line at [https://www.albertsons.com/inquiry/contact-us.html](https://www.albertsons.com/inquiry/contact-us.html)
  
5. **Required Informal Dispute Resolution.** Except as permitted under Section 4, if you have a Claim against the Company or if the Company has a Claim against you, you and the Company must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally before either party may bring the Claim in arbitration. You and the Company will make a good-faith effort to negotiate for 45 days the resolution of any Claim or for a longer period as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by you and the Company (“Informal Resolution Period”) from the day you or the Company receive a written notice of a Claim from the other party (a “Claimant Notice”) in accordance with this Section 3.
    
    You will send any Claimant Notice to the Company by certified mail addressed to Customer Support Center, Albertsons Companies, Inc., M/S 10501 P.O. Box 29093, Phoenix, AZ 85038-9093. The Company will send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to the Company, including the email address associated with your Account or the Company. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must (i) include the sender’s name, address, email address, telephone number, and any relevant Account or purchase information; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief requested.
    
    The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of resolution if it chooses to do so. You or the Company cannot file a Claim in arbitration (or court in accordance with Section 4) before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or the Company file a Claim in arbitration or court without complying with all the requirements in these Dispute Resolution Terms, including waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court to enjoin the filing and seek damages from the party who has not followed the requirements in this Section 3, including to reimburse that party for any costs and fees—including arbitration fees, attorney fees, and expert fees—incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.
    
    The statute of limitations and any filing-fee deadlines for a Claim will be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that Claim so that you and the Company can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.
    
6. **Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions.**Except for Claims (i) exclusively related to the intellectual-property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights) of you or the Company, including any disputes in which you or the Company seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use or infringement of your or the Company’s intellectual property or other infringement of your or the Company’s intellectual-property rights (“IP Claims”) or (ii) that are properly asserted in small-claims court (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar representative actions or relief), all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual property or intellectual-property rights but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 3 will only be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Such Claims include, without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including the arbitrability, validity, enforceability, or scope of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration provision.
  
8. **Binding Individual Arbitration.** Subject to the terms of this Section 5, a Claim not excluded under Section 4 may only be resolved by binding individual arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), https://adr.org/, according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”). For Claims arbitrated by the AAA, if you are a “Consumer,” meaning that you only use an Account and/or the Services for personal, family, or household purposes, the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are the rules applicable to Claims between you and the Company as modified by these Terms (the “Rules”). For Claims that must be arbitrated by the AAA, if you are not a Consumer, the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures are the Rules applicable to Claims between you and the Company as modified by these Dispute Resolution Terms.
    
    If the AAA notifies the parties in writing (email suffices) that it is not available to arbitrate any Claim, that Claim may only be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator of National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), www.namadr.com/, according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“FAA”). For Claims arbitrated by NAM, the then-current version of NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures are the Rules applicable to Claims between you and the Company as modified by these Dispute Resolution Terms.
    
    This agreement to arbitrate affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of these Terms will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Dispute Resolution Terms, and the applicable Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Claim in arbitration and to grant any remedy or relief that would be available in a court under law or in equity, including the power to determine all questions of arbitrability. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or the Company to satisfy one of our individual Claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties understand that absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
    
    You or the Company may initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA in accordance with the Rules (or with NAM in accordance with the Rules if applicable pursuant to this Section 5). Instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling the AAA at 800-778-7879, and instructions for filing a demand for arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by calling NAM at 800-358-2550. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to the Company by certified mail addressed to Customer Support Center, Albertsons Companies, Inc., M/S 10501 P.O. Box 29093, Phoenix, AZ 85038-9093. The Company will send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using the contact information you have provided to the Company, including the email address associated with your Account. You and the Company both agree that the arbitrator must follow the terms of this agreement to arbitrate.
    
    Any such arbitration shall be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration agreement set forth in these Dispute Resolution Terms shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims. Any such claims so released from arbitration must be resolved in accordance with Section 13.
    
9. **Arbitration Fees.** Except for the circumstances outlined in Sections 7 and 8 and for Mass Arbitrations (as defined in Section 10), to the extent the initial-filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial-filing fee for a lawsuit, the Company will pay the difference in fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you and the Company have 90 days from receipt of an arbitration-fee invoice to pay the invoiced arbitration fees.
  
11. **Frivolous or Improper Claims.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs incurred by the responding party, including any attorney fees, related to a Claim if an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument or (ii) the Claim was filed in arbitration for any improper purpose, such as to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or increase the cost of dispute resolution.
  
13. **Offers of Settlement.** Either party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer for a Claim. If an arbitration decision or award is later issued that is less favorable to a party than the last written offer of settlement that party did not accept, that party must pay all costs and fees—including arbitration fees—incurred by the other party after the written settlement offer was made.
  
15. **Confidentiality.** If you or the Company submits a Claim to arbitration, you and the Company agree to cooperate to seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade-secret, or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of any discovery in the arbitration. You and the Company agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.
  
17. **Mass Arbitration.** If 25 or more Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel as other Claimants, these will be considered “Mass Arbitrations” and will be treated as mass arbitrations according to the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (or if filed with NAM, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), if and to the extent Mass Arbitrations are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Dispute Resolution Terms. You or the Company may advise the other if you or the Company believe that Claims are Mass Arbitrations, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of “Mass Arbitrations” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. To the extent either party is asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, that party waives any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. The following procedures are intended to supplement the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules (or if filed with NAM, NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures), and to the extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede them.
    
    **Mass Arbitrations may only be filed in arbitration as permitted by the process set forth in the applicable Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and as supplemented below. Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for Claims asserted in a Mass Arbitration from the time a compliant Claimant Notice has been received by the Company until these Dispute Resolution Terms permit such Mass Arbitration to proceed in arbitration or court.**
    
    Initial Bellwether: The bellwether process set forth in this section will not proceed until counsel representing the Mass Arbitrations has advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Mass Arbitrations in their existing inventory have been submitted to the arbitration provider.
    
    After that point, counsel for the parties will select 20 Mass Arbitration claims to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the merits of its arguments. Each side will select 10 claimants who have submitted compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those chosen cases may proceed to be arbitrated by the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Mass Arbitration claims will be delayed by this bellwether process. Any remaining Mass Arbitration claims that are not selected for the bellwether shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those Claims, unless and until they are selected to proceed in individual arbitration proceedings as set out in this Section 10.
    
    A single arbitrator will preside over each individual arbitration in the Mass Arbitration chosen for a bellwether proceeding, however up to three individual arbitrations in the bellwether group of 20 may be arbitrated by the same arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.
    
    Mediation: Early mediation and dispute resolution of the Mass Arbitrations is encouraged. Consequently, in addition to an early mediation that shall take place within 90 days the filing of the Mass Arbitrations, once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the Company agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining claims in the Mass Arbitrations with the mediator’s fee paid for by the Company. Counsel for the claimants and the Company must agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the Company cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will cooperate to ensure that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as possible after the mediator is appointed.
    
    Remaining Claims: If after the initial set of bellwether claims are arbitrated and the subsequent mediation does not yield a global resolution of all remaining claims that are part of the Mass Arbitrations, the arbitration requirement in these Dispute Resolution Terms will no longer apply to Mass Arbitrations for which a compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the bellwether proceedings. Such Mass Arbitrations released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance with Section 13.
    
    Courts will have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation processes defined in this section and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.
    
18. **30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out this arbitration provision within 30 days of your first purchase from the Company after the date of these Terms of Use. You can opt out by going online at [https://www.safeway.com/inquiry/contact-us.html](https://www.safeway.com/inquiry/contact-us.html) and selecting “Other” in the Topic drop down and typing “Arbitration Opt-Out” in the comments, or by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: M.S. 10501 P.O. Box 29093, Phoenix, AZ 85038. Such notice must include the name of each person opting out and contact information for each such person and any relevant Membership or purchase information. If you send timely written notice containing the required information, then the arbitration requirement in these Dispute Resolution Terms will not apply to you or the Company. If you do not send such notice, you agree to arbitrate in accordance with these Dispute Resolution Terms.
  
20. **Enforcement.** If any part of these Dispute Resolution Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will no longer apply to the parties, but all other parts of these Dispute Resolution Terms will remain in effect unless otherwise provided herein. If the Company does not enforce any provision of these Dispute Resolution Terms, that will not be considered a waiver of the Company’s rights. Any waiver of these Dispute Resolution Terms must be obtained in a written document signed by an authorized representative of the Company.
    
    Except as otherwise provided in these Dispute Resolution Terms, if a Claim does not proceed in arbitration, the class-action waiver shall remain in effect, and a court may not preside over any action joining, coordinating, or consolidating the claims of multiple individuals in a single proceeding, except that you and the Company may participate in a classwide, collective, and/or representative settlement of Claims.
    
21. **Governing Law; Venue.** These Dispute Resolution Terms, all Claims, and any matter related to or arising from your Account, access to and use of the Services, and the relationship and interactions between you and the Company shall be subject to and governed by, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A. except for its conflict of law rules.
    
    All Claims not subject to arbitration pursuant to these Dispute Resolution Terms and that cannot be heard in small-claims court will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in Boise, Idaho.
