We do not guarantee the correctness, availability, usefulness, reliability, validity, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, correct sequencing, or suitability of the Content on the Sites, and Company shall not be liable for any errors or deficiencies in any Content on the Sites, or for any action or inaction taken by you in reliance thereon; unless and to the extent resulting from Company's grossly negligent, reckless or intentional acts. In particular, you should note the following:

(a) **Third Party Content.** Certain content from third parties ("Third Party Content") may be made available as part of the Sites or through links on the Sites, and such Third Party Content may be subject to its own additional license terms and policies. You should refer to the terms and policies posted on third party websites prior to using any such Third Party Content. Company does not endorse, oppose, or edit any opinion, claim, or analysis expressed by any third party or Third Party Content. You agree that Company is not responsible for the substance, availability, or accessibility of any Third Party Content accessible through the Sites and understand that you bear all risks associated with your access to and/or use of such Third Party Content.

(b) **Product Information and Pricing Changes and Errors Occur.** While we endeavor to provide accurate product information, you should know that product information accessed through the Sites is obtained from claims made by product manufacturers; on occasion manufacturers may alter their labels or ingredient lists; and actual product packaging and materials may contain more and/or different information than that shown on the Sites. Accordingly, you should not rely solely on the product information presented on the Sites, but should always read carefully the labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product and contact directly the product manufacturer for any questions. None of the entities associated with Company nor its Content provider(s) nor product manufacturers assume any liability for inaccuracies, misstatements, or omissions related to any product information listed on the Sites. In addition, even though we make an effort to describe and display our Offerings accurately on the Sites, Offerings on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable and we may experience delay in updating information on the Sites and in our advertising on the Sites.

(c) **Medical Content.** All drug and interaction information; health or wellness information; and any other content available in any pharmacy, nutrition, health, or wellness area of the Sites ("Medical Content") is provided for informational and educational purposes only and is intended as informational and not a substitute for, the diagnosis, treatment and advice of a qualified health-care provider. You should not rely solely on the Medical Content nor use it as a self-diagnosis or for treating a health problem or disease. Company does not represent or guarantee that any of the Medical Content is accurate, complete, correct, useful, valid, timely, reliable, suitable, or correctly sequenced. The Medical Content does not cover all possible uses, precautions, side effects and interactions of any prescription or over-the-counter drug and should not be construed to indicate that any such drug is safe for you. Consult your qualified health-care provider for guidance before using any prescription or over-the-counter drug, and regarding the applicability of any opinion, research result, or recommendation with respect to any symptom or medical condition. Always seek the advice of your qualified health-care provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or change in health. Never disregard or delay in seeking professional medical advice because of something you have read on any of the Sites. Contact your qualified health-care provider immediately if you suspect that you have a medical problem. Company does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, products, procedures, methods, opinions or other information that may be mentioned on or included in the Sites. Any information and statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.

(d) **Nutritional Content.** Any nutritional information about recipes provided on the Sites ("Nutritional Content") is based on the ingredients and cooking techniques as listed in the applicable recipe and does not include optional ingredients or garnishes. All stated nutritional values are composite averages and may vary according to freshness, variety, differences in preparation or brands of ingredients. Altering cooking methods or substituting any ingredients may change the posted nutritional information significantly. Company does not warrant the quality, completeness, or accuracy of recipes contained on the Sites or the results of preparing the recipes. Also, the Sites may provide information about food handling and preparation methods. Such information is not intended to be comprehensive and should not be substituted for information available from applicable governmental sources. Please be advised consuming raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, shellfish or eggs may increase your risk of food borne illnesses, especially if you have certain medical conditions.

Subject only to the provisions of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/policies-and-disclosures/privacy-policy/default.aspx), any comments or materials that you submit to Company, including, without limitation, any questions, comments, suggestions, or other feedback regarding Company, its Offerings, or any of the information on the Sites, ("Feedback") will be considered to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.

[Table of Contents](#toc-1)

21\. Our Liability is Limited.
------------------------------

**Important: To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances (other than injury to the person in the case of consumer goods) shall Company be liable for any consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or indirect damages, or any lost profits or lost revenues, resulting from, based on, or arising out of (i) your access or use of, or inability to access or use, the Sites and/or the Content; (ii) any transaction conducted through or facilitated by the Sites; (iii) any claim attributable to errors, omissions, deficiencies, or other inaccuracies in the Sites; (iv) any unauthorized access to, or use, disclosure or alteration of, your transmissions of data including, without limitation, your personal information or payment card information; (v) statements or conduct of any third party on the Sites; or (vi) any other matter related to the Sites, even if Company or a Company representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you hereunder.

24\. You Agree to Arbitrate Disputes and Will Not Be Part of a Class Action Against Us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Except for cases involving claims for public injunctive relief (as defined by law), you and Company agree that all controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Company relating to these Terms or arising out of your access to or use of any of the Sites (each a "Claim") will be resolved through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. **This agreement to arbitrate means that each of you and Company waive your/its respective rights to a jury trial**. Any and all Claims shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures that are in effect at the time arbitration is initiated ("JAMS Rules"). You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you under applicable federal, state or local laws, except as provided below in subsection (f) of this Section 24. If you decide to initiate arbitration, you agree to pay an arbitration initiation fee of $250 (unless the fee is waived as discussed in subsection (b)(4) of this Section 24), and Company will pay the remainder of the arbitration initiation fee and all other costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the arbitrator's fees. The arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area unless you and Company both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.

(b) For information on filing your Demand for Arbitration, you may contact JAMS toll free at (800) 352-5267. To start an arbitration hereunder, you must do all of the following:

(1) Write a demand for arbitration (your "Demand for Arbitration"). Your Demand for Arbitration must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered, and you must attach a copy of all of these Terms (including this arbitration provision). You can find a form of a demand for arbitration on the JAMS rules page at [http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/) .

(2) Send one copy of your Demand for Arbitration to Company at: Albertsons Companies, Inc., 250 E. Parkcenter Blvd., Boise, ID 83706 Attn: General Counsel.

(3) Send two copies of your Demand for Arbitration (with a copy of these Terms attached) and proof of service of your Demand for Arbitration on Company at the address noted in subsection (2) above (for example, a copy of a certified mail return receipt requested or a sworn statement of service by a non-party over 18 years of age) to the JAMS Resolution Center of your choice (JAMS Resolution Centers are listed at [http://www.jamsadr.com/locations/](https://www.jamsadr.com/locations/)).

(4) Pay JAMS a $250.00 arbitration initiation fee, unless you are entitled to a waiver of the fee under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1284.3 or other applicable law.

(c) In the event Company elects to start an arbitration with you hereunder, Company must write a demand for arbitration and send two copies of it to JAMS and serve one copy of Company's Demand for Arbitration to you at the contact information that we have on file for you. Company will pay all costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the arbitrator's fees, for any arbitration that Company commences.

(d) The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with JAMS Rules. The arbitrator shall render an award in accordance with JAMS Rules. In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Any award may also be challenged if the arbitrator awards any relief that could not be awarded under the laws of the state in which the arbitration is held or in which the award is to be enforced. Except for the foregoing, the arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. You and Company agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.

(e) The terms of this Section 24 do not preclude you or Company from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Company also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Company retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for public injunctive relief and/or provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.

(f) Neither you nor Company may act as a class representative, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Company's individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. Accordingly, you and Company agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to Company's arbitration. This arbitration provision and the procedures applicable to the arbitration contemplated by this provision are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any state law that may be applicable.

(g) A court may sever any portion of this Section 24 that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibitions on any Claim being handled on a class or representative basis. No waiver of any provision of this Section 24 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms. This Section 24 will survive the termination of your relationship with Company and any termination of your access to and/or use of all or any part of any of the Sites.

(g) **Important: This Section 24 limits certain rights, including the right to maintain a court action, the right to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery except as provided in the JAMS Rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. Other rights that you or Company would have in court also may not be available in arbitration.**

The Online Ordering Services Terms - Additional Terms Applicable to Users Who Place Online Orders

* * *

1\. The Online Ordering Services Terms **Apply to Online Orders.**
------------------------------------------------------------------

These Online Ordering Services Terms, in addition to the Terms, apply to users who order Offerings from Company or products from Seller (as defined below) through the Online Grocery Ordering Service for delivery or pickup, where we offer such Offerings. Certain third-party sellers ("Sellers") operate storefronts and sell products through a third-party seller hub on the Online Grocery Ordering Service (the "Safeway Marketplace"). If you purchase any Seller(s) products via the Safeway Marketplace, you are purchasing directly from those Sellers, not from Company. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings and/or products of any of these Sellers (including the content of their sites). To the fullest extent provided by applicable law, Company has no responsibility or liability for any Seller, their products, or representations. Company does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and/or content of or for any of these Sellers.

The Online Grocery Ordering Service may be accessed through our Sites; please note, however, that certain features available on a Company website for the Online Grocery Ordering Service may not be accessible via the mobile App and vice-versa. In addition, portions of these Online Ordering Services Terms apply to users who order Special Order Items, such as deli platters, custom cakes and bakery items, or holiday meals, from certain stores that have implemented a separate Catering Order Service specifically for Special Order Items. These Online Ordering Services Terms do not apply to purchases you make as a shopper at any of our physical stores or to our in-store promotions, programs, and offers (e.g., Monopoly Game), which may not be available to our Online Grocery Ordering Service customers.

If you place an order for Offerings via any third-party website or mobile application, whether or not we direct you to the third-party site or application, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that third party service provider and we are not responsible for the terms, policies, actions or inactions of that third party service provider. If you access the third party's site or application to place your order, your order will be subject to the terms, policies, actions, or inactions of such third party.

References on our Sites to any names, marks, Offerings, or services of third parties, or links to third-party sites or information, are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or its information, Offerings, or services. Company is not responsible for the content of any third-party linked site or any link contained in a linked site, including any third-party social media or mobile app platform with which our Sites operate or otherwise interact, nor is Company responsible for the acts or omissions of any operator of any such site or platform. Your use of any such third-party site or platform is at your own risk and will be governed by such third party's terms and policies (including its privacy policy).

2\. You Must Be 18 Years Old or Older to Order.
-----------------------------------------------

You must be age 18 or older and a resident of the United States in order to use either the Online Grocery Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service; provided, however, that you must be 21 or older to accept delivery/pickup of any alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings.

[Table of Contents](#toc-2)

3\. You Must Create an Account for the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the Online Grocery Ordering Service, you must create an Account, as provided in the Terms. Please note, if your Online Grocery Order includes a Seller or other third-party service provider (such as last-mile delivery provider), the personal information necessary will be disclosed to that party for the purpose of fulfilling your order. Company may use third party service providers to perform Offerings at its discretion, with no notice to you.

During the registration process, you may be asked to provide information (or confirm information that auto-fills) about your participation in Company Loyalty Programs, such as a whether you have a club card or telephone number you already use in-store to receive Offering price discounts or accrue rewards program benefits. If this information is provided during the registration process, any loyalty benefits that you may earn on orders placed online, such as rewards points that can be redeemed for gas or groceries, or discount offers based on your shopping behavior, typically will be available when using that Company Loyalty Programs card or telephone number in-store and vice-versa. If you are participating in an existing Company Loyalty Program at the time you register for an Account in the Online Grocery Ordering Service, but such information is not filled in, the Online Grocery Ordering Service will assign the Account a virtual Company Loyalty Programs number. This virtual Company Loyalty Programs number will enable you to receive Offering price discounts available to participants in Company Loyalty Programs if and when those discounts are provided through the Online Grocery Ordering Service. However, other benefits that may be earned for orders placed online, such as rewards points ordinarily redeemable for grocery or gas rewards, will not be available when using your existing Company Loyalty Programs number in-store.

In addition, in some areas, different Company banners will partner with each other to deliver online orders. In those cases, the pricing, rewards programs and discounts applicable to your order placed through the Online Grocery Ordering Service will be that of the Company banner fulfilling the order. You may apply for the partnering banner's Company Loyalty Programs for use with your Online Grocery Ordering Service Account. For questions or assistance regarding Company Loyalty Programs when using the Online Grocery Ordering Service, contact Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040.

4\. Additional Disclaimers.
---------------------------

**Important: In addition to the disclaimers set forth in the Terms and solely except as set forth in our Satisfaction Guarantee in Section 10 of these Online Ordering Services Terms, the Online Grocery Ordering Service and Catering Order Service are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, and to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Company disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement, with respect to the Online Grocery Ordering Service and Catering Order Service, any Offerings or Special Order Items purchased through the Online Grocery Ordering Service or Catering Order Service, and any delivery or pickup service. Company does not warrant that the Online Grocery Ordering Service or Catering Order Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the Online Grocery Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service will be free of viruses or other harmful components. Company does not make any representations or warranties regarding the access to or use of, or the results of the access to or use of, the Content on the Online Grocery Ordering Service or Catering Order Service in terms of their correctness, accuracy, validity, completeness, usefulness, timeliness, suitability, reliability, or otherwise.** Applicable law may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some or all of these disclaimers may not apply to you.

[Table of Contents](#toc-2)

5\. Placing an Order in the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
------------------------------------------------------------

(a) **You Must Make a Minimum Purchase.** The minimum purchase amount shown in the Online Grocery Ordering Service must be met to place an order. The minimum purchase amount is shown as the "Subtotal of All Items" (which we refer to as the "Subtotal" of the order in these Online Ordering Services Terms), and is the sum total of the order calculated from the quantities and online prices for the Offerings selected, but excluding all other charges, fees and discounts, such as any applicable taxes, service or delivery fees, bag fees, bottle/container deposits, promotional discounts not reflected in the online prices for the Offerings, and in certain jurisdictions alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy Offerings. In addition, certain offers may specify a potentially different minimum purchase amount to receive a discount. In those cases, the Subtotal of All Items, minus certain Offerings such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy must equal the stated minimum, in order for you to receive the discount or all of these disclaimers may not apply to you. We may change the minimum purchase amount at any time, without notice to you.

(b) **We May Limit Quantities.** We reserve the right to limit the quantity of any particular Offering ordered in our discretion, including without limitation, due to inventory control or other reasons. Offering availability is subject to the inventory on hand and may vary geographically or change without notice. Please note that we reserve the right to source the Offerings from any of our stores in any location (or the stores of any of our affiliated companies or Sellers in any location).

(c) **You Agree to Pay for Your Order.** By submitting an order via the Online Grocery Ordering Service, you offer to purchase the Offering(s)specified in your order. We will send you an electronic confirmation that your order has been received and the offer accepted, subject to our final confirmation of Offering availability and price; however, we also reserve the right to cancel your order, in whole or in part, at any time in our sole discretion, and to refuse to provide delivery/pickup service for any order, in whole or in part. Subject to the foregoing, if your order is accepted by Company, and not cancelled prior to delivery, Company will provide the Offering(s) ordered in return for your payment and deliver the ordered items to the delivery address or pickup location you designate in your order, subject to the provisions of the Terms and these Online Ordering Services Terms.

(d) **We Accept Major Credit and Debit Cards and Certain Other Payment Methods.** You must select one of the payment methods identified in the Online Grocery Ordering Service and provide accurate and complete information for us to charge your payment method for orders you place. By providing payment card information, you consent to and authorize storage of your card data (name, credit/debit card number, expiration date) for purposes of future online transactions, all transactions made via the Sites and the Company charging your selected payment method in the amount of each such transaction. Order processing will not occur until authorized. When processing credit or debit card payments, we will run a temporary pre-authorization hold. Your bank may take up to 5 business days after delivery/pickup to release the hold and display your final charge.

In addition to major credit and debit cards, we accept Electronic Benefit Transfer (“EBT”) as a method of payment, which is a PIN-based transaction. Upon entry of the correct PIN, we assume the person entering the PIN is authorized to make SNAP and/or EBT Cash purchases with the card used for SNAP or EBT Cash payment at our Sites. When you enter EBT card details, we will store a tokenized version of your card number for future transactions. You may choose to not have your EBT card number stored by unchecking the box.

Only one EBT card may be associated with your account number pursuant to United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), Food and Nutrition Service ("FNS"), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ("SNAP") regulations.

SNAP benefits may not be used to pay for any items or charges that are non-SNAP eligible. Non-SNAP eligible charges include, but are not limited to, tips, delivery fees, service fees, ordering fees or convenience fees that may apply to online orders while using the Site. For complete details on what are eligible items using SNAP funds, go to [https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items).

EBT Cash may be used the same as cash to pay for SNAP eligible items, non-SNAP eligible items, fees, other charges, and taxes, as permitted by the laws of your state. Several states have laws placing restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EBT Cash. Please consult your state's EBT guidelines on what may be purchased using EBT Cash.

Customers who use EBT as a form of payment may choose to allocate how much in funds to apply across SNAP, EBT Cash and other payment types. Customers who have a valid EBT card number saved as a payment type with us are not subject to meet minimum dollar amounts in order to checkout. The maximum amount applied to SNAP is limited to the SNAP-eligible total amount of the order, or the account holder’s balance, whichever is the lower. If your order is canceled after your EBT card has been debited, we will promptly issue a refund back to the EBT account type you used, and you will receive an email notification within twenty-four (24) hours of the cancellation event.

Because random weight items (such as meat and produce) may vary in weight and price, in accordance with the SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot guidelines, we apply a 10% surcharge at checkout on such items. At the day and time your order is fulfilled and processed, if the actual price of the random weight item is less than what you paid at checkout when you placed the order with the surcharge, we will refund the difference to you.

You represent and warrant to Company that your use of your selected payment method(s) for Online Grocery Ordering Service transactions is authorized and legal. It is your responsibility to promptly notify your bank, financial institution, or other responsible party of any changes to your billing information, or the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your payment method. You are responsible for updating your payment information with Company whenever it is no longer current/accurate.

(e) **Your Total at Checkout Is an Estimate.** The dollar amount displayed prior to order completion is only an estimate, based on Offerings selected and prices at the time of ordering, and estimated product weights for certain Offerings in your order, as adjusted by some (but not all) potentially applicable additional charges and fees and potentially applicable discounts and other deductions (collectively, the "Estimated Total"). **The actual amount that you will be charged for the order will be based on the prices, charges, fees, offers, promotions, programs, coupons, discounts, and deductions applicable to the order at the time of online checkout, regardless of the date of the scheduled delivery/checkout** (collectively, the "Final Total"). The Final Total cannot be determined until the day and time the order is sourced and processed for multiple reasons, including without limitation: (i) the availability of the Offerings selected and the need to substitute different priced Offerings cannot be confirmed until the day and time that they are prepared for delivery/pickup, (ii) Offering weights and prices, as well as available promotions, may vary between the date you submit the order and the date and time that the order is prepared for delivery/pickup, and (iii) certain charges, such as any applicable taxes, bottle deposits, and bag charges, cannot be determined until the order is prepared for delivery/pickup. In addition, even though we make an effort to describe and display our Offerings accurately on the Sites, Offerings on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable and we may experience delay in updating information on the Sites and in our advertising on the Sites. **The Final Total that you will be charged for your order upon sourcing and processing likely will not equal exactly the Estimated Total.**

(f) **When the Final Total Is Due.** Your payment of the Final Total amount for each order, including all applicable fees, taxes, and charges, will be charged as part of the order sourcing and processing procedure, but in any event is due no later than when the order is delivered or picked up. Company will charge the Final Total amount for the order to the payment method you selected during the order submission process. You authorize Company to make and collect such payment and charge. You acknowledge that if we cannot collect the charge for any reason, we may elect to turn the matter over to a collection agency.

(g) **Changing or Canceling Your Order.** Typically, you may cancel or change your order made on the Online Grocery Ordering Service up until the date and time noted in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. All times listed are in the local time zone for your specified delivery/pickup location, regardless of the time zone you might be in when placing the order. Note that any changes you may make to orders may affect whether your order continues to qualify for the same prices, discounts, promotions, or Promo Code Deals as your original order. If your changed order will qualify for a Promo Code Deal that your original order did not and you are unable to enter the Promo Code during the Order Edit process, make a note of the Promo Code Deal(s) and call our Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040 after your order is delivered/picked up, if the discount has not been applied. You may also change the delivery/pickup day and time after submitting your order, subject to order cut off times and the availability of your desired delivery/pickup time at the time you request a change. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. Please note that changing your delivery/pickup date, if allowed, may affect Product prices and availability, as well as the availability of certain offers, discounts, and promotions.

6\. Offering Pricing, Fees and Other Charges.
---------------------------------------------

(a) **Prices, Fees and Other Charges**.

(1) **Online Prices. Prices for Offerings you order for delivery or pickup through the Online Grocery Ordering Service may be higher than the prices for such Offerings in our physical stores.** Pricing may differ depending on the fulfillment method you select, e.g., delivery, pickup, rush delivery. In addition, in some locations, order fulfillment and delivery may be provided by another of the Company's banners or affiliates or an independent third party service provider that provides selection and/or delivery services to consumers. In those cases, the availability, fees, and pricing of the partnering banner may apply to your order. For Offerings sold by weight, a representative cost per unit may be used to calculate the Estimated Total. The actual cost will be determined when the order is prepared for pickup or delivery and that cost will be reflected in the Final Total, which may be higher or lower than the estimate. Offerings offered with a price discount for participants in Company Loyalty Programs online may differ from Offerings offered with such a price discount in our physical stores.

(2) **Delivery Fees.** We charge a non-refundable delivery fee on all delivery orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, unless expressly stated with a particular order, which will be included in both the Estimated Total for your order and the Final Total charged for that order. A delivery fee helps operate our fleet of trucks that transports your order from our store to your delivery address (or in the case of Safeway Marketplace, helps our Sellers to deliver products directly to you). From time to time, we may waive or provide discounts off our regular delivery fees for certain delivery times, which you may obtain by selecting such delivery time. We may also make other discounts available in certain locations via a Promo Code, in which case, you must enter the required Promo Code when you place your order and your order must meet any conditions of the offer, such as a minimum purchase amount. Service fees still apply. Promo Code offers for discounted or free delivery/pickup orders are not valid in Lake Powell. In some locations, we may also offer a subscription to delivery services on a recurring monthly or annual fee-paid basis, which may reduce or eliminate delivery or delivery and service fees on individual orders. The delivery fee does not constitute a tip to the delivery person.

(3) **Service Fees.** We may charge a non-refundable service fee on all delivery/pickup orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, which will be included in both the Estimated Total and the Final Total for the order. A service fee helps operate our in-store processes for picking and preparing online orders, as well as operate our online processes and platforms. The service fee does not constitute a tip to the delivery person.

(4) **Governmental Fees and Taxes.** In addition to the fees and charges stated above, all governmental fees and taxes, including without limitation, sales tax, sweetened beverage taxes, bottle and container deposits, bottled water charges, and bag fees, which apply to your order will be included in the Final Total amount.

(5) **Tax Exempt Orders.** The Online Grocery Ordering Service cannot verify documentation that certain organizations may normally present during in-store transactions to avoid the collection of sales tax due to their nonprofit nature.

(6) **Fee Changes.** Company reserves the right to add, delete or change any fees or other charges applicable to the Online Grocery Ordering Service at any time.

(b) **Price Changes.** Please note that Offering prices are subject to change without notice and may vary geographically.

[Table of Contents](#toc-2)

7\. Availability of Promotional Offers and Coupons on the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) **Promotional Offers.** Discounts available through some, but not all, promotional offers will appear in your Estimated Total at checkout. However, all discounts for which your order is eligible will be reflected in the Final Total for such order. Note that to be eligible for ‘for U™ Program’ promotions, you must have provided/confirmed information about your participation in the for U™ Program at the time you registered for your Account or through Customer Service. In addition, some for U™ Program promotions are valid in a limited geographic area and the store fulfilling your order may not fall within the applicable zone, in which case, you will not receive affected for U™ Program offers. To be eligible for promotions that require entry of a Promo Code, you must have entered the applicable Promo Code. To be eligible for promotions that require a minimum purchase amount, you must have met the minimum purchase amount. Note that some items are excluded from the calculation of the minimum purchase, such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and fluid dairy. All promotional offers are valid through their stated expiration dates, may be limited to specific quantities, are valid while supplies last and are limited to quantities on hand. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of any promotional offer and acknowledge that circumvention of the terms and conditions of any such offer (including without limitation, opening multiple Accounts) constitutes an unauthorized or fraudulent act. You will be liable for damages caused by any such unauthorized or fraudulent act, and Company reserves the right to charge the payment method in your Account an amount equal to such damages.

(b) **Coupons.** We do not accept printed coupons for orders through our Online Grocery Ordering Service. Where our for U™ Program is offered, we do accept for U™ Program digital offers that you have uploaded to your Account, within the geographic zone to which the offer is applicable. Digital coupons other than ones obtained through the for U™ Program may not be used in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. Applicable for U™ Program digital coupons will be applied to your order on the day of delivery/pickup, provided you provided or confirmed information about your participation in for U™ Program when you registered for your Account or through Customer Service. For questions or assistance regarding Company Loyalty Programs when using the Online Grocery Ordering Service, contact Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040.

(c) **Variations in Availability of Promotional Offers, Coupons, Etc.** Offers, promotions, programs, coupons, discounts, and deductions applicable to Offering purchases at our physical stores in some cases **may not** apply to orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, **and vice versa**. Similarly, some promotions, discounts, and offers are valid in a limited geographic area and the store fulfilling your order may not fall within the applicable zone, in which case, you will not receive affected promotions, discounts, or offers.

8\. Delivery/Pickup Options.
----------------------------

In locations where delivery or pickup service is offered, one or more fulfillment options may be available. The fulfillment options that are available to you will be displayed in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. We may add, modify, or discontinue any delivery, pickup, and/or other fulfillment services at any time, or increase or decrease features related thereto, with or without notice. In addition, in some cases, we may transfer your order to be fulfilled or delivered by a third party fulfillment partner. Please note, pickup and/or delivery options may be available through third-party platforms, websites, applications, or marketplaces, and in some cases, we may direct you to the third party’s website to place your order. If you place an order for Offerings via any third-party website, marketplace, platform, or application (collectively, "third party sites"), whether or not we direct you to the third-party site or application, or otherwise use any services provided by a third party, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that third party service provider and we are not responsible for the terms, policies, actions or inactions of that third party service provider. Company does not assume any responsibility for the (i) content of, (ii) technology implemented by, or (iii) privacy practices of third party sites and all use is at your own risk. You should review the privacy policy and terms of use for each third party site and confirm they are acceptable prior to registration on or use of the site. Links to third party sites do not imply endorsement of the sites by Company. In no event shall Company be liable, directly or indirectly, to anyone for any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by the use of the linked sites or the information or material accessed through such sites including, without limitation, any incidental, special, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, attorneys' fees and lost profits or savings.

(b) **Ordering Deadlines.** The date and time by which you must place your order for the type of service and delivery/pickup time you have selected will be shown in the Online Ordering Grocery Service. Note that cut-off times for different fulfillment methods, for example delivery, pick up, rush delivery, may differ. Cut-off times may vary by Offering and by store location. All times are listed in the local time zone for your specified delivery or pickup location, regardless of the time zone you might be in when placing the order. Special Order Items, such as a deli platter or custom cake, which are ordered less than 24 hours prior to planned pick up or delivery are not guaranteed. You may contact our Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040 to learn if your request can be accommodated.

(c) **Responsibility for Delivery Address.** We will deliver your order to a single delivery location you designate that is within the applicable delivery zone serviced by Company.

We have no liability for orders that cannot be delivered due to address error or inaccessibility.

(d) **Picking Up a Pickup Order.** Your order confirmation will include instructions about where to go to pick up your order. Plan to pick your order up at your selected time on the day it is ready for pickup. Any pickup orders not claimed by 8 PM local time on the day they are ready for pickup will be canceled and the Offerings restocked. We reserve the right to charge a restocking fee for orders that are restocked. We reserve the right to request that valid (non-expired, government issued) photo identification, the credit card used to place the applicable order, or other personal information be provided and/or presented to the store attendant upon arrival to the designated pickup location for verification purposes. If you send a person other than the individual whose name is on the order to pick up a pickup order, the person must either be designated in your order or from your household, and you consent to them receiving a copy of your receipt, if a receipt is provided by a store attendant. All information provided is subject to our Privacy Policy.

(e) **Receiving a Delivery or Pickup Order.** Someone over the age of 18 must be present to accept delivery or pickup orders. If your order contains alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings, someone over the age of 21 must be present to accept and/or sign for delivery or pickup. By placing an order through the Online Grocery Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service, you represent and warrant to us that a person age 18 or older, or age 21 or older in the case of orders containing alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings, will be present to receive the order, whether it be delivered or picked up.

The Offerings will be retained by the delivery driver or by the store attendant for pickup orders, unless someone over the required minimum age is at the delivery address when the delivery or pickup is attempted. You may contact our Customer Service line toll-free at (877) 505-4040 to arrange for re-delivery or to reschedule pickup of any Offerings retained in accordance with the foregoing. Please note that we may charge you an additional fee, or we may elect not to fulfill your request and cancel the order for the Offerings retained. We reserve the right to charge a restocking fee for orders that are restocked. We are now practicing contact-free social distancing for delivery and pickup, except in the case.

Albertsons Companies is not responsible for the times in your order once bags are left on your doorstep, including without limitation, any theft, spoilage, or damage. To maintain the integrity of your items, we recommend that you refrigerate or freeze perishable items upon receipt.

From time to time, certain Company banners and store locations may offer in-home delivery of items ordered through the Online Grocery Ordering Service of the Catering Ordering Service. If you place an order for in-home delivery of Offerings, you are: (i) authorizing Company, its employees, or its independent contractors, (“Delivery Personnel”) to access and enter your home in the manner you designated at time of order or via communication with Company or Delivery Personnel for the purpose of delivering your order, and (ii) confirming that you have the right to authorize Delivery Personnel to access and enter your home as you have designated.

You represent and warrant that you will make any and all other occupants within the home aware that an in-home delivery will be performed, and that Delivery Personnel are authorized to enter the home. You are responsible for compliance with the Terms and these Online Ordering Services Terms by other occupants within the home. You agree that you will contain any and all pets during any such in-home delivery.

(f) **Unattended Delivery.** Where available, this option may not be used for any orders containing alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and/or other age-restricted Offerings. If you select this option, the delivery driver will leave the Offerings in your order at your doorstep, in which case unrestricted access to your doorstep is required.

(g) **Responsibility for Items After Delivery/Pickup.** Company is not responsible for the Offerings in your order once they are picked up or delivered, including without limitation, for any theft, spoilage or damage. To maintain the integrity of Offerings after pickup or delivery, we recommend that you refrigerate or freeze perishable Offerings as soon as possible after pickup/delivery but no more than one hour after pickup/delivery.

(h) **Inclement Weather or Unforeseen Complications.** In the case of inclement weather or unforeseen delivery or pickup complications, it may be necessary to make adjustments to our delivery or pickup schedule which cause us to suspend chosen delivery or pickup dates and times. If there will be a significant delay in delivering or preparing your order for pickup, we may (but are not obligated to) call, email or text you to let you know the status of your order. If your designated delivery location is inaccessible on the date and time specified for delivery (such as due to a street closure or other complications), we will provide you with a full refund of your order. We will have no liability for any delay in delivery or pickup orders.

(i) **No Other Offerings.** Neither our delivery driver nor the store attendant assisting you with your pickup order are able to supply, retrieve or purchase on your behalf any Offerings that you did not order when placing your order.
