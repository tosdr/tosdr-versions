The moomoo app is an online trading platform offered by Moomoo Technologies Inc. Securities, brokerage products and related services available through the moomoo app are offered by including but not limited to the following brokerage firms: Moomoo Financial Inc. regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Moomoo Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd. regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Futu Securities International (Hong Kong) Limited regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC), Moomoo Financial Canada Inc. regulated by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and Moomoo Securities Australia Ltd regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).

For further information about Moomoo Financial Inc., please visit [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)’s BrokerCheck](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/283078). Brokerage accounts with Moomoo Financial Inc. are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Moomoo Financial Inc. is a member of Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). It is important to understand that SIPC protects customer accounts against losses caused by the financial failure of the broker-dealer, but not against an increase or decrease in the market value of securities in customers' accounts. SIPC does not protect against market risk, which is the risk inherent in a fluctuating market. For further information about SIPC coverage for accounts with Moomoo Financial Inc., see [www.sipc.org](https://www.sipc.org/) or request an explanatory brochure from Moomoo Financial Inc.

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all customers. It is important that investors read [Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options](https://j.us.moomoo.com/017Phl) before engaging in any options trading strategies. Options transactions are often complex and may involve the potential of losing the entire investment in a relatively short period of time. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk, including the potential for losses that may exceed the original investment amount. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.

Investments in stocks, options, ETFs and other instruments are subject to risks, including possible loss of the amount invested. The value of investments may fluctuate and as a result, clients may lose the value of their investment. Past performance should not be viewed as an indicator of future results.

Margin trading involves interest charges and heightened risks, including the potential to lose more than invested funds or the need to deposit additional collateral. Before trading on margin, customers are advised to determine whether this type of trading is appropriate for them in light of their respective investment objective, experience, risk tolerance and financial situation.

Free trading refers to $0 commissions for Moomoo Financial Inc. self-directed individual cash or margin brokerage accounts of U.S. residents that trade U.S. listed securities via mobile devices or Web. Relevant SEC & FINRA fees may apply. For details, please see [Commission and Fees](https://moomoo.com/us/pricing).

All types of investments are risky and investors may suffer losses. Past performance of investment products does not guarantee future results. Electronic trading also poses risks to investors. The responsiveness of the trading system may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Account access and trade execution may be affected by factors such as market volatility.
