Moomoo Technologies Inc. – Terms of Use
---------------------------------------

Last updated: August 14, 2024

Please read these Terms of Use (the “Agreement”) carefully. By downloading or using the App (as defined below), or otherwise indicating your agreement, you are consenting to this Agreement, including the associated schedules and policies referred to herein. At all times herein, “we” or “us” or “our” refers to Moomoo Technologies Inc. and “you” or "your” or “user” refers to the user who has opened an account with Moomoo Technologies Inc.

This Agreement is between you and Moomoo Technologies Inc. (“Moomoo”) concerning your use of (including any access to) our website(s), mobile and desktop applications known as “moomoo”, [https://www.moomoo.com](https://help.moomoo.com/), and any other Moomoo website or mobile application that posts a link to this Agreement (collectively, the “App”). You acknowledge that, through the App, Moomoo provides information and materials (collectively, the “Content”) and communications services (“Service”) that you may utilize to engage in self-directed securities trading through a brokerage account with an appropriately registered broker-dealer that has licensed the App for use by its customers (“broker-dealer”). The Content includes, without limitation, the Market Data discussed in Section 5 of this Agreement and the User Submissions discussed in Section 9 of this Agreement. You acknowledge that (a) Moomoo is not a broker-dealer; (b) Moomoo does not provide investment advice or make investment recommendations; (c) if you want to trade securities, you must open an account with a broker-dealer; (d) Moomoo does not make any recommendations with respect to your choice of a broker-dealer; (e) you are responsible for conducting your own review in selecting a broker-dealer of your choosing; and (f) if you open an account with a broker-dealer, your relationship with that broker-dealer will be governed by a customer services agreement between you and the broker-dealer.

YOU HEREBY AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OF THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU RESIDE AND CAPABLE OF FORMING A BINDING CONTRACT UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

This Agreement hereby incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions posted by Moomoo through the App, or otherwise made available to you by Moomoo. This Agreement is separate from any agreements that you may enter into with your broker-dealer, including any customer or account agreements and any other agreements that govern your use of software, products, goods, services, content, tools, and information provided by your broker-dealer.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 19 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.

1. Changes to this Agreement

We may revise this Agreement from time to time by updating this document. The most updated version of this Agreement will be made available for your review by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised Agreement under a link in the App or otherwise through the App (but no changes will apply to any dispute that previously arose between you and us).

You agree to review this Agreement periodically for changes. Your use of the App after any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of the changes. We (and/or a third party, as applicable) may, at any time, modify or discontinue all or part of the App (including the Content provided by such third party), or charge, change or waive any fees required to use the App.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moomoo will notify users of any material change to this Agreement, such as Moomoo’s ability to terminate the agreement, payment terms, liability, indemnity, Moomoo’s obligations and/or any of the user’s obligations. Such notification in respect of material changes to this Agreement will be provided through emails, website banners, the App pop-ups and any other way that can get the message across successfully to users.

2. Applicable Privacy Policy and other Policies

In addition to this Agreement, your access to and use of the Content and Service (including without limitation your submission of information through the App) is subject to Moomoo’s then-current policies relating to the Content and Service, including, without limitation, Moomoo’s Privacy Policy, located at “[Privacy Policy](https://help.moomoo.com/privacy/common)”. By using the App, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information by or on behalf of Moomoo as explained in Moomoo’s Privacy Policy. You represent and warrant that any information you provide in connection with the App is and will remain accurate and complete, and that you will maintain and update such information as needed. If you open an account with a broker-dealer and use the Service, you are consenting to have your personal information transferred/disclosed by Moomoo to, and processed by, your broker-dealer and its affiliates. Such consent will include your agreement that Moomoo is entitled to rely on instructions, directions and other information provided to Moomoo by your broker-dealer on your behalf and Moomoo may provide to your broker-dealer any updates in your personal information as furnished by you to Moomoo. You may also use the Service to display on the App the status of your account at your broker-dealer. Your personal account information displayed on the App will be subject to Moomoo’s Privacy Policy, rather than your broker-dealer’s privacy policy. As part of the Service, your broker-dealer may communicate with you through the App. You may not be able to opt-out from receiving those communications.

3. Customer service

You further agree that and understand that if you contact Moomoo for customer support, Moomoo’s service representatives may access your personal information to confirm your identity and to provide services to you.

4. Jurisdictional Issues

The App is controlled or operated (or both) from the United States. This Agreement and your use of the Service will be governed by the laws of the United States, even if you are using the App in other jurisdictions. The App may not be appropriate or available for use in some non-U.S. jurisdictions. The services or products offered on the App are not available in any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so. Any use of the App is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in doing so. We may limit the App’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.

5. Financial Services

The App may include functionality that makes available certain financial services and other offerings by your broker-dealer that may require payment of applicable fees and may be subject to additional terms. You will be subject to a customer agreement or client services agreement between you and your broker-dealer, in addition to this Agreement. If any such additional terms conflict with the terms of this Agreement, then such additional terms will govern with respect to the applicable service provided by the broker-dealer.

6. Market Data

You agree to be bound by the provisions provided in the Schedule to this Agreement (Market Data Information Provisions), which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference, with respect to market data.

You undertake and agree not to use all or any part of the market data information being displayed in the App or provided in the Service for the purpose of disseminating or transmitting any market data information to any person, or index computation and compilation, or deriving any tradable products, or any other purpose.

You agree and confirm, and by use of the market data, you have consented to your acceptance of the followings:

7. No Recommendations or Investment Advice

Moomoo is not an investment adviser or a broker-dealer. It does not provide investments or financial advice or offer securities for sale. Moomoo is currently available in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese languages. Moomoo allows licensed brokers-dealers in the US, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Singapore and Australia markets to offer their customers an intuitive platform for news, real-time market data and analytics, customizable tools, and communications service for securities trading. Moomoo also supports an interactive, social community for users to share their trading experiences, opinions and knowledge. Moomoo’s features can be explored by downloading the App and opening a Moomoo account with a valid email, phone number or acceptable social media account. To trade securities, Moomoo users must open a brokerage account at a licensed broker-dealer in an appropriate jurisdiction.

Please note that any Content provided through the Service (including any market data or other financial information available through the App) is made available for informational and educational purposes only, and is not intended to be a recommendation of any specific investment or investment strategy. In addition, please note that such Content may include Third Party Materials subject to the provisions of Section 14 of this Agreement. You are solely responsible for evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of any Content provided through the Service before making any decisions based on such Content. You agree not to hold Moomoo liable for any possible claim for damages arising from any decision you make based on the Content or other information made available to you through the Service or any third-party websites. Past performance data should not be construed as indicative of future results.

8. Rules of Conduct

In connection with the App, you must comply with the “[Moo Community Standards](https://help.moomoo.com/us/support/topic3_260?lang=en-us&from_platform=4&platform_langArea=us%2Fhans)”, as amended from time to time, and must not:

• Post, transmit or otherwise make available through or in connection with the App any materials that are or may be: (a) threatening, harassing, degrading, hateful or intimidating, or otherwise failing to respect the rights and dignity of others; (b) defamatory, libelous, fraudulent or otherwise tortious; (c) obscene, indecent, pornographic or otherwise objectionable; (d) protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity or privacy or any other proprietary right, without the express prior written consent of the applicable owner; or (e) a virus, worm, Trojan horse, Easter egg, time bomb, spyware or other computer code, file or program that is potentially harmful or invasive or intended to damage or hijack the operation of, or to monitor the use of, any hardware, software or equipment (each, a “Virus”).

• Use the App for any purpose other than for a purpose expressly provided under this Agreement or which is otherwise fraudulent or unlawful or commercial.

• Harvest or collect information about users of the App; restrict or inhibit any other person from using the App; interfere with or disrupt the operation of the App or the servers or networks used to make the App available, including by hacking or defacing any portion of the App; or violate any requirement, procedure or policy of any such server or network.

You are responsible for obtaining, maintaining and paying for all hardware and all telecommunications and other services needed to use the App.

9. Registration; User Names and Passwords

You may need to register to use all or part of the App. We may reject, or require that you change, any user name, password or other information that you provide to us in registering. You represent and warrant that any information you provide in connection with any such registration is and will remain accurate and complete, and that you will maintain and update such information as needed.

Your user name and password are for your personal use only and must be kept confidential; you, and not Moomoo, are responsible for any use or misuse of your user name or password, and you must promptly notify us of any confidentiality breach or unauthorized use of your user name or password, or your App account. If your device permits the use of facial recognition, unique gestures or other security measures, the App may enable you to use those security measures in addition to, or in place of, a user name or password.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES ARE MADE AVAILABLE BY A THIRD PARTY (WHICH MAY INCLUDE A MOBILE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDER) AND NOT BY US. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES, OR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT THAT RESULTS FROM ANY SUCH FAILURE. SUCH SECURITY MEASURES CONSTITUTE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS (AS DEFINED BELOW). YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF YOUR APP ACCOUNT AND ANY DEVICE ON WHICH THE APP IS INSTALLED.

10. Profiles and Forums

App users may make available certain materials (each, a “User Submission”) through or in connection with the App, including on blogs or profile pages or on the App’s interactive services, such as podcasts, message boards and other forums, and chatting, commenting and other messaging functionality (each, a “Forum”). All communications or other User Submissions made on or through the Forums are public. Moomoo has no control over and is not responsible for any use or misuse (including any distribution) by any third party of User Submissions. IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHER INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APP, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

11. License to User Submissions

The moomoo app is an online trading platform offered by Moomoo Technologies Inc. Securities, brokerage products and related services available through the moomoo app are offered by including but not limited to the following brokerage firms: Moomoo Financial Inc. regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Moomoo Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd. regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Futu Securities International (Hong Kong) Limited regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC), Moomoo Financial Canada Inc. regulated by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and Moomoo Securities Australia Ltd regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).

For further information about Moomoo Financial Inc., please visit [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)’s BrokerCheck](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/283078). Brokerage accounts with Moomoo Financial Inc. are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Moomoo Financial Inc. is a member of Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims for cash). It is important to understand that SIPC protects customer accounts against losses caused by the financial failure of the broker-dealer, but not against an increase or decrease in the market value of securities in customers' accounts. SIPC does not protect against market risk, which is the risk inherent in a fluctuating market. For further information about SIPC coverage for accounts with Moomoo Financial Inc., see [www.sipc.org](https://www.sipc.org/) or request an explanatory brochure from Moomoo Financial Inc.

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all customers. It is important that investors read [Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options](https://j.us.moomoo.com/017Phl) before engaging in any options trading strategies. Options transactions are often complex and may involve the potential of losing the entire investment in a relatively short period of time. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk, including the potential for losses that may exceed the original investment amount. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.

Investments in stocks, options, ETFs and other instruments are subject to risks, including possible loss of the amount invested. The value of investments may fluctuate and as a result, clients may lose the value of their investment. Past performance should not be viewed as an indicator of future results.

Margin trading involves interest charges and heightened risks, including the potential to lose more than invested funds or the need to deposit additional collateral. Before trading on margin, customers are advised to determine whether this type of trading is appropriate for them in light of their respective investment objective, experience, risk tolerance and financial situation.

Free trading refers to $0 commissions for Moomoo Financial Inc. self-directed individual cash or margin brokerage accounts of U.S. residents that trade U.S. listed securities via mobile devices or Web.
