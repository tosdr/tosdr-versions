Moomoo Technologies Inc. – Terms of Use
---------------------------------------

Last updated: August 14, 2024

Please read these Terms of Use (the “Agreement”) carefully. By downloading or using the App (as defined below), or otherwise indicating your agreement, you are consenting to this Agreement, including the associated schedules and policies referred to herein. At all times herein, “we” or “us” or “our” refers to Moomoo Technologies Inc. and “you” or "your” or “user” refers to the user who has opened an account with Moomoo Technologies Inc.

This Agreement is between you and Moomoo Technologies Inc. (“Moomoo”) concerning your use of (including any access to) our website(s), mobile and desktop applications known as “moomoo”, [https://www.moomoo.com](https://help.moomoo.com/), and any other Moomoo website or mobile application that posts a link to this Agreement (collectively, the “App”). You acknowledge that, through the App, Moomoo provides information and materials (collectively, the “Content”) and communications services (“Service”) that you may utilize to engage in self-directed securities trading through a brokerage account with an appropriately registered broker-dealer that has licensed the App for use by its customers (“broker-dealer”). The Content includes, without limitation, the Market Data discussed in Section 5 of this Agreement and the User Submissions discussed in Section 9 of this Agreement. You acknowledge that (a) Moomoo is not a broker-dealer; (b) Moomoo does not provide investment advice or make investment recommendations; (c) if you want to trade securities, you must open an account with a broker-dealer; (d) Moomoo does not make any recommendations with respect to your choice of a broker-dealer; (e) you are responsible for conducting your own review in selecting a broker-dealer of your choosing; and (f) if you open an account with a broker-dealer, your relationship with that broker-dealer will be governed by a customer services agreement between you and the broker-dealer.

YOU HEREBY AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OF THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU RESIDE AND CAPABLE OF FORMING A BINDING CONTRACT UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

This Agreement hereby incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions posted by Moomoo through the App, or otherwise made available to you by Moomoo. This Agreement is separate from any agreements that you may enter into with your broker-dealer, including any customer or account agreements and any other agreements that govern your use of software, products, goods, services, content, tools, and information provided by your broker-dealer.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 19 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.

1. Changes to this Agreement

We may revise this Agreement from time to time by updating this document. The most updated version of this Agreement will be made available for your review by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised Agreement under a link in the App or otherwise through the App (but no changes will apply to any dispute that previously arose between you and us).

You agree to review this Agreement periodically for changes. Your use of the App after any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of the changes. We (and/or a third party, as applicable) may, at any time, modify or discontinue all or part of the App (including the Content provided by such third party), or charge, change or waive any fees required to use the App.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moomoo will notify users of any material change to this Agreement, such as Moomoo’s ability to terminate the agreement, payment terms, liability, indemnity, Moomoo’s obligations and/or any of the user’s obligations. Such notification in respect of material changes to this Agreement will be provided through emails, website banners, the App pop-ups and any other way that can get the message across successfully to users.

2. Applicable Privacy Policy and other Policies

In addition to this Agreement, your access to and use of the Content and Service (including without limitation your submission of information through the App) is subject to Moomoo’s then-current policies relating to the Content and Service, including, without limitation, Moomoo’s Privacy Policy, located at “[Privacy Policy](https://help.moomoo.com/privacy/common)”. By using the App, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information by or on behalf of Moomoo as explained in Moomoo’s Privacy Policy. You represent and warrant that any information you provide in connection with the App is and will remain accurate and complete, and that you will maintain and update such information as needed. If you open an account with a broker-dealer and use the Service, you are consenting to have your personal information transferred/disclosed by Moomoo to, and processed by, your broker-dealer and its affiliates. Such consent will include your agreement that Moomoo is entitled to rely on instructions, directions and other information provided to Moomoo by your broker-dealer on your behalf and Moomoo may provide to your broker-dealer any updates in your personal information as furnished by you to Moomoo. You may also use the Service to display on the App the status of your account at your broker-dealer. Your personal account information displayed on the App will be subject to Moomoo’s Privacy Policy, rather than your broker-dealer’s privacy policy. As part of the Service, your broker-dealer may communicate with you through the App. You may not be able to opt-out from receiving those communications.

3. Customer service

You further agree that and understand that if you contact Moomoo for customer support, Moomoo’s service representatives may access your personal information to confirm your identity and to provide services to you.

4. Jurisdictional Issues

The App is controlled or operated (or both) from the United States. This Agreement and your use of the Service will be governed by the laws of the United States, even if you are using the App in other jurisdictions. The App may not be appropriate or available for use in some non-U.S. jurisdictions. The services or products offered on the App are not available in any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so. Any use of the App is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in doing so. We may limit the App’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.

5. Financial Services

The App may include functionality that makes available certain financial services and other offerings by your broker-dealer that may require payment of applicable fees and may be subject to additional terms. You will be subject to a customer agreement or client services agreement between you and your broker-dealer, in addition to this Agreement. If any such additional terms conflict with the terms of this Agreement, then such additional terms will govern with respect to the applicable service provided by the broker-dealer.

6. Market Data

You agree to be bound by the provisions provided in the Schedule to this Agreement (Market Data Information Provisions), which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference, with respect to market data.

You undertake and agree not to use all or any part of the market data information being displayed in the App or provided in the Service for the purpose of disseminating or transmitting any market data information to any person, or index computation and compilation, or deriving any tradable products, or any other purpose.

You agree and confirm, and by use of the market data, you have consented to your acceptance of the followings:

7. No Recommendations or Investment Advice

Moomoo is not an investment adviser or a broker-dealer. It does not provide investments or financial advice or offer securities for sale. Moomoo is currently available in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese languages. Moomoo allows licensed brokers-dealers in the US, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Singapore and Australia markets to offer their customers an intuitive platform for news, real-time market data and analytics, customizable tools, and communications service for securities trading. Moomoo also supports an interactive, social community for users to share their trading experiences, opinions and knowledge. Moomoo’s features can be explored by downloading the App and opening a Moomoo account with a valid email, phone number or acceptable social media account. To trade securities, Moomoo users must open a brokerage account at a licensed broker-dealer in an appropriate jurisdiction.

Please note that any Content provided through the Service (including any market data or other financial information available through the App) is made available for informational and educational purposes only, and is not intended to be a recommendation of any specific investment or investment strategy. In addition, please note that such Content may include Third Party Materials subject to the provisions of Section 14 of this Agreement. You are solely responsible for evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of any Content provided through the Service before making any decisions based on such Content. You agree not to hold Moomoo liable for any possible claim for damages arising from any decision you make based on the Content or other information made available to you through the Service or any third-party websites. Past performance data should not be construed as indicative of future results.

If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding.
