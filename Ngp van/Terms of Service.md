**2.5 Third-Party Products.** Third-Party Products are not under our control and, as such, are not considered part of our Solutions. Such Third-Party Products are provided as a convenience and the availability of a Third-Party Product does not constitute an endorsement by us of the same. We make no representation or warranty regarding any Third-Party Product, including its availability, security, or suitability for use with or in conjunction with our Platforms or the Customer Data. Any proprietary right or interest to any such Third-Party Product and any content provided therein belongs to that third-party provider subject to any right or license Customer may hold as to such Third-Party Product.

4.2 Suspension. Your or your Users’ access to or use of a Solution may be subject to suspension or otherwise denied if we reasonably determine that (a) you or any User has violated, are violating, or intend to violate any of the provisions contained in Section 1.8 (Customer Responsibilities) of this Agreement; (b) you have ceased to continue your business in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding; (c) you are delinquent in your payment of Fees; or (d) the continued provision of a Solution to you or any User is prohibited by applicable law. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (x) provide you with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such Suspension; (y) where practicable limit the Suspension based on the circumstances leading to the Suspension (_e.g.,_ to certain Users), and (z) provide updates regarding resumption of access following any Suspension and resume such access as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the Suspension is cured. We will have no liability to you, your Affiliates, or Users for any losses, damages, or any other consequences that may result because of a Suspension**.**

4.4.2 Fee Adjustments at Renewal. As to the Platforms and other recurring Solutions, the Fees for any renewal Subscription Term will be at the then-current Fees as of the first day of the applicable Subscription Term or as reasonably determined by us but not to exceed an amount equal to a five percent (5%) annualized increase over the Fees charged for such Solutions on the last day of the just-ended Subscription Term.

4.4.3 Payment. Payment of Fees will be made in accordance with the applicable Order Form. On any outstanding Fees, we may impose interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law and will be entitled to recover from you all costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in collecting any overdue payment or interest.  
4.4.4 Payment Disputes. We will not exercise our rights under Section 4.1.3 (Termination) or Section 4.2 (Suspension) with respect to non-payment by Customer if Customer is disputing the applicable Fees reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within thirty (30) days, each party will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any terms that would limit remedies on account of a dispute. For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full.

Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder including without limitation all use or access of the Solutions by its Users. If we have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this Section 4.4.5, we will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Taxes will not be deducted from payments to us, except as required by applicable law, in which case Customer will increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, NGP VAN receives and retains (free from any liability for Taxes) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.

**5.1 Procedure****.** The party seeking indemnification hereunder (“**Indemnified Party**”): (a) will promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the “**Indemnifying Party**”) in writing of any third-party claim, demand, lawsuit, notice of violation, or proceeding (collectively, a “**Claim**”); provided, however, that the failure to give such prompt notice of a Claim will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure, (b) will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection with the Indemnifying Party’s activities hereunder, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, and (c) may, at its own expense, participate in the defense of a Claim. An Indemnifying Party will have the sole and exclusive authority to defend or settle any such Claim; however, neither the Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnified Party may settle any Claim under this Agreement where such settlement includes: (x) admitting liability or fault on behalf of the other party or (y) creating any obligation or imposes an act or forbearance (including injunctive or other equitable relief) on the other party, without the other party’s prior written consent.

**5.2 NGP VAN Indemnification****.** We will defend you and your officers, directors, employees, successors, and permitted assigns (each, a “**Customer Indemnitee**”) against a Claim (other than a Claim brought by an Affiliate of a Customer Indemnitee) (a “**Customer Indemnity Claim**”) arising out of or relating to an allegation that your use of the Platforms in accordance with this Agreement infringes or misappropriates a third-party's United States’ intellectual property rights and we will indemnify you from and against any damages, judgments, settlements, interest, fines, penalties, fines, or awards (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from such Claim. If NGP VAN receives information about such a Claim, we may in our discretion and at no cost to you: (a) procure for you the right to continue to use the affected Platforms under this Agreement, (b) modify or replace the allegedly infringing Platforms so that it no longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent, or (c) terminate the allegedly infringing Platforms and refund the Fees paid in respect of such Platforms for the remainder of the relevant Subscription Term starting with the date Customer lost use of the Platforms due to the Claim. The above indemnification obligation does not apply if you: (x) use of the Platforms in combination with data, software, applications, hardware, equipment, products, services, or other technology where the Platforms would not by themselves, and without modification, be infringing or (y) fail to use the Platforms in accordance with the then-applicable Documentation. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH CUSTOMER INDEMNITEE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND NGP VAN’S SOLE LIABILITY AND ENTIRE OBLIGATION FOR ANY CLAIM ALLEGING THAT THE PLATFORMS INFRINGE, MISAPPROPRIATE, OR OTHERWISE VIOLATE ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

**5.3 Customer Indemnification****.** Customer will defend NGP VAN and its officers, directors, employees, successors, and assigns (each, an “**NGP VAN Indemnitee**”) against a Claim (other than a Claim brought by an Affiliate of an NGP VAN Indemnitee) (an “**NGP VAN Indemnity Claim**”) arising out of or relating to any Customer Data or Customer Materials used in connection with the Solutions and you will indemnify us from and against any damages, judgments, settlements, interest, fines, penalties, fines, or awards (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from such Claim.

**6.4.3 Applicability.** YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT: (A) THIS SECTION 6.4 WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE AND WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING SECTION 6.4) (I) WILL APPLY EVEN IF A NON-BREACHING PARTY'S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (II) WERE RELIED ON BY THE PARTIES IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT; (III) REFLECT AN ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES (INCLUDING THE RISK THAT A CONTRACT REMEDY MAY FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND CAUSE CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS), AND (IV) FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES; (C) (I) THE CAPS WILL NOT BE CUMULATIVE; (II) IN NO EVENT WILL OUR (OR OUR AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE FOR THE SAME EVENT UNDER BOTH THE GENERAL LIABILITY CAP AND THE DATA PROTECTION CLAIMS CAP; AND (III) IF YOU (AND/OR YOUR AFFILIATES) HAS ONE OR MORE CLAIMS SUBJECT TO EACH OF THOSE CAPS, THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE WILL NOT EXCEED THE DATA PROTECTION CLAIMS CAP; AND (D) THE APPLICABLE MONETARY CAPS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6.4 WILL APPLY ACROSS THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY AND ALL SEPARATE AGREEMENT(S) ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS.

### **7\. MISCELLANEOUS**.

**7.1 Amendment.** Unless you have a separately negotiated and signed agreement stating otherwise, we may modify this Agreement by posting a revised version at [https://www.ngpvan.com/terms-of-service](https://www.ngpvan.com/terms-of-service/) and such revised version will become effective as to your use of the Solutions as of the next business day following its posting. Prior to such posting, we will provide you with notice of any material revision by contacting your designated administrator(s) at the contact information provided in the Platform. If you do not agree with a material modification to this Agreement, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days after we send notice of the revision. If you give us this notice, then your subscription will continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the Agreement prior to modification until your next renewal date, after which the current terms posted at [https://www.ngpvan.com/terms-of-service](https://www.ngpvan.com/terms-of-service/) will apply. However, if we can no longer reasonably provide the Solutions to you under the terms prior to modification (for example, if the modifications are required by law or result from general product changes), then the Agreement and/or affected Solutions will terminate upon our notice to you and we will promptly refund any prepaid but unused fees covering use of the Solutions after termination.

**7.2 Waiver.** No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving, including any time of the essence provisions as to a party’s obligations. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a) no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof and (b) no single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.  
**7.3 Interpretation; Entire Agreement****.** The parties intend that the construing of this Agreement is without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the statements made in the body of this Agreement or an Order Form, unless such inconsistency is expressly acknowledged as intended in a document, the following order of precedence governs: (a) first, this Agreement, and (b) second, the Order Form (but only as to that order).

7.4 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

**7.5 Electronic Signatures.** Each party intends and agrees that the electronic signatures, whether digital or encrypted, of the parties included in an Order Form will authenticate this Agreement and Order Form and will have the same force and effect as manual signatures. An electronic signature means any electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed and adopted by a party with the intent to sign such record.

**7.6 Relationship of the Parties****.** The relationship between you and us is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement creates any agency, partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither you nor us will have authority to contract for or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.

**7.7 No** **Third****\-****Party****Beneficiaries****.** Neither you nor we confer any right or remedy upon any party other than the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns. However, our respective “indemnitees” as defined in Section 5 are intended as third-party beneficiaries solely to extent of having the right to enforce any indemnity rights they may have under Section 5.

**7.8 Efforts.** We will exercise reasonable efforts in meeting our obligations under this Agreement and in providing the Solutions. For purposes of meeting our obligations, reasonable efforts will mean the undertaking of ordinary and reasonable measures that a prudent business under similar circumstances desiring to provide equivalent products and services would use to provide such products and services knowing that such exercise of such efforts does not guarantee achieving the particular result. Such reasonable efforts do not require us to take every conceivable measure or to take any measures that sacrifice our own economic and business interests (_e.g.,_ incur substantial losses to perform, insolvency) or suffer any unreasonable and disproportionate detriment to our expected benefits under this Agreement.

**7.9 Notices****.** All notices, requests, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications to a party (each, a “**Notice**”) must be in writing, addressed to the intended recipient at the address set forth on the most recent Order Form, and sent by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid).  
**7.10 Force Majeure****.** In no event will we be liable to you, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing our obligations under this Agreement, if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any of the following events (each a “**Force Majeure Event**”): flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, pandemic, war, terrorism, cyber terrorism or other comparable criminal or willful acts (including third-party hackers or other third-party malicious acts), invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns, our suppliers failure to supply necessary goods or services to us, passage of applicable law, any action taken by a government authority or other public authority (such as imposing an embargo), or international, national, or regional shortage of adequate power, telecommunications capacity, or transportation. In allocating the risk of delay or failure of performance of a party’s respective obligations under this Agreement, the parties have not considered the possible occurrence of any of the events listed herein or any similar or dissimilar events beyond their control, irrespective of whether such listed, similar or dissimilar events were foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement.

**7.11 Assignment** **and Delegation****.** Neither party will assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, we may assign our rights or delegate our obligations, in whole or in part and without such consent, to an entity that acquires all or substantially all of our business or assets, whether by merger, reorganization, acquisition, sale, or otherwise. Any assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 7.11 will be invalid. No assignmentor delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating party of any of its obligations hereunder unless the non-assigning or non-delegating party agree to a novation releasing the assigning or delegating party of its obligation under this Agreement.

**7.12 Governing Law****.** This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the District of Columbia without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the District of Columbia. Any Action arising out of or related to this Agreement or its subject matter will be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the District of Columbia, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN.

**7.13 Contract for Services.** This Agreement is a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any similar legislation as may be enacted, will not apply to this Agreement. If you are located outside of the territory of the United States, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not govern this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

**7.14 Actions Permitted.** Except for actions for nonpayment of Fees or breach of a party’s proprietary rights, no action, regardless of form, arising directly or indirectly out of this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action accrued.

**7.15 Dispute Resolution**. Each party agrees that before it seeks any form of legal relief (except for a provisional remedy as explicitly set forth below) it will provide written notice to the other party of the specific issue(s) in dispute (and reference the relevant provisions of this Agreement at issue). Within thirty (30) days after such notice, knowledgeable executives of the parties shall hold at least one meeting (in person or by video- or tele-conference) for the purpose of attempting in good faith, to resolve the dispute. The parties agree to maintain the confidential nature of all disputes and disagreements between them, including, but not limited to, informal negotiations, mediation or arbitration, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct these dispute resolution procedures or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. The dispute resolution procedures in this Section 7.15 will not apply to claims subject to indemnification under Section 5 (Indemnification) or prior to a party seeking a provisional remedy related to claims of misappropriation or ownership of intellectual property, trade secrets, or Confidential Information.

**7.16 Export Controls; Government Terms.** Customer will not download or otherwise export or re-export the Solutions or underlying information or technology in violation of the laws and regulations of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions. We provide the Solutions, including related software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with this Agreement. If you (or any of your Users) are an agency, department, or other entity of any government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Solutions, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data, software, and manuals, is restricted by this Agreement. All other use is prohibited and no rights other than those provided in this Agreement are conferred. The Solutions were developed fully at private expense.
