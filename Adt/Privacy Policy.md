Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your country of residence.

ADT Inc. (and its affiliated entities) participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Frameworks, ADT Inc. is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

### 6\. Other Information

* ##### How ADT Limits Information Collection, Use, Disclosure, and Sharing:
    

**o Data Minimization.** ADT uses best practices to limit the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of personal information.

**o Product Specific.** Certain ADT products and services may require the collection of personal information from individuals that are less than 13 years of age to use all features. For such situations where ADT does knowingly collect personal information from individuals that are less than 13 years of age, we make clear disclosures in the product or service and its associated privacy policy, we only collect such information with verifiable prior consent from a parent or legal guardian, and we allow the parent or legal guardian to review, delete, or withdraw such consent by contacting us. You can learn more about such products or services [here](https://www.adt.com/about-adt/legal/product-privacy-policy).

* ##### How ADT Processes Information on Behalf of our Clients:
    

**o Information Processing.** We may process personal information collected through our services on behalf of our clients. Such processing and use shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the client has engaged ADT. In situations where ADT collects information under the direction of its client, we may not have a direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information we collect or process. If you are a customer of one of our clients and are seeking to access, correct, delete, or exercise other privacy rights, you should direct your request to ADT’s client (the data controller), not ADT. ADT will respond appropriately and in compliance with applicable law to any instructions or requested actions received from our client (the data controller). We will retain the personal information we collect or process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our client, or as otherwise allowed under applicable law.

* ##### How ADT Uses Online Tracking/Opt-out:
    

**o Global Privacy Control/Do Not Track Signals.** ADT partners with third parties to display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third-party partners use cookies, web beacons, LSOs, tags, scripts, and similar technologies to gather information about you over time and across different websites or applications to help predict your preferences and show you interest-based advertisements. Our websites honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) opt-out preferences, but do not respond to browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

**o Opting-Out:** If you wish to opt-out of (i) interest-based advertising click [here](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) or if located in the European Union click [here](https://youronlinechoices.eu/) or (ii) cookies and other tracking technologies that share information about you with other third parties for advertising purposes, select “Manage Preferences" on our website cookie banner or enable GPC on your browser. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads and that changing your browser’s GPC settings, cookie preferences, or deleting your browser’s cookies and cache will reset your opt-out preferences. You may opt out of our marketing and promotional emails by using the “unsubscribe” link provided in the email.

* ##### How ADT Obtains Consent:
    

**o Obtaining Consent.** Each time you provide any personal information to us through our websites, products, services, or your devices, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of such information according to this policy. Consent for the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of such information may be obtained either expressly or implied. Your express consent may be given in writing, verbally, or electronically. Your implied consent may be given through actions you take, such as supplying personal information for a specified purpose. If you do not notify us, we will consider you to have consented to our continued collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of personal information. Revoking consent to collect, use, disclose, and share information for certain purposes may affect our ability to provide you with our products and services.

* ##### How ADT Uses Third Party References:
    

**o Third Party Websites/Links.** Our websites, products, and services may include links to third-party websites and use third-party services. If you submit personal information to any third-party websites or service providers, your information is governed by their privacy policies. This policy does not address the privacy practices of any third-party websites or service providers. You must review any applicable third-party privacy policy for more information on their privacy practices.
