4\. Account.

**  

In order to use some of the App features you may have to create or use an account ("**Account**"). If you create an Account, you must provide accurate and complete information in connection with your Account. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs in your Account, and you must keep your Account password secure. You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. As between you and the Company, you are solely responsible and liable for the activity that occurs in connection with your Account.

  
**

5\. Special Features

**  

The App may provide additional and special features, including, without limitation the following ones. For avoidance of doubt, the Company is not liable in case of discontinue of any specific feature.

  

* **Caller ID**: The "Caller ID" feature allows you to associate a name with a phone number, whether automatically in an incoming call or manually by a numeric search.
* **Name Tag**: You may tag a name to a phone number using our "Name Tag" feature. When a sufficient number of users indicated that the phone number is associated with the same name, the name and phone number will be included in our directory.
* **Call Block**: You may also report a phone number as SPAM in our directory and block future attempts to contact you from that phone number using our "Call Block" feature. If you decide to block a phone number, the caller will be directed to your voicemail when attempting to contact you. You may also report any number to our SPAM public directory. When a sufficient number of users report a phone number as SPAM, it will be listed in our searchable public directory, which will be periodically updated. You may always withdraw your SPAM report or block request.
* **Sync.ME Search**: To access or use our "Sync.ME Search" feature you will be required to provide your contacts' names, phone numbers and email addresses for the Service's phonebook directory; this will enhance the performance of the Service and allow you to perform numeric search or identify incoming calls against a searchable phonebook directory, which contains the contacts' information from our users who permitted the aggregation of this information. If you chose to activate the "Sync.ME Search" feature, you will be asked to explicitly warrant that you have all necessary permissions to share your contacts' information, and that you have no knowledge of any objection, on the behalf of any of your respected contacts, to include their names and phone numbers in the phonebook directory, which is available for other registered users. Please be sure not to share any other person's details without his or her prior consent, and that the information you share through our Sync.ME feature is accurate and up-to-date. For security reasons, we will also filter out numbers of your phonebook which do not seem to correlate to an actual person. You may at any time opt-out of this feature by deactivating it, in which case we will de-list your contacts (unless their details were provided by other sources).
* **Name Search**: Our "Name Search" feature will allow you to request a phone number at a manual name search; the request will only be accommodated it the searched person has made his phone number available for search via the Service, or where his phone number is available on a publicly accessible directory. If that is not the case, the request will be forwarded (by SMS) to the searched person (if permissible), who may choose whether to share with you his number at his or her own discretion, block future requests from you or opt-out of this feature altogether. Your profile information will be visible to that person. Any person may opt-out of this feature, free of charge, by contacting us at: [support@sync.me](mailto:support@sync.me). In any case, no person will receive more than two requests a week. You hereby consent that you may receive such requests, in accordance with the terms stipulated herein.
* **Social Network Sync**: Certain features of the App allow you to synchronize your profile information and your contacts' information with the information contained on your social networks and platforms (Facebook, Google+, VK, LinkedIn, etc.), including information made available by your contacts or friends on such social networks (e.g. birthdays, photos, status, etc.). These features will enhance the performance of our Service and allow you to better integrate and harmonize our Service with your updated profile information and information concerning your friends. The Company will abide by the terms and conditions of the social networks and platforms in which you and any relevant contact are registered with a profile, with respect to retrieving accessible information from such networks or platforms (for synchronization or for other purposes), and will follow any configuration, security, privacy or other applicable restrictions of such platforms.
