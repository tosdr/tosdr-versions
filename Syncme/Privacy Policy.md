Sync.Me Privacy Policy
======================

Last Revised: May 20, 2024

  

If you are resident in California please click [here](https://sync.me/privacy-ccpa).

  
  
  

**INTRODUCTION**

  

Sync.Me Technologies Ltd. ("**Sync.Me**", "**our**", "**we**", "**us**" or the "**Company**") is committed to respect the privacy and Personal Information of the users ("**user**" or "**you**") in connection with the use of our mobile application and/or by accessing our website [https://sync.me/](https://sync.me/) (collectively the "**Service**").

  

* Our Service is primarily designed to empower consumers to make informed decisions and deter illegal and fraudulent calling activities.
  
* Our Service plays a key role in enhancing connectivity and thwarting intrusive and fraudulent calls, by introducing a variety of smart features that empower consumers to make informed decisions and reduce the risks of the user community from being targeted by malicious or misleading activities. These features include:
      
    2. Reporting and blocking spam: our users can choose to report and block numbers to be added to their personal spam call list, and potentially a regional spam call list. In the event a particular number was reported as spam by a certain number of users, other users will be notified if they receive a call from that same number.
      
    4. Live Caller ID and Spam detection: our Live Caller ID displays the name of the caller before the consumer answers the call, and flags if the number was reported as spam.
      
    6. Number search (reverse lookup): individuals, including those who are not registered users with Sync.ME, may manually search a number on Sync.ME's web-based platform in order to ascertain the identity of the caller and whether a number was reported as spam. The contact information collected by Sync.ME is used solely to empower individuals to identify incoming calls from unknown sources, identify unknown numbers through the use of reverse numeric lookup, as well as to report and block fraudulent, intrusive or inappropriate calls.
      
    
  
* We designed our features to better respond to deceptive and abusive practices aided by anonymity, both in telemarketing as well as in other abusive or deceptive practices (such as abusive calls).
  
* Our goal is to promote consumer privacy by allowing them to know who is calling them, as well as to promote accountability throughout the industry.
  
* Important note: Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit in any way your statutory rights, including your rights to a remedy or means of enforcement.
  
* How to withdraw consent? If you would like to remove your Personal Information from our Service, you may do so by visiting this link: [https://sync.me/unsubscribe](https://sync.me/unsubscribe/).
  
* Please read our CCPA privacy policy here [https://sync.me/privacy-ccpa](https://sync.me/privacy-ccpa)

By enabling this tool, we enable the collection of data about App Users, including via identifiers for mobile devices (including Android Advertising ID and Advertising Identifier for iOS), cookies and similar technologies. We use the information we get from Google Analytics for Firebase to maintain and improve our App(s). We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information unless we have robust notice of, and your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger. Finally, please note that Google Analytics for Firebase's terms (available at [https://firebase.google.com/terms/](https://firebase.google.com/terms/)) shall also apply.

AppsFlyer's terms of use (available at [https://www.appsflyer.com/terms-of-use/](https://www.appsflyer.com/terms-of-use/)) and privacy policy (available at [https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/](https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/)) also apply to the use of AppsFlyer.

We also combine and share such information and other information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) with third party advertising partners. These advertising partners will use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third party websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising. We allow access to other data collected by the services to share information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.
