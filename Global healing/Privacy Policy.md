### Cookies

When you visit websites from your computer, the web servers utilized by those websites create small packets of information regarding your visit to the website. These small packets of information are known as “Cookies.” The websites you visit use these cookies to monitor your activity while visiting the website, such as which pages you visited and which links you accessed, and to record information about you. With this information, the websites can provide customized features to you in the event you return, thereby enhancing your experience with those websites.

There are two different types of cookies utilized by websites. The first is what is known as a “session” cookie. A session cookie temporarily records a small amount of information in your internet browser’s memory, but this information expires and is destroyed when you close your internet browser. The second type of cookie is known as a “persistent” cookie. Persistent cookies save the small amount of information created by your visit to a website to your computer’s hard drive and, in the event you revisit a website, your computer accesses the persistent cookie. Persistent cookies allow a website to understand what your interests were the last time you visited the website, and uses that information to enhance your experience with the website.

We use session and persistent cookies on our Website to enhance our users’ experience with [https://globalhealing.com](https://globalhealing.com/). By doing this, we are able to offer specific promotions or company information to you based on your previous orders and interests with Global Healing. For example, if you were interested in a specific product we offer, we could use your information from your visit to our Website to send you a special offer for that product or invite you to try a related product you may have been interested in but were unaware that we also offer. Our goal is that by using this information, we can optimize your experience with our Website by catering to your interests. We also want to use this information to help us make improvements to our Website where necessary. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser’s preferences by following its instructions. If you choose to disable cookies you may still browse our Website, but many of the features will not work.

We may also use these cookies to serve you relevant ads on Google. To opt-out of these ads, please see the information here: [https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en) and here: [https://steelhouse.com/opt-out/](https://steelhouse.com/opt-out/)

### Children’s Personal Data

Although Global Healing does not specifically market to children under the age of thirteen (13), we care and are concerned with the privacy of child web users. Thus, Global Healing intends on fully complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and all provisions and regulations prescribed by COPPA, as well as California’s Online Eraser Law, and the Delaware Online Privacy and Protection Act (“DOPPA”).

Global Healing does not knowingly contact, solicit, record, or collect personal information from children under the age of 13 in the U.S., under the age of 18 in California and Delaware, and under the age of 16 in the EU and, in the event we discover that we have been defrauded or deceived into collecting such information, we will either immediately use that information to obtain parental consent or completely destroy the information collected.

Parents have the right to review the personal data that we may have collected about their children. Parents can, at any time, refuse to permit us to collect any more personal data about their children, and can request that we delete from our records all of the personal data that we have collected about their children. Parents should keep in mind that a request to delete such information about their children means that their children will not be able to utilize our Website. In order to request access to, change, or delete their child’s personal data, parents can send an email to us at [\[email protected\]](https://globalhealing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). It will be necessary for you to authenticate yourself as the child’s parent to receive any information about that child. A valid request to delete personal data will be undertaken within a reasonable period of time.
