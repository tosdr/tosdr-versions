14. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
    
    **PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**
    
    Any dispute arising out of these Terms shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual; and an arbitrator must also follow the terms of these Terms, as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability and the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. Arbitration shall take place in Houston, Texas, unless Global Healing elects otherwise.
    
    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Global Healing will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Global Healing should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration and Global Healing will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, Global Healing will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Global Healing for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Global Healing on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply.
    
    You can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and the email address used to log in to the Global Healing account to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.
    
    _Class Action Waiver._ YOU AND GLOBAL HEALING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. This means that you and Global Healing expressly waive any rights to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
    
    _Survival._ This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the website.
    
15. NOTICES
    
    Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices shall be given by postal mail to Global Healing, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1242 N Post Oak Rd, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77055 (in the case of Global Healing) or to the address you provide to Global Healing during the purchase process (in your case). Notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing.
    
16. MISCELLANEOUS
    
    These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Global Healing and govern your use of the website, services and any transactions you may have with Global Healing through the website and completely replaces and supersedes any prior agreements or understanding, arrangements, undertaking or proposal, written or oral, between you and Global Healing in relation to such matters. In the event any other rule, code of conduct, or other matter posted on the website conflicts with the terms of these Terms, these Terms of Use shall govern. The website is controlled and operated from within the United States.

Those who choose to access the website from other locations do so on their own volition and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.
    
    This Agreement may not be otherwise amended except in writing signed by you and Global Healing, Inc. This Agreement is subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Texas, with the exception of its conflict of laws provisions. Any waiver or forbearance by Global Healing of any breach (by Customer) of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by Customer. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their executors, administrators, successors, and assigns. If any provision of this Agreement is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability will not affect any other provision hereof. Such provision and the remainder of this Agreement and schedules shall, in such circumstances, be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render the remaining provisions enforceable.

    4. Dispute Resolution
        
        * General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Global Healing in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Global Healing agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these SMS terms and conditions ("SMS Terms") or your receipt of text messages from Global Healing or its service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these SMS Terms, or your receipt of text messages from Global Healing or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE SMS TERMS, YOU AND GLOBAL HEALING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE SMS TERMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.
            
        * Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, nothing in these SMS Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or Global Healing to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
            
        * Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Global Healing will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these SMS Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Global Healing. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
            
        * Notice; Process. If you or Global Healing intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). Global Healing address for Notice is: 1242 N Post Oak RD Suite 100, Houston, TX 77055, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and Global Healing will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Global Healing do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Global Healing may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Global Healing must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. (e) Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these SMS Terms, Global Healing will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Global Healing for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and Global Healing agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or Global Healing made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
            
        * No Class Actions. YOU AND GLOBAL HEALING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Global Healing agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
            
        * Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these SMS Terms, if Global Healing makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to the contact address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to [\[email protected\]](https://globalhealing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or to 1242 N Post Oak Rd Suite 100, Houston TX 7705, for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Global Healing.
            
        * Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of subsection (f) above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these SMS Terms is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these SMS Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
