As a general principle, we only collect and use personal data from our users insofar as this is necessary for the provision of a well-functioning website and of our contents and services.

In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make the processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 Para. 1 Item d GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary for the safeguarding of a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 Para. 1 Item f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.

#### **2.3. Erasure of data and storage period**

The personal data of the data subject is erased or anonymised as soon as the purpose of the storage no longer applies. Storage beyond this period may occur if stipulated by the European or national legislators in regulations, laws or other provisions of Union law to which the data controller is subject. The anonymisation or erasure of the data also takes place when a storage term stipulated by the aforementioned norms expires, unless there is a necessity for the continued storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.

### **3\. Provision of the website**

#### **3.1. Description and scope of the data processing**

Each time our website is called up, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the querying computer.

#### **3.2. Legal basis for the data processing**

The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and log files is Art. 6 Para. 1 Item f GDPR.

#### **3.3. Purpose of the data processing**

The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary in order to enable the provision of the website to the user’s computer. To this end, the IP address of the user must be stored for the duration of the session.

The storage and analysis in log files takes place so as to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, this data helps us to optimise the website and ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.

These purposes also form the basis of our legitimate interest in the data processing according to Art. 6 Para. 1 Item f GDPR.

#### **3.4. Duration of the storage**

The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the achievement of the purpose for which it was collected. In the event that the data is recorded for the provision of the website, this is the case once the respective session is ended. In the event that the data is stored in log files, this is the case at the latest after fourteen days. Storage beyond this point is not possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or distorted such that association with the inquiring client is no longer possible.

#### **3.5. Option to object or request elimination**

The collection of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. Consequently, the user has no option to object.

There is an option to object with regard to the evaluation of the subpages and functions that the user calls up in the customer area, webmail or PHPMyAdmin tool, for the purpose of optimising the website (improvement of usability). A settings option in the customer area enables you to declare your objection in this respect:

We have integrated Wordfence into this website. The provider is Defiant Inc, Defiant, Inc, 800 5th Ave Ste 4100, Seattle, WA 98104, USA (hereinafter referred to as Wordfence).

Wordfence protects our website from unwanted access or malicious cyberattacks. To do this, our website establishes a permanent connection to Wordfence’s servers so that Wordfence can check its databases against the accesses made to our website and block them if necessary. The use of Wordfence is based on Article 6 Para. 1 (f) of the GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its website against cyberattacks as effectively as possible. The data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. You can find details here: [https://www.wordfence.com/help/general-data-protection-regulation/](https://www.wordfence.com/help/general-data-protection-regulation/) .

We have concluded an order processing contract with Wordfence. This is a contract required by data protection law and ensures that Wordfence processes the personal data of our website visitors strictly in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.

In exceptional cases, from which website users are usually not affected, Wordfence uses cookies. Below, we explain what each cookie does, which users the cookie is set for and how the cookie helps protect the site.

(1) wfwaf-authcookie- (Hash): This cookie is used by the Wordfence firewall to carry out a capability check on the current user before WordPress loads. It’s only set for users who can log into WordPress. The Wordfence firewall uses this cookie to recognise logged-in users and allow them increased access. Wordfence can also detect users who are not logged in and restrict their access to secure areas. The cookie informs the firewall what level of access a visitor has, so that the firewall can make informed decisions about who should be allowed and who should be blocked.

(2) wf\_loginalerted\_ (Hash): This cookie is used to notify the Wordfence administrator when an administrator logs in from a new device or location. This cookie is set for administrators only and is used to help site operators know if an admin has logged in from a new device or location.

(3) wfCBLBypass: Wordfence offers a site visitor the option of bypassing country blocking by accessing a hidden URL. This cookie can be used to track who can bypass country blocking. When a hidden URL defined by the site administrator is accessed, this cookie is used to check whether the user can access the site from a country restricted by country blocking. This is set for anyone who knows the URL that enables the default country blocking to be bypassed. This cookie is not set for anyone who does not know the hidden URL to bypass country blocking. This cookie gives site owners the ability to allow certain users of blocked countries even though their country has been blocked.

### **11\. Web analysis by Google Analytics (Analysis cookies)**

#### **11.1. Scope of the processing of personal data**

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored on your computer and that enable the analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website (including your IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to assess your use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities for the website operators and to provide further services connected to the use of the website and the use of the internet. Google may potentially also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Under no circumstances will Google link your IP address to other data.

You can prevent the storage of the cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser software; furthermore, you can prevent the recording of the data generated by the cookie as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) . However, we must point out that in this case, you may not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent.

IP anonymisation: We use the function “activation of the IP anonymisation” on this website. This means that your IP address is first shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before it is transmitted to the USA and thus anonymised. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

By consenting to the use of analysis cookies, at the same time you agree pursuant to Art. 49 Para. 1 Item a GDPR that your data may be processed in the USA. The ECJ does not confirm an appropriate data protection level for the USA that matches the EU standards (ECJ, C-311/18, Schrems II), especially since your data may be processed by the US authorities for monitoring purposes without any effective legal protection being available against such measures.

More information on how Google Analytics handles user data is available in Google’s data privacy statement: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en) .

The legal basis for the processing of users' personal data is the consent of the person concerned in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Item f GDPR.

#### **11.3. Purpose of the data processing**

The processing of the personal data of the users enables us to analyse our users’ browsing habits. By evaluating the data obtained, we are able to compile information on the use of the individual components of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness.

#### **11.4. Duration of the storage**

The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for our record-keeping purposes. The evaluations are performed using aggregated, and thus no longer personal, data.

#### **11.5. Option to object or request elimination**

Cookies are stored on the user’s computer and transmitted to us from there. Hence you as the user have complete control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your internet browser, you can deactivate or limit the transmission of cookies. Cookies that have already been stored can be deleted at any time. This can also be carried out automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it is possible that you may no longer be able to use all the functions of the website to their full extent.

### **12\. Remarketing (Marketing Cookies)**

This website uses Google’s remarketing function. The function serves to present advertisements of interest to the website visitors within the Google advertising network. This technology enables us to display automatically created, target group-oriented advertisements after your visit to our website. The displays are based on the products and services that you clicked on during your last visit to our website. To this end, a so-called “cookie” is stored in the browser of the website visitor, which makes it possible to recognise the visitor when he calls up websites that belong to the Google advertising network. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your browser when you visit our website. Normally, Google stores information such as your web request, the IP address, the browser type, the browser language, the date and the time of your request. This information serves to associate the web browser with a specific computer. On the web pages of the Google advertising network, advertisements can subsequently be presented to the visitor that are related to contents that the visitor previously called up on websites that use Google’s remarketing function.

You as the user have the option to deactivate the use of cookies by Google; you can do so by calling up the page to deactivate Google at [https://www.google.com/ads/preferences](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences) . You can view more detailed information on Google remarketing as well as Google’s data privacy statement at: [https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/](https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/) .

By consenting to the use of marketing cookies, at the same time you agree pursuant to Art. 49 Para. 1 Item a GDPR that your data may be processed in the USA. The ECJ does not confirm an appropriate data protection level for the USA that matches the EU standards (ECJ, C-311/18, Schrems II), especially since your data may be processed by the US authorities for monitoring purposes without any effective legal protection being available against such measures.

On the website we use technologies from Bing Ads (bingads.microsoft.com), which are provided and operated by Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA ("Microsoft"). Microsoft places a cookie on your device if you have reached our website via a Microsoft Bing ad. In this way, Microsoft and we can recognize that someone has clicked on an ad, has been redirected to our website and has reached a previously determined target page ("conversion site"). We only find out the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then redirected to the conversion site. Microsoft collects, processes and uses information via the cookie, from which usage profiles are created using pseudonyms. These usage profiles are used to analyze visitor behavior and are used to display advertisements. No personal information about the identity of the user is processed. If you do not want information about your behavior from Microsoft to be used as explained above, you can refuse the setting of a cookie required for this - for example via a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies.

You can also prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website and the processing of this data by Microsoft by clicking on the following link [https://choice.microsoft.com/de-DE/opt-out](https://choice.microsoft.com/de-DE/opt-out) explain out your contradiction. Further information on data protection and the cookies used by Microsoft and Bing Ads can be found on the Microsoft website [https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement) .

If you do not change any settings or delete anything in your internet browser, the marketing cookies will remain valid for one month, with the exception of the following cookies, which remain valid for three months:

### **13\. Analysis by Jentis GmbH**

For the purpose of analysing the user behaviour of customers and for the purpose of website optimisation, we use services of JENTIS GmbH (Schönbrunner Strasse 231, 1120 Vienna, Austria). This service provider therefore receives access to web analysis data, which are measured, stored and made available by the utilised analysis tools and JENTIS®.

On the one hand, data is transmitted to JENTIS GmbH for analysis purposes, on the other hand JENTIS® on our behalf independently collects data relating to the browser environment or the behaviour of the visitor. JENTIS GmbH only processes data that JENTIS GmbH cannot trace back to a person. IDs set by JENTIS® are merely random products and are used for anonymous recognition. Your IP address will be shortened before storage so that no personal reference is required.

### **14\. LinkedIn Insight Conversion Tool**

We use the LinkedIn Insight Conversion Tool of LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, which allows us to obtain information about the use of our website and to provide you with advertising content on other websites that is tailored to your interests. For this purpose, a cookie with a validity of 120 days is set in your browser, which enables LinkedIn to recognize you when you visit a website. LinkedIn uses this data to create anonymous reports on ad activity and information about how you interact with our website.

You can disable the LinkedIn Insight Conversion Tool and interest-based advertising by opting out at the following link: [https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads](https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/categories/ads) .

By consenting to the use of marketing cookies, at the same time you agree pursuant to Art. 49 Para. 1 Item a GDPR that your data may be processed in the USA. The ECJ does not confirm an appropriate data protection level for the USA that matches the EU standards (ECJ, C-311/18, Schrems II), especially since your data may be processed by the US authorities for monitoring purposes without any effective legal protection being available against such measures.

### **15\. Personalization Engine**

In the customer area, in which you can log in as a customer of ours, we use the Personalization Engine tool from Ionos SE, Elgendorfer Str. 57, 56410 Montabaur, Germany (former name: "Ad Server"). This function is used to show you information and personalized offers in the customer area. For this purpose, your following data are transmitted to our service provider Ionos SE:  

* language
* customer number
* first name
* last name 
* company name
* date of your registration
* gender “unknown”
* telephone number 
* e-mail address
* address (street, number, ZIP-code, city, state)
* data of products/packages (product IDs, purchase date for the product/service, product definition ID, product description, product category)
* 2FA-authentication active/inactive

The legal basis for the processing of user's personal data is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The respective data will be deleted at the end of the session.

On the website, we use the Personalization Engine tool for web tracking of website users. For this purpose, the following data is transmitted to our service provider Ionos SE:

* Full URL accessed
* Title of the page accessed
* Scroll position

The legal basis for the processing of users' personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent). The respective data is deleted 365 days after the last visit.

### **16\. Reddit Pixel (Conversion Tracking)**

Purpose: Marketing  
Recipient country: USA

On our website we use the Reddit Conversion Pixel, an analysis service of Reddit Inc., 520 Third Street, Suite 305, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA ("Reddit").

Within the scope of this service, data is transmitted to the USA or such transmission cannot be ruled out. We would like to point out that, in the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of data protection in the case of data transfer to the USA and that there are therefore various risks (such as possible access by US secret services).

For this tool, a so-called tracking pixel is integrated on our website. When you visit our pages, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Reddit server via this tracking pixel. Reddit thereby receives, among other things, the information from your browser that our page was called up from your end device. We would like to point out that we have no influence on the scope of the transmitted data and its further use by Reddit and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of Reddit conversion pixels, Reddit receives the information that you have called up the corresponding web page of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Reddit service, Reddit can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Reddit or have not logged in, it is possible that the provider will find out and store your IP address and other identifying features.

The processing of your data is based on your consent within the meaning of Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future. 

You can find more information on data protection and your settings options in this regard at [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy)

### **17\. TikTok Pixel**

On our website, we use the so-called TikTok pixel of the social network TikTok, which is operated by TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland ("TikTok"). The parent company of TikTok is based in China.

**ATTENTION: Within the scope of this service, data transfer to China takes place or cannot be ruled out.**

With the help of the TikTok pixel, it is possible for TikTok, on the one hand, to determine you as a visitor to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called "TikTok ads"). Accordingly, we use the TikTok pixel to display the TikTok ads placed by us only to those TikTok users who have also shown an interest in our online offer or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of the websites visited) that we transmit to TikTok (so-called "Custom Audiences").

With the help of the TikTok pixel, we also want to ensure that our TikTok ads correspond to the potential interest of users and are not harassing. The TikTok pixel also allows us to track the effectiveness of the TikTok ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on a TikTok ad (so-called "conversion").

The processing of the data by TikTok takes place within the framework of the data use policy at [https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en of TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en%20of%20TikTok) .

Specific information and details about the TikTok Pixel and how it works can be found in the TikTok help section at [https://support.tiktok.com/en](https://support.tiktok.com/en)

The use of the TikTok pixel as well as the storage of "conversion cookies" is based on your consent according to Art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR. You can revoke this consent at any time.

For the processing of data for which TikTok acts as a data processor, we have concluded a data processing agreement with TikTok in which we oblige TikTok to protect our customers' data and not to pass it on to third parties.
