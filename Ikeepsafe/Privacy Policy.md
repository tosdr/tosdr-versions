Privacy Policy
--------------

The ikeepsafe.orgSM website, iKeepSafePrivacy.com and iKeepSafePrivacy.org are operated by the Internet Keep Safe CoalitionSM (IKSCSM) group.  The IKSCSM group comprises a partnership of governors, first spouses, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and corporate sponsors working to give parents, educators, and policymakers the information and tools which empower them to teach children the safe and healthy use of technology and the Internet.

It is our policy at the IKSCSM group to protect the privacy of those who visit our website. This policy explains what information we collect through the website and how we may use, disclose and share that information.  By using this site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  This policy may be updated as our organization changes.  When the policy changes, we will post a notice on our home page and at the top of this Privacy Policy page, and by any other means as required by law.  If you have any questions about this policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at [info@ikeepsafe.org](mailto:info@ikeepsafe.org).

**Collection of Personal Information**

In certain areas of our website we collect information from organizations and individuals who wish to participate in the Coalition.  For example, if you wish to receive a copy of a white paper, we may ask for your name, email address, school where employed (if applicable), and your role within the school.  We use this information to send you the information you’ve requested and to send you updates about topics that we believe might be of interest.  Schools requesting information about the Generation Safe materials are asked to provide a name, email address, school, school district, administrator type, stakeholder group, a user name and password.  The information is used to deliver the requested materials through the website, and to connect the user with others in their school who are also using Generation Safe materials.

We also collect information from individuals and organizations that reach us through the “Contact Us” section of the website, or that would like to schedule a media event with, or a presentation from, Faux Paw.

**Use of Personal Information**

We will use your Personal Information to provide you with additional materials and news about iKeepSafe and its programs that we believe may be of interest to you.  You may opt-out of receiving such information by contacting us at [info@ikeepsafe.org](mailto:info@ikeepsafe.org) or by selecting the “unsubscribe” link available in each email that we send.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

As a general policy, iKeepSafe does not sell, disclose or provide third-parties, including our third-party partners, with Personal Information about visitors to our website.  Personal Information, as used in this Privacy Policy, means last name, email address, street address, phone number, date-of-birth, and Social Security Number.  Personal Information excludes, however, Internet protocol address (“IP address”), cookies, device identifiers, geo-location, “URL’s” for web pages, and all other technical information.  Technical and other information is discussed below in the section entitled “Non-Personal Information.”

We delete user information periodically when it is no longer needed.
