(b) the Supplier is given a reasonable opportunity of examining such Digital Content.  
5.4 The Supplier shall not be liable for the Digital Content’s failure to comply with the warranty in clause 5.1 if:

(i) comply with any additional obligations as set out in the Specification.  
7.2 If the Supplier’s performance of any of its obligations under the Contract is prevented or delayed by any act or omission by the Customer or failure by the Customer to perform any relevant obligation (Customer Default):  
(a) without limiting or affecting any other right or remedy available to it, the Supplier shall have the right to suspend performance of the Services and delivery of the Digital Content until the Customer remedies the Customer Default, and to rely on the Customer Default to relieve it from the performance of any of its obligations in each case to the extent the Customer Default prevents or delays the Supplier’s performance of any of its obligations;  
(b) the Supplier shall not be liable for any costs or losses sustained or incurred by the Customer arising directly or indirectly from the Supplier’s failure or delay to perform any of its obligations as set out in this clause 7.2; and

8\. Charges and payment
-----------------------

8.1 In consideration for the provision of the Deliverables, the Customer shall pay the Supplier the Charges in accordance with this clause 8.  
8.2 The Supplier shall submit invoices for the Charges plus VAT if applicable to the Customer at the intervals specified in the Order Form.  
8.3 The Customer shall pay each invoice due and submitted to it by the Supplier, within 30 days of receipt, to a bank account nominated in writing by the Supplier and time for payment shall be of the essence of the Contract.  
8.4 If the Customer fails to make any payment due to the Supplier under the Contract by the due date for payment, then, without limiting the Supplier’s remedies under Clause 13 (Term and Termination):  
(a) the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue sum from the due date until payment of the overdue sum, whether before or after judgment. Interest under this clause will accrue each day at 4% a year above the Bank of England’s base rate from time to time, but at 4% a year for any period when that base rate is below 0%.  
(b) the Supplier may suspend all Services until payment has been made in full.  
8.5 All amounts due under the Contract from the Customer to the Supplier shall be paid by in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law).  
8.6 The Charges are based upon the estimated time requirements in the Order Form. Where the actual time required exceeds the estimated time required, the Supplier shall be at liberty to increase the Charges for each additional hour or part thereof in accordance with its then current tariff of charges.  
8.7 Where the Customer wishes to vary the scope of the Deliverables, the Customer shall email the Supplier Representative with details of the requested variation. The Supplier Representative will email the Customer Representative to confirm whether or not such variation is possible and if so, the related changes to the Charges for such variation. Any variation to the scope of the Deliverables and the Charges shall only be effective once recorded in writing and signed by both parties. Where the Supplier does not agree to the variation to the Deliverables or the Customer does not agree to the related variation to the Charges, the Customer shall be at liberty to terminate the Contract in accordance with clause 13.1(b).  
8.8 All amounts payable by the Customer under the Contract are exclusive of amounts in respect of value added tax chargeable from time to time (VAT). Where any taxable supply for VAT purposes is made under the Contract by the Supplier to the Customer, the Customer shall, on receipt of a valid VAT invoice from the Supplier, pay to the Supplier such additional amounts in respect of VAT as are chargeable on the supply of the Deliverables at the same time as payment is due for the supply of the Deliverables.  
8.9 In addition to the Charges the Supplier shall be at liberty to charge the Customer for expenses incurred by the Supplier in connection with the supply of the Deliverables including but not limited to: image or font purchases, Third Party Products, travel, accommodation and transportation costs.

9\. Intellectual property rights
--------------------------------

9.1 The Digital Content may be subject to Intellectual Property Rights belonging to third parties (Third Party IPR). The Supplier holds a non-exclusive licence of such Third Party IPR (a copy of such licence is available upon request). The Supplier grants to the Customer a non-exclusive licence to use the Third Party IPR solely as part of the Deliverables.  
9.2 All Intellectual Property Rights in or arising out of or in connection with the Services (other than Intellectual Property Rights in any Customer Materials) shall be owned by the Supplier. Unless and until the Intellectual Property Rights in the Digital Content have passed to the Customer in accordance with clause 9.1, the Supplier grants to the Customer a fully paid-up, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence during the term of the Contract to use and receive the Deliverables (excluding Customer Materials) in its business.  
9.3 The Customer shall not sub-license, assign or otherwise transfer the rights granted by clause 9.2.  
9.4 The Customer grants the Supplier a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty-free non-transferable licence to copy and modify any Customer Materials provided to the Supplier for the term of the Contract for the purpose of providing the Services to the Customer.  
9.5 The Customer grants the Supplier a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty-free non-transferable licence to copy and modify any Customer Materials provided to the Supplier for the term of the Contract and a period of three years beyond such term for the purpose of marketing the Supplier and its services.

10\. Data protection
--------------------

10.1 Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. This clause 10 is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party’s obligations or rights under the Data Protection Legislation. In this clause 10, Applicable Laws means (for so long as and to the extent that they apply to the Supplier) the law of the European Union, the law of any member state of the European Union and/or Domestic UK Law; and Domestic UK Law means the UK Data Protection Legislation and any other law that applies in the UK.  
10.2 The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation, the Customer is the controller and the Supplier is the processor.  
10.3 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 10.1, the Customer will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the personal data to the Supplier for the duration and purposes of the Contract.  
10.4 Without prejudice to the generality of clause 10.1, the Supplier shall, in relation to any personal data processed in connection with the performance by the Supplier of its obligations under the Contract:  
(a) process that personal data only on the documented written instructions of the Customer unless the Supplier is required by Applicable Laws to otherwise process that personal data. Where the Supplier is relying on Applicable Laws as the basis for processing personal data, the Supplier shall promptly notify the Customer of this before performing the processing required by the Applicable Laws unless those Applicable Laws prohibit the Supplier from so notifying the Customer;  
(b) ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures, reviewed and approved by the Customer, to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures (those measures may include, where appropriate, pseudonymising and encrypting personal data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its systems and services, ensuring that availability of and access to personal data can be restored in a timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures adopted by it);  
(c) ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process personal data are obliged to keep the personal data confidential; and  
(d) not transfer any personal data outside of the European Economic Area unless the prior written consent of the Customer has been obtained and the following conditions are fulfilled:  
(i) the Customer or the Supplier has provided appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer;  
(ii) the data subject (as defined in the Data Protection Legislation) has enforceable rights and effective legal remedies;  
(iii) the Supplier complies with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation by providing an adequate level of protection to any personal data that is transferred; and  
(iv) the Supplier complies with reasonable instructions notified to it in advance by the Customer with respect to the processing of the personal data;  
(e) assist the Customer, at the Customer’s cost, in responding to any request from a data subject and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;  
(f) notify the Customer without undue delay on becoming aware of a personal data breach;  
(g) at the written direction of the Customer, delete or return personal data and copies thereof to the Customer on termination of the Contract unless required by Applicable Law to store the personal data; and  
(h) maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with this clause 10 and immediately inform the Customer if, in the opinion of the Supplier, an instruction infringes the Data Protection Legislation.  
10.5 The Customer consents to the Supplier appointing third-party processors of personal data under the Contract. The Supplier confirms that it has entered or (as the case may be) will enter into written agreements with such third-party processors incorporating terms which are substantially similar to those set out in this clause 10 and in either case which the Supplier confirms reflect and will continue to reflect the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. As between the Customer and the Supplier, the Supplier shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of any third party processor appointed by it pursuant to this clause 10.  
10.6 Either party may, at any time on not less than 30 days’ notice, revise this clause 10 by replacing it with any applicable controller to processor standard clauses or similar terms forming part of an applicable certification scheme (which shall apply when replaced by attachment to the Contract).

11\. Confidentiality
--------------------

11.1 Each party undertakes that it shall not at any time during the Contract, and for a period of five years after termination of the Contract, disclose to any person any confidential information concerning the business, affairs, customers, clients or suppliers of the other party, except as permitted by clause 11.2.  
11.2 Each party may disclose the other party’s confidential information:  
(a) to its employees, officers, representatives, subcontractors or advisers who need to know such information for the purposes of carrying out the party’s obligations under the Contract. Each party shall ensure that its employees, officers, representatives, subcontractors or advisers to whom it discloses the other party’s confidential information comply with this clause 11; and  
(b) as may be required by law, a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental or regulatory authority.  
11.3 Neither party shall use the other party’s confidential information for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under the Contract.

12\. Limitation of liability
----------------------------

12.1 The restrictions on liability in this clause 12 apply to every liability arising under or in connection with the Contract including liability in contract, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise.  
12.2 Nothing in this clause 12 shall limit the Customer’s payment obligations under the Contract.  
12.3 Neither party may benefit from the limitations and exclusions set out in this clause in respect of any liability arising from its deliberate default.

(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and  
(c) breach of the terms implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 (title and quiet possession).  
12.5 Subject to clause 12.2 (No limitation on customer’s payment obligations) and clause 12.4 (Liabilities which cannot legally be limited), the Supplier’s total liability to the Customer for all loss or damage shall not exceed the Charges as set out in the Order Form.  
12.6 Any amounts awarded or agreed to be paid as refunds shall count towards the cap on the Supplier’s liability under clause 12.5.  
12.7 This clause 12.7 sets out specific heads of excluded loss:  
(a) The following types of loss are wholly excluded:  
(i) loss of profits;  
(ii) loss of sales or business;  
(iii) loss of agreements or contracts;  
(iv) loss of anticipated savings;

(viii) any loss arising out of or in connection with any Third Party Products contained within the Deliverables.  
12.8 Unless the Customer notifies the Supplier that it intends to make a claim in respect of an event within the notice period, the Supplier shall have no liability for that event. The notice period for an event shall start on the day on which the Customer became, or ought reasonably to have become, aware of the event having occurred and shall expire 4 weeks from that date. The notice must be in writing and must identify the event and the grounds for the claim in reasonable detail.  
12.9 This clause 12 shall survive termination of the Contract.

13\. Term and Termination

(a) the Customer giving to the Supplier not less than 5 Business Days’ written notice to terminate;  
(b) the Supplier giving to the Customer not less than 15 Business Days’ written notice to terminate; or  
(c) 45 days from Completion.  
13.2 Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either party may terminate the Contract with immediate effect by giving written notice to the other party if:

--------------------------------

14.1 On termination of the Contract:

(b) the Customer shall return all of the Supplier Materials and any Deliverables which have not been fully paid for. Until they have been returned, the Customer shall be solely responsible for their safe keeping and will not use them for any purpose not connected with this Contract.  
14.2 Termination or expiry of the Contract shall not affect any rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities of the parties that have accrued up to the date of termination or expiry, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Contract which existed at or before the date of termination or expiry.  
14.3 Any provision of the Contract that expressly or by implication is intended to have effect after termination or expiry shall continue in full force and effect.

15\. Force majeure
------------------

Neither party shall be in breach of the Contract nor liable for delay in performing or failure to perform, any of its obligations under the Contract if such delay or failure result from events, circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control (a Force Majeure Event).

16\. General
------------

16.1 Assignment and other dealings  
(a) The Supplier may at any time assign, mortgage, charge, subcontract, delegate, declare a trust over or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under the Contract.  
(b) The Customer shall not assign, transfer, mortgage, charge, subcontract, delegate, declare a trust over or deal in any other manner with any of its rights and obligations under the Contract without the prior written consent of the Supplier.  
16.2 Notices.  
(a) Any notice given to a party under or in connection with the Contract shall be in writing and shall be:  
(i) delivered by hand or by pre-paid first-class post or other next working day delivery service at its registered office (if a company) or its principal place of business (in any other case);  
(ii) sent by email to any named director of the Supplier; or  
(iii) sent by email to the Customer Representative.  
(b) Any notice shall be deemed to have been received:  
(i) if delivered by hand, on signature of a delivery receipt or at the time the notice is left at the proper address; and  
(ii) if sent by pre-paid first-class post or other next working day delivery service, at 9.00 am on the second Business Day after posting or at the time recorded by the delivery service; and  
(iii) if sent by email, at the time of transmission, or, if this time falls outside business hours in the place of receipt, when business hours resume. In this clause 16.2(b)(iii), business hours means 9.00am to 5.00pm Monday to Friday on a day that is not a public holiday in the place of receipt.  
(c) This clause 16.2 does not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action or, where applicable, any arbitration or other method of dispute resolution.  
16.3 Severance. If any provision or part-provision of the Contract is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause 16.3 shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of the Contract.  
16.4 Waiver. A waiver of any right or remedy under the Contract or by law is only effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent right or remedy. A failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under the Contract or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict any further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under the Contract or by law shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.  
16.5 No partnership or agency. Nothing in the Contract is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership or joint venture between the parties, constitute either party the agent of the other, or authorise either party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of the other party.  
16.6 Entire agreement.  
(a) The Contract constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between them, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.  
(b) Each party acknowledges that in entering into the Contract it does not rely on, and shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in the Contract. Each party agrees that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misrepresentation based on any statement in the Contract.  
(c) Nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.  
16.7 Third parties rights. Unless it expressly states otherwise, the Contract does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of the Contract.  
16.8 Variation. Except as set out in these Conditions, no variation of the Contract shall be effective unless it is agreed in writing and signed by the parties (or their authorised representatives).  
16.9 Governing law. The Contract and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.  
16.10 Jurisdiction. Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with the Contract or its subject matter or formation.
