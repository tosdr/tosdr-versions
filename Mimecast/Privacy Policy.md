This Privacy Statement describes how Mimecast uses and protects information about an identified or identifiable natural person (collectively, “Personal Data”) collected through the Site, offline communications, as well as at programs and events, and explains our marketing practices generally. This Privacy Statement is incorporated into, and is a part of, our Terms of Use, found [here](https://www.mimecast.com/legal/terms-of-use/), which governs your access to and use of the Site.

### What kind of technical data do we collect?

In addition to the Personal Data described above, we collect technical data and other information when you use our Services or visit our Site. You provide some of this Personal Data directly, such as when you register for a webinar, administer your organization’s Mimecast account, or contact us for support. We collect some of it by recording how you interact with our Site by, for example, using technologies like cookies or collecting basic device information like your browser type. We provide more information about cookies below.

#### Technical information collected automatically from the Site

When you visit the Site, our systems automatically collect the following information about your visit (“Other Data”):

* the type of internet browser you use;
* the language of your browser;
* the website from which you have come to the Site;
* the webpages you view on our Site; and
* the links you clicked on our Site;

We also collect your public IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet). This IP address is typically collected on a country or regional level. We collect your IP address to verify that requests are legitimate and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (identified collectively as “IP Information”). "Other Data" does not include IP Information.

As it is in our legitimate interest to be responsive to you and to ensure the proper functioning of our Services and Site and to improve our Site and Services, we use this Other Data and IP information to assist us in:

* providing, improving, and administering the Site;
* providing customer care and support services;
* providing security and safety to our Site visitors;
* monitoring activity usage of the Site; and
* measuring the effectiveness of the content we serve.

We do not use Other Data and IP Information to learn any information about you personally but it may be associated by us or our third party service providers with Personal Data that has been provided by you or otherwise available to or held by us. The collection of this Other Data and IP Information will cease once your use of the Site has ceased, depending on your use of our Services your IP Information may still be collected. However, the Other Data and IP Information collected may be retained, accessed, and used by us as long as necessary for the purposes described herein.

### What about cookies?

We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance our Services and Site. These technologies allow us, among other things, to store your preferences and settings, make it easier when you to sign-in, and analyze how our Site and Services are performing. You can learn more about our cookie practices below or by clicking [here](https://www.mimecast.com/cookie-information/).

We (or our third-party service providers) may collect your Personal Data using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies for:

* Storing your preferences and settings - We may store Personal Data in a cookie so you will see relevant local information when you return to the Site. We also may save preferences, like language and browser so these do not have to be reset each time you return to the Site.
* Detecting abuse or fraud on the Site.
* Social Media - Our Site includes certain social media features (such as a “share” or “like” button). Those features are provided by the applicable social media platform (such as Twitter or Facebook). Where Personal Data is collected through the social media feature, the use of that Personal Data is governed by the privacy policy published by the social media platform that provides the feature.
* Internet-Based Advertising - We also use cookies, Other Data and IP Information to target advertising for our Services on third party sites.
* Showing advertising - We use cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen so you don’t see the same one.
* Analytics - We use cookies to gather usage and performance data for the Site.

For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to evaluate your use of the Site, compile reports on activity, and provide other services relating to Internet usage. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies that store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the web page before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.

We have also implemented Display Advertising Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. This means that third-party service providers, including Google, display our ads on sites across the Internet and that we and third-party service providers, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie, see: [http://www.google.com/doubleclick](http://www.google.com/doubleclick)) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site.

By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. If you choose, you can opt out of the processing of data about you by Google for Display Advertising and/or customize the ads by using Google's Ads Settings at: [http://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated). You can opt out of the processing of Personal Data about you by Google generally by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your browser, or by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the Site itself or to other web analytics services.

For more information on Google Analytics, please visit: [https://www.google.com/analytics/](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?).

You can choose to reject certain collection technologies (such as cookies) but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. You can read more about cookies [here](https://www.mimecast.com/cookie-information/).

### How long will you use my Personal Data?

We will only retain your Personal Data and Other Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. We will also retain and use your Personal Data and Other Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our terms and conditions, other applicable terms of service and our policies.

To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity (if any) of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, and the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We also consider applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other requirements.

In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. Please see “What Are My Data Subject Rights and How Do I Exercise Them?” below.

### What is your commitment to children’s online privacy?

Our Site is not directed at children. Mimecast does not knowingly accept online Personal Data from children under the age of 18 through our Site. If you are under 18 or otherwise would be required to have parent or guardian consent to share Personal Data with Mimecast through our Site, you should not send any information about yourself to us through our Site.

### What are my Data Subject Rights and how do I exercise them?

In certain circumstances, you may object or withdraw your consent to certain processing of your Personal Data. You may also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Any of these rights may be exercised at any time. For customers of our customers, please contact your system administrator.

Personal Data rights.

You may have the right to restrict or object to the processing of your Personal Data by us, including for direct marketing. Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time via our dedicated online portal [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/757ef5c8-f01d-4b1e-8d22-59f9254f3068/02d91e7f-d064-46d6-8b37-cf0ef670b739). Please note these rights only apply in certain circumstances and may be limited by law. For example, where fulfilling your request would adversely affect other individuals or our trade secrets or intellectual property, where there are overriding public interests or where we are required by law to retain your Personal Data. We will respond to requests without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances).

Marketing. You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at via our dedicated online portal [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/757ef5c8-f01d-4b1e-8d22-59f9254f3068/02d91e7f-d064-46d6-8b37-cf0ef670b739), or by managing your subscription preferences through our Preference Center by clicking [here](https://info.mimecast.com/Subscription-Management.html).
