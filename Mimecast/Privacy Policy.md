What kind of technical data do we collect?
------------------------------------------

In addition to the Personal Data described above, we collect technical data and other information when you use our Services or visit our Site. You provide some of this Personal Data directly, such as when you register for a webinar, administer your organization’s Mimecast account, or contact us for support. We collect some of it by recording how you interact with our Site by, for example, using technologies like cookies or collecting basic device information like your browser type. We provide more information about cookies below.

### Technical information collected automatically from the Site

When you visit the Site, our systems automatically collect the following information about your visit (“Other Data”):

* the type of internet browser you use;
* the language of your browser;
* the website from which you have come to the Site;
* the webpages you view on our Site; and
* the links you clicked on our Site;

We also collect your public IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet). This IP address is typically collected on a country or regional level. We collect your IP address to verify that requests are legitimate and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (identified collectively as “IP Information”). "Other Data" does not include IP Information.

We use this Other Data and IP information to assist us in:

* providing, improving, and administering the Site;
* providing customer care and support services;
* providing security and safety to our Site visitors;
* monitoring activity usage of the Site; and
* measuring the effectiveness of the content we serve.

We do not use Other Data and IP Information to learn any information about you personally but it may be associated by us or our third party service providers with Personal Data that has been provided by you or otherwise available to or held by us. The collection of this Other Data and IP Information will cease once your use of the Site has ceased, depending on your use of our Services your IP Information may still be collected. However, the Other Data and IP Information collected may be retained, accessed, and used by us as long as necessary for the purposes described herein.

What about cookies?
-------------------

We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance our Services and Site. These technologies allow us, among other things, to store your preferences and settings, make it easier when you to sign-in, and analyze how our Site and Services are performing. You can learn more about our cookie practices below or by clicking [here](https://www.mimecast.com/cookie-information/).

We (or our third party service providers) may collect your Personal Data using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies for:

* Storing your preferences and settings - We may store Personal Data in a cookie so you will see relevant local information when you return to the Site. We also may save preferences, like language and browser so these do not have to be reset each time you return to the Site.
* Detecting abuse or fraud on the Site.
* Social Media - Our Site includes certain social media features (such as a “share” or “like” button). Those features are provided by the applicable social media platform (such as Twitter or Facebook). Where Personal Data is collected through the social media feature, the use of that Personal Data is governed by the privacy policy published by the social media platform that provides the feature.
* Internet-Based Advertising - We also use cookies, Other Data and IP Information to target advertising for our Services on third party sites.
* Showing advertising - We use cookies to record how many visitors have clicked on an advertisement and to record which advertisements you have seen so you don’t see the same one.
* Analytics - We use cookies to gather usage and performance data for the Site.

For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to evaluate your use of the Site, compile reports on activity, and provide other services relating to Internet usage. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies that store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the web page before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.

We have also implemented Display Advertising Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. This means that third-party service providers, including Google, display our ads on sites across the Internet and that we and third-party service providers, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie, see: [http://www.google.com/doubleclick](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/)) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site.

By using the Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. If you choose, you can opt out of the processing of data about you by Google for Display Advertising and/or customize the ads by using Google's Ads Settings at: [http://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated). You can opt out of the processing of Personal Data about you by Google generally by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your browser, or by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the Site itself or to other web analytics services.

For more information on Google Analytics, please visit: [https://www.google.com/analytics/](https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?#?).

You can choose to reject certain collection technologies (such as cookies) but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. You can read more about cookies [here](https://www.mimecast.com/cookie-information/).
