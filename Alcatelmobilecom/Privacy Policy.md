TCL may share your Personal Data globally with the companies within its corporate group to carry out the activities specified in this Privacy Notice.

We will take reasonable and practical steps to protect your Personal Data, including the following:

* We will use SSL and other technical measures to ensure encryption with regards to our services and products. We will regularly examine our practice of information collection, storage, and processing (including physical security measures) to prevent unauthorised system access.

* We will authorize our employees and personnel of third parties to access your Personal Data on a need-to-know basis in order to help us process your Personal Data and provide the services to you. These employees and external personnel (of third parties authorized by us) are subject to contractual confidentiality obligations.

* The security of your Personal Data is extremely important to us. We will continue our efforts to protect your Personal Data and implement safeguard measures, such as providing encryption protection for information storage and transmission, to prevent your Personal Data from unauthorised access, usage or disclosure.

* We will prudently select business partners and service providers, and implement the requirements for Personal Data protection to the business contracts between both parties.

* We will conduct security and privacy protection training courses, testing and publicity activities to enhance employees’ awareness of the importance of protecting Personal Data.

YOUR RIGHTS
-----------

Data protection laws may give you a number of legal rights in relation to the Personal Data that we hold about you. Not all privacy laws are the same so not all of these rights apply in all countries. You may refer to the Annexes of this Privacy Notice for more details about your rights in certain specific jurisdictions.

However, we recognize that your Personal Data belongs to you only and that enables you to control how we use it. Your rights may include:

* The right to request access to the Personal Data that we process about you, including the right to obtain information on and copy of such data;

* The right to request that we rectify or correct your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or incomplete;

* The right to request that we erase or delete your Personal Data in certain circumstances. Please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your Personal Data, but we are legally entitled to retain it;

* If permited by applicable laws, the right to lodge a complaint with the competent government agency if you think that any of your rights have been infringed by us.

You can exercise your rights by contacting us using the details set out in the “Contacting Us” section below.

We may need to confirm your verifiable consumer request before completing your request, and, for example, may ask for you to confirm data points we already have about you. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

USE OF COOKIES
--------------

We and our third-party advertising and data analytics partners use “cookies” and similar web technologies, including pixel tags or web beacons, (“Automated Collection Tools”) to support certain features of the TCL account, mobile devices and other websites and applications operated by us. Automated collection tools are pieces of code deployed on your device. The Automated Collection Tools allow the website to recognize your browser or device during your visit to the TCL website/application or when you return to the TCL website/application. For further details about the cookies we use, please see our Cookies Policy, which can be found here: [https://www.alcatelmobile.com/cookie-policy/](https://www.alcatelmobile.com/cookie-policy/)

We use two types of Automated Collection Tools: “session cookies” and “persistent cookies”.

A session cookie expires after you close your browser. A session cookie will identify you during your browsing session by assigning a randomly generated unique identification number to your device. We use session cookies:

* To enable us to provide products and services to you and manage transactions. For example, we may deploy a cookie to remember what items you have stored in an online shopping basket; and

* For certain content management and editing purposes.

Persistent cookies do not expire when you close your browser. We use persistent cookies:

* To record whether a visitor is logged in to the TCL account;

* To record when a visitor to the TCL account or other TCL website / application gives consent to our use of cookies, when applicable;

* For performance and design purposes. For example, we might use cookies to track which parts of our websites or applications are popular and to figure out how to improve their functionality;

* To improve user experience and personalize what you see. For example, we might use cookies to record user preferences and to ensure that more relevant website / application content (including advertising content) is delivered to users;

* To enable us and third-party partners that we work with to deliver advertisements or tailor marketing messages that you have consented to receive. For example we may use cookies to record what products and services you buy or show interest in and use third party services to enable relevant advertisements to be shown on our and other websites/applications based on that information; and

* For certain content management and editing purposes.

**_How to Manage Automated Collection Tools_**

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your device. You may also delete cookies as soon as you leave the TCL account or other TCL website/application. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit the TCL account, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the TCL account or other TCL website/application.

For example, the Help portion of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new Automated Collection Tools, and how to entirely disable Automated Collection Tools.  With regards to some of the popular browsers you can find more information by clicking on the following relevant links: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en); [Microsoft Edge](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy); [Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences) Firefox; [Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies); [Opera](https://www.opera.com/help/tutorials/security/privacy/) and [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411?locale=en_US).

Where required by law, we will present you with a cookie banner the first time you visit our website/application that explains what type of Automated Collection Tools we use and which asks your consent for some of the Automated Collection Tools we use.

**_Personal Data Collected through Automated Collection Tools_**

We use the Personal Data collected through Automated Collection Tools for the purposes specified above (including in the Section “Uses of Personal Data”).  For those cookies where we ask for your consent to deploy them, we also rely on consent as the legal basis for processing Personal Data collected through those cookies.
