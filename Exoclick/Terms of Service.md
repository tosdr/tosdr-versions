16.4. If ExoClick processes any personal data of end users in EEA (“End Users”) in connection with the provision of its services, the [Data Processing Agreement](https://www.exoclick.com/data-processing-agreement/) (“**DPA**”) is applicable to such processing.

In which case, when these countries do not benefit from an adequacy decision under the Article 45 of the GDPR, the parties agree to use a variety of measures to ensure that End Users personal data transferred to these countries receives adequate protection in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), such as signing the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.

16.5. Publisher’s privacy policy available to End Users shall disclose that third party advertisers may place cookies on the browsers of visitors to Publisher’s Website(s). In accordance to EU Directive 2002/58/EC as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC, Publishers must provide End Users with clear and comprehensive information regarding any devices (such as cookies or local shared objects) in use at their websites for storing information in the User’s terminal equipment or retrieving already stored information from the said terminal equipment. 

Publishers must also implement an opt-in system which ensures that the prior and informed consent is obtained from End Users in the European Union before any such devices are used or installed in the End Users’ terminal equipment. Therefore, Publishers must allow End Users to express their choice by a clear positive act as well as to modify it with the same simplicity.

ExoClick makes the cookies information available to the Publisher in its Privacy Policy, shall the Publisher be obliged to disclose detailed information on Publisher Website(s) regarding the cookies being placed by ExoClick on the browsers of visitors to Publisher’s Website(s). For instance, a link to the ExoClick’s Privacy Policy, allowing End Users to learn more and object to ExoClick services.

ExoClick reserves the right to audit Publisher’s consent collection mechanisms to ensure compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. Such audits will involve a review of relevant consent forms and documentation, with proper advance notice, no more than once a year, unless significant compliance concerns arise. Publisher agrees to provide necessary cooperation and access.  Furthermore, Publishers must also provide ExoClick, when applicable, with proof of consent upon request so that ExoClick can rely on it at any time.

16.6. Each party warrants to the other that, during the term of this Agreement, and the DPA, it shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations (including but not limited to laws governing privacy, and data protection).

**SEVENTEEN.- INDEMNIFICATION. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

17.1. Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold ExoClick and its officers, directors, shareholders, successors, affiliates, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all costs, claims, demands, liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and attorney fees arising from any claims and lawsuits or proceeding for libel, slander, copyright, and trademark violation as well as all other claims resulting from (i) the participation on the ExoClick Network, (ii) operation of the Publisher’s Website(s) submitted to ExoClick for participation on the ExoClick Network or (iii) otherwise arising from a relationship with ExoClick.

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL EXOCLICK’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEED THE LAST MONTH’S PAYMENTS TO THE PUBLISHER.

**EIGHTEEN.- MODIFICATION.**

18.1. ExoClick reserves the right to amend the provisions of the present Agreement that are minor in scope or nature, and to do so without citing any reasons, provided such modifications do not lead to the Agreement as a whole being restructured. ExoClick will communicate, by e-mail or electronic means or through the Administration Panel, the modified conditions at least two weeks prior to the Effective Date. Publishers who do not object in writing to the modification within four weeks after the receipt of the communication will be deemed to have accepted the respective modification. ExoClick will specifically indicate the possibility of objecting to the modification and the consequences of the four-week deadline.

18.2. If the Publisher(s) objects to the new (modified) Terms, ExoClick´s request to so modify them will be deemed to have been rejected. The Agreement will then be continued without the proposed modification. The right of the parties to terminate their participation on the ExoClick Network remains unaffected hereby. The possibility of terminating the Agreement will also be indicated specifically.

**NINETEEN.- NON-SOLICITATION.**

During the term of this Agreement, and any renewal thereof, and for one (1) year after its termination for any reason, Advertiser agrees that it will not do business directly or indirectly with any Publisher listed on the ExoClick Network, or directly or indirectly solicit or induce such Publisher to do business directly with the Advertiser. Advertiser understands and agrees that this prohibition is a key consideration and inducement for ExoClick to enter into this Agreement with Advertiser, and to provide the services hereunder.

**TWENTY.– DISPUTE RESOLUTION.**

20.1. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Spain.

20.2. For any matter related to the interpretation or execution of this Agreement, the parties expressly waive to submit to any courts which might have jurisdiction over the subject matter, and agree to submit to the sole competence and jurisdiction of the Courts of the City of Barcelona.

**TWENTY ONE.- GENERAL PROVISIONS.**

21.1. Force Majeure. Except for payment obligations, if either party is prevented from performing or is unable to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, including but not limited to acts of God, acts of civil or military authorities, riots or civil disobedience, wars, strikes or labor disputes (each, a “Force Majeure Event”), such party’s performance shall be excused and the time for performance shall be extended accordingly provided that the party immediately takes all reasonably necessary steps to resume full performance. If such party remains unable to resume full performance fifteen (15) days after the Force Majeure Event, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice.

21.2. Severability. Should any of the provisions of this Agreement be adjudged invalid or unenforceable by the rules and regulations of Spain or a Spanish court, such provisions shall be deemed several from the remainder of this Agreement and not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement. In that case, such provisions shall be changed and interpreted to achieve the purposes of those provisions as much as possible within the extent of relevant laws or judgment of the court.

21.3. Survival. Sections 14, 15, 16, 19, and 20 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason. All other rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall expire upon termination of this Agreement, except that all payment obligations accrued hereunder prior to termination or expiration shall survive such termination.

21.4. Assignment. ExoClick is hereby authorized to assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other partyprovided that the assignee shall assume all rights and obligations under this Agreement

Publisher/Advertiser shall not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations. However, Publisher/Advertiser may, without the consent of ExoClick, assign this Agreement to an entity merging with, consolidating with, or purchasing substantially all its assets or stock, provided that the assignee shall assume in writing all rights and obligations under this Agreement.

If the Publisher/Advertiser changes its name, tax ID/VAT, or any other fiscal identifier in its account, re-registration on the platform will not be required. However, a new acceptance of the Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, will be necessary. This does not affect the continuation of the original entity’s obligations, as set out in Clause 21.3 (Survival). For minor changes (e.g., contact details or payment information), re-acceptance will not be required unless ExoClick specifically requests it due to operational, legal, or fiscal reasons, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

21.5. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person (including by internationally recognized commercial delivery service), and on the day the notice is sent when sent by verified facsimile or email with confirmation receipt, if the time of transmission is during recipient’s business day, or if not on the next business day thereafter, in each case to the respective parties at the postal or email addresses provided by the them in writing.

Either party may change its address by providing the other party with written notice of the change in accordance with this section.

21.6. Relationship of Parties. The parties are independent contractors and will have no right to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other party. Neither party shall hold itself out as an agent of the other party. This Agreement will not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency, joint venture or formal business entity of any kind.

21.7. Waiver. No delay or failure by either party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. All waivers must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party waiving its rights. A waiver by any party of any breach or covenant shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of any other covenant.

21.8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. The information and documents provided by Publisher(s) and Advertiser(s) to ExoClick, as requested by the latest in order to enter the Agreement, shall be also considered as part of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended without the written consent of the parties.

21.9. Headings. The headings of the articles and paragraphs contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience and are not intended to be part of or to affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

21.10. Construction. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Agreement has been jointly prepared and its provisions will not be construed more strictly against either party as a result of its participation in such preparation.

21.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts or online, which taken together shall form one legal instrument.

1.12. No Third Party Beneficiaries.
