Publishers must also implement an opt-in system which ensures that the prior and informed consent is obtained from End Users in the European Union before any such devices are used or installed in the End Users’ terminal equipment.

ExoClick reserves the right to audit Publisher’s consent collection mechanisms to ensure compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. Such audits will involve a review of relevant consent forms and documentation, with proper advance notice, no more than once a year, unless significant compliance concerns arise. Publisher agrees to provide necessary cooperation and access.  Furthermore, Publishers must also provide ExoClick, when applicable, with proof of consent upon request so that ExoClick can rely on it at any time.

16.6. Each party warrants to the other that, during the term of this Agreement, and the DPA, it shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations (including but not limited to laws governing privacy, and data protection).

**EIGHTEEN.- MODIFICATION.**

18.1.
