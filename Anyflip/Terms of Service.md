You will not be credited for the time your books were suspended. Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using the Services any time.

### 3\. Payment and Fees

#### 3.1 Paid Services

Some portions of the Service may have fees associated with them (each, a "Paid Service"). You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for any portion of the Service at any time. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. One such Paid Service may be the Digital Sales Feature, further described in Section 14 below.

#### 3.2 Free Trial

We may make available a free trial for a Paid Service without charge to you ("Free Trial"). You may be required to enter a Payment Method (defined below) in order to register for a Free Trial. The applicable Paid Service will automatically commence, and your Payment Method will be charged in accordance with Section 3.2, at the end of the Free Trial unless you log into your account and cancel the Paid Service before the end of the Free Trial.

#### 3.3 Payment Information

You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your Services account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize AnyFlip or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you ("Payment Method"), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the purchase.

#### 3.4 Subscriptions

For purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:

● Your "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable.

● For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be not charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will still be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date.

You agree that our 3rd party payment processors shall be permitted to charge your credit card monthly in advance of providing the Service if you choose monthly payment mode. The Service may be interrupted on accounts that reach 10 days past due. Accounts that are not collectable by our 3rd party payment processors may be turned over to an outside collection agency for collection.

#### 3.5 Termination of Subscriptions

For any subscription to a Paid Service, that subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period’s (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).

**Warning: termination of subscription will disable your Published Content, If your Published Content  has been disabled for one year and you still do not renew the service, your Published Content  will be deleted automatically by our system.**

#### 3.6 Third Parties and Fee Collection.

You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to AnyFlip may be shared by AnyFlip with companies who work on AnyFlip’s behalf, such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to AnyFlip and servicing your account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your AnyFlip account upon demand, (ii) AnyFlip may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) AnyFlip reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more AnyFlip Services or your account with AnyFlip. Upon any such termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to your account and your use of the AnyFlip Service before termination.

#### 3.7 Refunds

Any fees charged to your account are non-refundable except as expressly stated in these Terms. If you or we cancel your subscription, you are not entitled to a refund of any subscription fees that were already charged for a subscription period that has already begun. You agree to submit any dispute regarding any charge to your account in writing to AnyFlip within thirty (30) days of the charge, otherwise that dispute will be waived and the charge will be final and not subject to challenge. Refunds (if any) made pursuant to a dispute, are at the discretion of AnyFlip.

#### 3.8 Taxes

You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of the AnyFlip Services, including sales, use, or value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to AnyFlip the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable.
