You accept, consent and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and that any further agreements you may choose to accept or agree to within the platform you will be bound by, including any agreements made by electonic medium or with electronic consent/approval, will have same effect as being physically signed.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Services.

We recommend that you print a copy of these Terms for future reference.

These Terms refer to the following additional terms (“Additional Terms”), which also apply to your use of the Services:

·       Privacy Policy;

·       Cookie Policy;

·       Acceptable Usage Policy;

·       Apple Application Terms.

There may also be additional terms which relate to a specific service or product we provide to you.

WE MAY MAKE CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

Our Services are constantly changing, to keep up with the dynamic needs of our clients and end users - so, these Terms might need to change, too. Where possible We will look to provide you with appropriate notice of any change to these Terms or any of our Additional Terms, including any newly introduced terms.

Every time you wish to use the Services, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the Terms that apply at that time.

If you don't like the new Terms, you are free to reject them - unfortunately, that means you won't be able to use the Services anymore. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, then please remember that means you agree to all of the Terms.

Except for changes by Us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and Us.

WE MAY MAKE CHANGES TO OUR WEBSITES OR APPLICATIONS

Compass is a dynamic learning tool, so the Services will change over time. We may change, suspend, update  or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you reasonable notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed content in violation of these Terms), or without any reason, and without notice.

Use of the websites, Compass Platform and applications are provided to you free of charge and under our agreement with the school who provided you with access, the school pays all relevant fees.   You therefore acknowledge that the websites, Compass Platform and applications  may be withdrawn at any time if our agreement with the school terminates for any reason.

WE MAY SUSPEND OR WITHDRAW OUR WEBSITE AND/OR APPLICATIONS

We do not guarantee that our websites, applications and the Compass Platform, or any content contained on them, will always be available or be uninterrupted. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the availability of all or any part of our Services for business and operational reasons. We will try to give you reasonable notice of any suspension or withdrawal.

You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our websites through your internet connection are aware of these Terms and Additional Terms, and that they comply with them.

LOGIN AND ACCESS

In using the Services, including logging into any of our websites, applications and the Compass Platform you agree to take all reasonable measures to protect your credentials and identity.

Any identified use of generic, shared or service accounts (to which you are not a listed party) to our platform may result in criminal, administrative or civil action being taken against you and/or the person who shared their credentials. We operate security mechanisms to identify attempts at screen scraping, bot use and script automation.

We have the right to disable any user identification code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our reasonable opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms.

If you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your user identification code or password, you must promptly notify us at support@compass.education

LOCATION SERVICES

 Some of our Services may offer the use of location services. Location services refers to the use of location based technologies including but not limited to GPS, IP address, mobile tower location and our iBeacon solutions. In the event that one or more of our solutions offer location services, you may receive a prompt when you use the Services. Where applicable, you may choose to enable or disable location services at any time, through your device and/or browser.

 We use location services for, but not limited to, the following purposes:

·       Intelligent prompting or filtering of address field information (eg. we may use your location to assist in entering addresses, by tailoring results based on your region);

·       Point-of-interest services (we are currently trialling how we can better support schools in offering extended field trip information, point of interest details and services across notable locations in key cities);

·       Extended application options (some schools may or limit some functionality to apps or services, based on your location. eg. If you are in the general office/reception of a school you may have additional options made available to you on your device, such as visitor sign in, student arrival options, etc);

·       Security and or verification (We may cross reference a combination of Location Service features to improve the accuracy and speed of a validation activity);

·       Field Trip tracking (Schools may elect to monitor the location of field trips and school buses);

·       Portal selection or suggestions (when you access Compass for the first time or to add additional accounts, We may use your location to assist us in filtering your school from across our client lists);

·       School enrolments (to support the rapid identification of nearby schools and provide tailored lists that hide schools in unrelated jurisdictions).

 You will receive a prompt in the event that location service functionality may be available on your device. Where possible and practical, use of core features will not be dependant on this functionality. In the event you do not enable location services, some aspects of the Compass Platform may not be available to you.

ENROLMENTS

We may offer online enrolments as a 'convenient option' for completing your school enrolment online, where applicable. Importantly, completion of, payment of and/or receipt of an enrolment 'offer' does not bind the client (school) to provide you or your child a position or enrolment at the school.

Further, under no circumstances do we and/or the client provide any warranty, guarantee or formal confirmation of acceptance to a school and/or educational institution. In using this service you agree to waive any liability (implied, direct and/or consequential) to us (including the relevant client), as permissible by law, with regard to the validity of the offer. We reserve the right to revoke an offer at any time. In the event that an offer is revoked after a payment has been received or processed, we will refund any monies as soon as possible (usually within 2 business days).

During the enrolment process, a number of details are collected on behalf of the school which we store in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In using our online enrolment modules, you may be prompted to enter information or details of other relevant related users. You should only provide personal details of individuals from who you have their express consent to provide these details to the school. In the event that you do not have consent, from another individual or third party - you should avoid entering their details and instead contact the school to discuss an alternate method of entry. In using our online enrolments module, you agree and accept that your details will be visible (and updatable) by other members of your household. Noting: Household refers to a residence of co-habitation - adults associated to a student with different household information will not have visibility or the ability to update each other. Should you not agree with any of these Terms you should not use our online enrolment system, instead you should contact the relevant school requesting a manual registration form.

LIVECHAT

We offer live chat to some users and clients across our platform. LiveChat is an optional feature and allows Us to provide rapid, text-based support to end-users. The LiveChat platform is provided through a third-party tool to which we have no control and as such should not be used for the transmission of personal, sensitive, financial or confidential information. We exclude all liability in relation to LiveChat and recommend that you familiarise yourself with LiveChat’s terms and condition and their privacy policy.
