Anti-Spam Policy
================

The following policy dictates in specific terms what is considered acceptable use of email/messaging bulk  
or otherwise, by CheckRaise Technologies.  
CheckRaise Technologies avoids “spam” – or sending unsolicited email, instant messaging or other  
communications. Spam is strictly against our policies and terms of use, and will result in the immediate  
deactivation of any partners who are found to have used spam in conjunction with their CheckRaise  
Technologies advertising agreements.  
1\. Subscriptions  
a) All mailing list subscriber information must include the date and time that the subscription was  
confirmed, as well as the IP address of the subscriber at the time of the confirmation. The user  
must be able to present this information at our request.

b) The nature of email address use must be fully disclosed, either on the page the subscription is  
made from or with a prominent link to the site’s Privacy Policy. It must be made reasonably clear  
how a user’s email address will be used and in what circumstances it will be shared.

c) Lists cannot be procured from outside parties unless the email sender has procured a list from an  
organization that sells or otherwise shares email distribution lists, and all of the following conditions  
are met:  
• The selling organization maintains a publicly viewable privacy policy disclosing that such sales may  
occur.  
• The privacy policy is prominently linked to from the page the subscriber signed up from.  
• The privacy policy has not changed substantially since the user signed up.  
• Records are kept of the date, time, IP address, and form location where the subscribing user  
signed up from.  
• Lists procured from outside parties must have been consistently handled in a manner comparable  
to our policies.  
• Users cannot populate lists with addresses obtained for a substantially different purpose than was  
originally disclosed to the user.  
• Mailing Practices  
• Third Parties must not modify the headers of any message in such a way that purposefully  
obfuscates the origin of the message.  
• Undeliverable addresses must be removed from all future mailings after no more than 5 bounces.  
• Third Parties are responsible for the practices of any affiliate program members they solicit the help  
of.  
• Third Parties using either outside advertising companies or 3rd party mailing programs must abide  
by the same policies and practices as those using our own bulk mailing list tools.

• All mailings must provide clear and simple to follow instructions for opting-out of future mailings,  
and all reasonable attempts must be made to facilitate the removal of a mailing list subscriber at  
their request.  
The user of this website is advised and acknowledges that our electronic mail service equipment may be  
located in California. In no event shall the user use our equipment in violation of California’s anti-spam laws  
including California Business & Professions Code sections 17538.4 and 17538.45.  
2\. Other  
Promotional messages, including social media must not be posted to bulletin boards, discussion forums,  
guestbooks, Usenet newsgroups, or any other similar service unless the operator of that service explicitly  
allows such messages.  
3\. Deactivation  
We reserve the right to cancel a marketing services agreement at any time should it feel there is suspicion  
that a marketing partner is in violation of these policies and / or engaged in the practice of spamming.
