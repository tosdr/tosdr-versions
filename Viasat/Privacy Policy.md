1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND SOURCES



Viasat may collect information about you when you use our Services, when we request information directly from

you, or when you contact us (collectively “Information”). The Information falls into the following categories, which

we treat differently under this Policy: Personal Information (“PI”), Viasat-Collected PI, and non-Personal Information

(each as defined below). This section explains each category of data and how we collect this data from you. We

may use contractors to help us provide the Services (“Vendors”) and they, in that capacity, may collect the

Information. Any Personal Information collected by our Vendors on our behalf will be treated as Viasat-Collected

PI under this Policy.



A. Personal Information



Information that Viasat and its Vendors, and/or Third-Party Services, may collect includes personally identifiable

information, which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Personal

Information”). Examples of Personal Information or PI include your first and last name, e-mail address, phone

number, address, full payment account number, and IP addresses, as well as demographic information such as

gender, age, zip code, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases. To the extent any non-Personal Information

(defined below) is combined by, or on behalf of, Viasat with Personal Information Viasat itself collects directly from

you on the Services (“Viasat-Collected PI”), we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this

Policy.



B. Non-Personal Information



Information that Viasat and its Vendors, and/or Third-Party Services, may collect includes certain information about

you when you access or use the Services (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include browser type,

operating system, information about your use of the Services, and data regarding network-connected hardware

(e.g., computer or mobile device). Usage Information that is “de-identified” (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers

from data to make it no longer personally identifiable) is considered under this Policy to be data that is not Personal

Information (“non-Personal Information”), which may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as

prohibited by applicable law.



C. Children and Minors



Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or older, if applicable law provides for different protections) and

we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we are processing the personal

information pertaining to a child inappropriately, please contact us using the information provided under the “How

to Contact Us” section below.



D. How Information is Collected



(1) Information You Provide to Us



You may provide us with Information when you register for or use our Services. Personal Information that we

process may include your name, address, email address, phone number, Airline frequent flyer account number, and

a credit or debit card number or other financial or payment-related information. We will retain your Personal

Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, as needed to provide Services, and

to comply with our legal obligations.



(2) Information Automatically Collected



When you use our Services, we may use cookies, log files, or other now and hereafter developed tracking

technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) to collect Information. Tracking Technologies help us automatically collect

certain Information without you affirmatively providing it to us. This may include processing of data regarding your

login credentials, browser type, operating system, software version, Internet Protocol (IP) address or device MAC

address, and platform types, as well as or in combination with Usage Information.

Viasat also may process Usage Information relating to your use of the Services, including but not limited to, data

consumed, hours of usage, the amount of time it takes to load a page, clicks to available links, and other data that

helps us to track and understand how users experience our Services, as well as information about the websites you

visit when using the Services. This information helps us, for instance, to improve the performance and user

experience of our Services, including to optimize, troubleshoot, measure, and monitor the performance of our

network and Services, including performing de-bugging, measuring service levels and identifying loading trends in

order to deliver internet traffic more efficiently.



(3) Information You Post



Any information, including comments and Personal Information that you post on public pages or our Services or

Third-Party Services is publicly available and may be processed by Viasat. Viasat is not responsible for the accuracy

of any information contained in those postings.



(4) Tracking Technologies



The Tracking Technologies that you may encounter using our Services, both on our Services and on Third-Party

Services, may include cookies as described herein:



Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your

browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to

a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We, our Vendors, and third parties with whom we have

a commercial relationship may use “cookies” in association with our Services for a variety of purposes, such

as to facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Services, as well as to conduct analytics on and collect

Usage Information related to our Services. Third- Party Services may also associate cookies with you, but

we are not responsible for that.



For example, we may use cookies to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them.

We may also use cookies to determine when your current session on the Services should be logged out

after a period of no activity, as well as for efficient management of the servers providing our Services. We

also may use cookies to generate analytics and aggregate information relating to your interactions with the

Services, including for example time spent on a page, or clicks to other pages or links. We and our Vendors

may use both session-based cookies and persistent cookies.



Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session and disappear from your computer

when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We may use session cookies to, for instance, allow

our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Services. This allows

us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as

you move through our Services.

Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or

turned off your computer. We may use persistent cookies to, for instance, allow our systems to remember

you and automatically log you in to our Services.



Some information about your use of the Services and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking

Technologies across time and services, and used by Viasat, our Vendors, and third parties for purposes such as to

associate different devices you use, and conduct analytics. See Section 5.C regarding certain choices regarding these

activities.

3. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE



Viasat shares your Information, including Personal Information, with third parties for purposes consistent with this

Policy. Further, we will not share Viasat-Collected PI with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes,

legislation on the processing of data for credit reporting purposes.

We also may share Information in the following additional circumstances:



• In connection with Viasat being acquired by or merged with another company, or in the event of a

consolidation or reorganization involving Viasat, or if all or a portion of our assets are transferred to another

company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or as part of a similar transaction, we may disclose, and

4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, SOCIAL FEATURES, AND ANALYTICS



The Services may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Services (e.g., apps and plug-ins),

websites, locations, platforms, applications or services operated by third parties (“Third-Party Service(s)”), and you

can use the Services to navigate to view and use Third-Party Services. These Third-Party Services may use their own

cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to independently collect information about you and may

solicit Personal Information from you.



Certain functionalities on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and certain

Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include:

enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Services and a Third-Party Service; “liking”

or “sharing” our content; logging in to the Services using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook

Connect to sign-in to the Services); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push

information to or from the Services). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services,

information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Services (see Section 1.D(3)) or by the

Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the

Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Viasat in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in

connection with the Services or otherwise by Viasat. Also, both Viasat and the third party may have access to certain

information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Service.



VIASAT MAY USE VENDORS FOR ANALYTICS SERVICES. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking

Technologies to help analyze use of the Services. Vendors may use Information generated by these services, e.g.,

your IP address and other Usage Information to evaluate your use of the Services, compile statistic reports on the

Services’ activity, and provide other services relating to Services activity and other internet usage.



Except to the extent Viasat combines information from Vendors, Third-Party Services, or other third parties with

Viasat-Collected PI, in which case Viasat will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this

Privacy Policy (see Section 1.A), data obtained by Viasat from a third party, even in association with the Services, is

not subject to Viasat’s limitations regarding Viasat-Collected PI under this Policy. The information third parties

independently collect, store, and share remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether

they continue to share information with Viasat, the types of information shared, and your choices on what is visible

to others on third-party services.



Viasat is not responsible for, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, the policies or business practices

of any third parties, including, without limitation, any informational content, products, services, software, or other

materials available on an external website. Viasat encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their

privacy policies and terms of use. See Section 5 for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding

their data collection and use, including regarding analytics.



5. YOUR CHOICES



A. Account Information



You may update or change your account contact and billing information by reaching us at the contact information

below. Viasat will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as

practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove, or delete all of your information or public

postings from our databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve

the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the

purposes for which the data is retained to the extent permitted by applicable law.



If you would like to opt-out of receiving direct marketing communications from us, you may do so by following any

instructions included in the communication or by contacting us at the contact information provided below.



B. Your Rights



To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you have the right to: (a) confirm whether we process Personal

Information about you; (b) access certain Personal Information we maintain about you; (c) exercise your right to

data portability; (d) request that we update, correct or rectify, amend, cancel or delete, or restrict your Personal

Information; (e) withdraw your consent previously given; (f) request that we not share your Personal Information

with third parties for ancillary or competing services; and/or (g) object at any time to the processing of your Personal

Information on legitimate grounds relating to your particular situation. We will comply with such requests to the

extent required by the applicable law of your jurisdiction. We will take appropriate steps to verify your identity

before granting you access to your information, which may require that you provide us with additional information.

We may apply a charge, to the extent permitted by applicable law, before we provide you with a copy of any of your

Personal Information we maintain. You may, depending on your location, have a right to file a complaint with a

government regulator if you are not satisfied with our response.



To exercise the above rights, please contact us using the information in the “How to Contact Us” section below. We

will consider and process your request in a timeframe that complies with the relevant legislation in your jurisdiction.



C. Tracking Technologies and Analytics



Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and

in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and

options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with

regard to HTML cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these

technologies, some parts of the Service (and Third-Party Services) may not work, and that when you revisit the

Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.



Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit;

however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like

many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a user’s

browser. To learn more about “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com, but we are not responsible for the

accuracy of this third-party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking

Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Services (and Third-Party Services) is to add the free

Ghostery plug-in to your browser (www.ghostery.com), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional,

browser-based cookies associated with the websites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies

and options of the parties operating those cookies. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from

Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-

out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to

http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html.



Viasat is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or

the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

Your Information may be transferred, stored and used in the United States or in other countries in which Viasat or

its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, Vendors, or Airline partners conduct operations, including for the purposes

described in the “Information Sharing and Disclosure” section herein. These countries may have data protection

laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). However, we have

taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with

this Privacy Policy. Where we operate as a data exporter under applicable law, we are committed to adopt all the

necessary measures and safeguards as to the cross-border data flow, as set forth by the applicable legislation. The

maintenance or fulfillment of the legal relationship between you and Viasat, or where the transfer is necessary by

virtue of a contract executed in your interest between Viasat and our service providers. When required by applicable

laws, we will request appropriate consent from you for international data transfers.



8. DATA SECURITY



Viasat has taken certain physical, administrative, and technical steps to safeguard the Personal Information we

collect from and about customers and visitors to our Services. While we seek to ensure the integrity and security of

our network and systems, we cannot guarantee the security of the Information from misappropriation by hackers

or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a

telecommunications network. We encourage you to take precautions to protect your personal data when you are

on the internet. In accordance with applicable law(s), we will notify you in the event we become aware of a security

breach involving your Personal Information stored by or for us.



9. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY



Viasat may amend this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will make the updated Policy available to you. If

we make any material changes in the way we use or disclose your Personal Information, we will provide you with

appropriate notice.
