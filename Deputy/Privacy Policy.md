**2\. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA** 

**2.1 Relationship of the parties.** 

(a) **Deputy as a processor**. The parties acknowledge that, except as set out in Section 2.1(b), Customer shall act as a controller and Deputy shall act as a processor in respect of its processing of Customer Personal Data disclosed to Deputy for the purpose of Deputy providing the Services. 

(b) **Deputy as a controller**. The parties acknowledge that Customer acts as a controller and Deputy may also act as a controller in respect of its processing of Customer Personal Data to: (i) comply with its own obligations under applicable law and regulations and to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; (ii) contact Authorised Users in relation to the Services and/or any Third Party Products and Services; (iii) provide any services directly to Authorised Users, other than the Services provided to Customer; (iv) facilitate the provision of Third Party Products and Services to Authorised Users; (v) conduct research and development and improve the Services in a way that is not specific to Customer; (vi) communicate directly with Authorised Users, other than for the purpose of providing the Services to Customer; (vii) protect the safety and security of the Services in a way that is not specific to Customer, including detecting and responding to Personal Data Breaches or malicious and unlawful activity; (viii) generate de-identified statistical data to uncover collective insights about the use of the Services (and not to specifically analyse personal characteristics); and/or (ix) process such Customer Personal Data in any other context which requires Deputy to determine the purposes and means of such processing. 

**2.2 Prohibited Data.** Customer will not disclose (and will not permit any Authorised User to disclose) any Sensitive Personal Data (including “Protected Health Information” as defined by the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to Deputy for processing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may disclose (and may permit its Authorised Users to disclose): (a) biometric data to Deputy for processing for the sole purpose of Deputy’s optional “Face Unlock” Kiosk feature; and (b) social security numbers, passport details, driver’s licence details and/or citizenship and immigration status to Deputy for processing for the sole purpose of Deputy’s “Deputy HR” product.

**2.3 Purpose Limitation.** Deputy shall process Customer Personal Data as necessary to perform its obligations under the Agreement and strictly in accordance with the documented lawful instructions of Customer (including the terms of the Agreement), or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties (the “**Permitted Purpose**”). Deputy shall not use, disclose or otherwise process the Customer Personal Data for any other purpose other than the Permitted Purpose, except where otherwise required by any law applicable to Deputy. Deputy shall notify Customer, without undue delay, if it becomes aware that Customer’s processing instructions infringe Applicable Data Protection Laws

**2.4 Security.** Deputy shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect Customer Personal Data against a Personal Data Breach and to preserve the security and confidentiality of Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Deputy’s security standards described at deputy.com/security (“**Security Measures**”). Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Deputy may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time.

**2.5 Personal Data Breach.** Upon becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach, Deputy shall notify Customer without undue delay by written notice with all relevant details reasonably available of the Personal Data Breach to allow Customer to fulfil its data breach reporting obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Deputy shall take further reasonable steps to contain, investigate and mitigate the effects of the Personal Data Breach. Deputy’s notification of or response to a Personal Data Breach in accordance with this Section 2.5 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Deputy of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach. 

**2.6 Confidentiality.** Deputy shall take reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate policies and procedures in place in relation to any person that it authorises to process Customer Personal Data (including Deputy’s employees, agents and Sub-processors) and to ensure that such persons are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

**2.7 Deletion or return of Customer Personal Data.** Upon written request from Customer, Deputy shall anonymise, delete or return to Customer all Customer Personal Data in its possession or control subject to any requirement on Deputy to retain some or all of the Customer Personal Data to comply with applicable laws, in which event Deputy shall isolate and protect the Customer Personal Data from further processing except to the extent required by such law until deletion is possible. Customer acknowledges that there may also be circumstances in which one or more of its Authorised Users are Authorised Users of one or more other customers and in such circumstances, Deputy will continue to process the applicable Customer Personal Data related to such Authorised User(s) until a written request from such Authorised User(s) is received by Deputy in accordance with this Section 2.7. 

**2.8 Cooperation and data subjects’ rights.** Deputy shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer (at Customer’s expense) to enable Customer to respond to: (a) any request from a data subject to exercise any of its rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws (including its rights of access, correction, objection, erasure, and data portability, as applicable); and (b) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint received from a data subject, regulator or other third party, in each case in respect of Customer Personal Data that Deputy processes on Customer’s behalf. In the event that any request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint is made directly to Deputy, Deputy shall promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the request, unless legally prohibited from doing so. 

**2.9 Data Protection Impact Assessment.** Deputy shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer (at Customer's expense) with undertaking an assessment of the impact of processing Customer Personal Data, and with any consultations with a data protection authority, if and to the extent an assessment or consultation is required to be carried out under the Applicable Data Protection Laws**.** 

**2.10 Audits.** Customer acknowledges that Deputy is regularly audited against ISO 27001:2013 standards by independent third-party auditors. Upon written request from Customer, Deputy shall: (a) supply a copy of its ISO 27001:2013 certificate to Customer so Customer can verify Deputy’s compliance with the ISO 27001:2013 standards, and this DPA; and (b) respond to reasonable written audit questions submitted to it by Customer (such responses will be in the manner and form that Deputy generally makes such responses available to its customers), provided that Customer shall not exercise this right more than once per year. Customer agrees that Customer shall exercise its rights under Clause 8.9 of the SCCs by instructing Deputy to comply with the audit measures described in this Section 2.10. To the extent that Deputy’s provision of information under this Section 2.10 does not provide sufficient information or Customer is required to respond to a regulatory authority audit, Customer agrees to a mutually agreed-upon audit plan with Deputy that: (i) involves the use of an independent third party; (ii) provides written notice to Deputy in a timely fashion; (iii) requests access only during business hours; (iv) accepts billing to Customer at Deputy’s then-current rates; (v) occurs no more than once annually; (vi) restricts its findings to only Customer Personal Data; and (vii) obligates Customer, to the extent permitted by law or regulation, to keep confidential any information gathered that, by its nature, should be confidential. 

**2.11 Sub-processors.** Customer agrees that Deputy may engage Sub-processors to process Customer Personal Data for the Permitted Purpose. The Sub-processors currently engaged by Deputy and authorised by Customer are listed at [deputy.com/terms/data-subprocessors](https://www.deputy.com/us/terms/data-subprocessors). Deputy shall ensure that: (a) there is a written agreement in place with each Sub-processor that imposes terms and conditions that require the relevant Sub-processor to protect Customer Personal Data to the standard required by the Applicable Data Protection Laws; and (b) it remains responsible to Customer for the performance of such Sub-processors data protection obligations under such terms and conditions. Deputy shall notify Customer if it adds any new Sub-processors at least 20 days before the proposed addition, in order to allow Customer to raise any reasonable objections on grounds of data protection. If Customer rejects the appointment of any new Subprocessor and Deputy is unable to perform its Services without this new Subprocessor, Customer shall have the right to terminate the Agreement.

**2.12 Restricted Transfers.** The parties agree that when the transfer of Customer Personal Data from Customer (as “data exporter”) to Deputy (as “data importer”) is a Restricted Transfer and Applicable Data Protection Laws require that appropriate safeguards be put in place, it shall be subject to the SCCs, which shall be deemed incorporated into and form part of this DPA, as follows:
