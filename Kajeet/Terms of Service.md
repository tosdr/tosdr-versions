These Terms are a binding agreement between Kajeet and you, and you agree to abide by these Terms. You understand and agree that you, or the organization(s) on whose behalf you are agreeing to these Terms, are responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of third parties (e.g., minors, employees) whom you authorize to access or use the Services (each, an “End User”), and you are responsible and liable for their strict compliance with these Terms.  References to “you” or “your” use of the Services apply to End User and their use of the Services in the same manner.  You acknowledge and agree that Kajeet may disable access to the Services for any particular End User who fails to comply with these Terms. By agreeing to these Terms and/or using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old and a resident of the United States.  If you do not agree to any of these Terms, you are not authorized to access or use the Services.

These Terms of Service were published on August 8, 2012 and will become effective September 7, 2012. Until September 7, 2012, the governing Terms of Service can be found here. By accessing or using the Services at any time from or after September 7, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

KAJEET CHARGES
--------------

This section describes the Kajeet Services and how charges are applied. Some Kajeet products, including handset and handset accessories, may require alternative methods of payment.

**Unless otherwise specified in a separate written agreement between Kajeet and you, the specific rates for each Service are detailed at** [kajeet.com/rates](https://kajeet.ezgnuq70-liquidwebsites.com/terms-of-services#) (the “Rate Card”).  Your use of each of those Services is subject to these Terms. Kajeet may introduce new rate plans and additional Services, or modify existing Services and rates, from time to time.

Kajeet wireless network services are provided on the Nationwide Sprint PCS Network. Roaming surcharges will not be applied by Kajeet. However, your handset may function with other carrier networks. **If you use another carrier’s network, you are subject to their charges and terms of service.**

**Please Note:** For any subscription service with an initial promotional period, charges will automatically apply after the promotional period is over. **If you do not cancel the subscription service before the end of the promotional period, the subscription service will continue and charges will apply until you cancel the service.**

You may be able to configure your account to enable purchases of particular Services by individual End Users.  For example, parents may configure an account so that End Users who are minors may purchase ringtones for their mobile devices, or employers may configure an account so that End Users who are employees may purchase access to specific Services.  By permitting End Users to access or purchase any particular Services, you are agreeing to be responsible for all purchased made by them.

CONTENT LICENSING
-----------------

Depending upon the particular phone or other device you use to access the Service, you may have access to the Kajeet Navigator™, which is Kajeet’s proprietary online store.  The following terms of this section apply only to content and services obtained through the Navigator.  The Navigator provides access to a variety of digital content, including, but are not limited to, ringtones, wallpaper, games, applications, software, and the content of mobile Web pages and network-based application services, as well as all related code, data structures, images, sounds, text, screens, game plans and derivative works thereof. Each discrete piece of content obtain from the Kajeet Navigator, such as an individual application or game is considered a “Navigator Content Item.”  Kajeet grants to each End User a non-exclusive, personal, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable limited license to use each Navigator Content Item downloaded by that End User solely on a single device and solely for personal, non-commercial purposes.  No rights or licenses are granted regarding Navigator Content Items other than the rights expressly granted above, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved by Kajeet and its licensors.

You acknowledge that software provided with or as a Navigator Content Item is licensed in object code format only, and no license is granted with respect to the source code format of any software provided.  You agree that you shall not (i) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or modify any Navigator Content Items; (ii) remove, efface or obscure any copyright or other proprietary notices from the Navigator Content Items; or (iii) reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, digitally transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, disseminate, broadcast, circulate, rent, lend, lease, grant a security interest, transfer, or assign any Navigator Content Items or otherwise transfer rights granted above to any third party.  You may not use the Navigator Content Items for any unlawful purpose or for any other purpose otherwise prohibited by these Terms.  You agree to erase any particular Navigator Content Items from the devices to which they have been downloaded upon receipt of notice requiring the same.

Navigator Content Items may include interactive games, features or applications that communicate over networks, possibly including the Internet. Some of these communications features may be automatic or may be enabled by default (for example, high score capture and scores reporting). Such automatic communications features do not require any personally identifiable information regarding End Users.  By installing any Navigator Content Item that includes such features, you consent to the operation of all such communications features.

You acknowledge that Navigator Content Items may include digital rights management (“DRM”) features.  DRM features are technological mechanisms designed to manage and enforce intellectual property rights in digital content.  You may not take any action to circumvent or defeat the security or content usage rules provided or enforced by any DRM features of the Navigator Content Items. You acknowledge that DRM mechanisms may be able to revoke an End User’s ability to access or use applicable Navigator Content Items.  You agree that neither Kajeet nor its licensors shall be responsible for the operation of such DRM in any way, including revocation of rights to access or use particular Navigator Content Items. You consent to the communications enabled and/or performed by any such DRM, including automatic updating of the DRM mechanism without further notice.  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Kajeet and its licensors from and against any and all claims, damages and expenses relating to use of any third-party DRM mechanism.

Each license with respect to any particular Navigator Content Item will become effective on the date an End User first downloads, installs and/or uses such Navigator Content Item, and it will remain in effect until terminated.  A license with respect to a particular Navigator Content Item will terminate immediately, without notice, if the relevant End User fails to comply with any term or condition of these Terms related to use thereof.  If an End User’s license for a particular content license is terminated, you agree to immediately remove that Navigator Content Item from the relevant device.  An End User may also terminate his or her license for that Navigator Content Item by removing such Navigator Content Item from the relevant device.  Please note: If you upgrade to a new Kajeet Device, previously purchased Navigator Content Items may not be transferable to the new device.  You acknowledge that you may need to re-purchase Navigator Content Items if you wish to use them on such new devices.

You acknowledge that many Navigator Content Items have been provided to Kajeet by third-party licensors (the “Content Providers”).  You agree that each Content Provider is an intended third-party beneficiary of Kajeet’s rights under these Terms as related to Navigator Content Items that it has provided through Kajeet, and you agree that each Content Provider may enforce such rights directly against you.You acknowledge that, except with respect to Navigator Content Items, as set forth above, Kajeet grants no rights or licenses in or to any data or content to which you obtain access through the Services, nor any rights or licenses to use any particular Web sites, downloadable files, software, media or any other subject matter transmitted or obtained through the Services.  You acknowledge that data and content accessed or downloaded through the Services may also be subject to licenses or terms of use required by the third-party providers of such data and content, and you agree to abide the terms thereof with respect to any data and content accessed or downloaded through the Service.

Kajeet is a company conceived of in 1996 by Daniel J. W. Neal and incorporated in 2003 to realize a vision for mobile devices and other mobile services that could be safely used by children and all those who love them. From his vision has grown a patent portfolio of thirty three (33) issued U.S. patents with a number of pending applications directed to different aspects of this technology.

Kajeet products and services are protected by the following issued U.S. Patents: 10,555,140; 10,313,532; 10,285,025; 10,057,300; 10,009,480; 9,237,433; 9,137,389; 9,137,386; 9,125,057; 8,995,952; 8,929,857; 8,918,080; 8,774,755; 8,774,754; 8,755,768; 8,731,517; 8,725,109; 8,712,371; 8,706,079; 8,667,559; 8,644,796; 8,639,216; 8,634,803; 8,634,802; 8,634,801; 8,630,612; 8,611,885; 8,600,348; 8,594,619; 8,588,735; 8,285,249; 8,078,140; 7,945,238; 7,899,438; 7,881,697

. Other patent applications and continuation-in-part applications are pending.

The Kajeet patent portfolio includes four patent families directed to (1) policy control for mobile devices, (2) electronic wallets for managing pre-paid and plan-limited mobile devices, (3) selective access control for mobile devices, and (4) sponsored connectivity services for mobile devices. Within these families are numerous claims applicable to Mobile Device Management, Shared Data Plans, and Employer-Managed Mobile Devices.

The Kajeet patent portfolio has been strategically and purposefully prosecuted to mitigate the risk of invalidity challenges. As a result of extensive pre-filing patent and non-patent prior art searches and prosecution citations, comprehensive Invention Disclosure Statements (IDS) have been progressively filed during prosecution of all Kajeet patent applications. Eight different patent examiners have reviewed this portfolio; hence, existing validity opinion at the patent office is exceptionally diverse. As we learn of new prior art, it will be submitted on an IDS and reviewed by the patent office as part of our on-going prosecution efforts.

In addition, we have fully vetted the patent eligibility issue relative to our patents and are confident that the patents in the Kajeet portfolio are not directed to abstract ideas as are some other software patents. Instead, the inventions in the Kajeet patents are specific improvements in mobile device and mobile network communication technologies. They address a problem that did not exist until the proliferation of mobile devices in the work place, among families and children, or at schools. Solutions and products developed and commercialized by Kajeet provide for safe and secure use of the latest mobile technology.

**Commercialization and Licensing of Our Patents**

Kajeet is a successful and growing operating company that was started by three dads figuring out how mobile technology, kids, and parents work best. They had the foresight to protect their ideas through b_uilding a robust patent portfolio. Kajeet is not a “patent troll.” Kajeet, having raised over $100 million in venture capital, is a model of American invention, innovation_, and commercial success delivering real solutions across the U.S. and beyond.

Kajeet has allowed others to compete with it in certain market segments by licensing its patents and source code in return for commercially reasonable licensing fees.

Kajeet provides valuable products and services to fulfill real market needs. Kajeet has made a significant investment in developing its patent portfolio so as to avail itself of protection available to it under the law from those individuals and entities that are practicing the unique Kajeet intellectual property without a license.

As a good corporate and commercial citizen, Kajeet is actively licensing its patents and invites any person or company seeking to license the Kajeet patent portfolio to contact Kajeet directly at:

All purchases of Kajeet Services are final, and payments for Kajeet Services are non-refundable.  However, if you think that there has been an error in any charge posted to your account, please notify us (Click here.) within 30 days after the charge is posted to request an investigation of your claim. If we determine the charge was made in error, a credit will be posted to your account.

ACCOUNT & SERVICE STATUS
------------------------

We reserve the right to temporarily suspend Services if payment has not been made when due.  Some Services may require payment in advance, in which event you may be unable to activate those Services until payment is made.  While suspended, you will be unable to utilize the Services.  For example, if the suspended Services are cellular telephone voice and/or data services, you will be unable to make or receive calls, send or receive text messages, download ringtones or other applications, or use any other Services. If telephone services are suspended, Kajeet will hold your phone number for 90 days even when your account is inactive. After 90 days of suspension, however, Kajeet will deactivate such accounts, and you will lose your phone number and any remaining balance in your account. (Note: For telephone services, even while suspended of after an account is deactivated, you will still have an ability to call 911 from Kajeet devices with phone capabilities.)

You understand that after your account is deactivated, you do not have any continuing rights to any number, e-mail address or other identifier we may assign to your device or account.  You may not modify, change or transfer any of these except as we allow or as provided by law. In certain instances you may transfer your number from another carrier to us, or from us to another carrier. We do not guarantee that transfers to or from us will be successful.

Kajeet reserves the right to discontinue delivering Services to any customer it believes is abusing the Service, not complying with these Terms, is performing illegal or inappropriate acts using the Kajeet Services and/or is abusing the Service through excessive and/or commercial use.
