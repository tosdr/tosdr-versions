Etymonline - Terms of Service
=============================

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with etymonline.com website and Etymonline mobile application (the "Service") operated by Etymonline ("us", "we", or "our").

Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our website and Etymonline mobile application (the "Service").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

### Accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

### Privacy

Our Privacy Policy explains our collection and use of information on the service, including information you may consider personal. You consent to the information practices described in that policy as it may be updated from time to time.

### Payment and Fees

Some elements of the Services may be offered by Etymonline for a fee. The fees for such Services are posted on the Website and/or the App Stores. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, fees are subject to change without notice. You agree to pay Etymonline in advance the applicable fees for the Services provided by Etymonline under these Terms.

If you elect to pay applicable fees with a credit card, Etymonline will bill your credit card for all fees and you hereby authorizes Etymonline to charge your credit card or to charge any form of payment you have obtained to replace your credit card. Etymonline is not responsible for any charges or expenses (e.g., for overdrawn accounts, exceeding credit card limits, etc.) resulting from charges billed by Etymonline.

### Subscriptions

By purchasing any Services that are sold as an ongoing subscription (each a “Subscription”), you acknowledge that your Subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation of the automatic renewal of your Subscription and you acknowledge that your Subscription will be automatically extended for successive periods.

Etymonline may submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your payment method within the 48-hour notice requirement. If you cancel the automatic renewal of your Subscript, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Subscription fee paid for the then-current Subscription period. If Etymonline does not receive payment for a renewal prior to the date of renewal, Etymonline may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) demand full payment, (ii) charge any form of payment you have obtained to replace your provided form of payment (e.g., you have obtained a replacement credit card number), and you hereby authorize Etymonline to do so, and (iii) terminate or suspend your Subscription.

### Changes to Our Service
