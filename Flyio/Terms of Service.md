### [](#5-disclaimer)5. DISCLAIMER

* * *

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE FLY.IO SERVICES AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND FLY.IO AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS, AND LICENSORS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, OR CONDITIONS, RELATING TO THE FLY.IO SERVICES AND DOCUMENTATION WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. FLY.IO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ALL ERRORS CAN BE CORRECTED, OR THAT OPERATION OF THE FLY.IO SERVICES SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.

### [](#6-limitation-of-liability)6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

* * *

IN NO EVENT WILL FLY.IO OR ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FLY.IO SERVICES, EVEN IF PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FLY.IO’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’, SUPPLIERS’, CONTRACTORS’, AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE FLY.IO SERVICES) WILL NOT EXCEED THE SUM OF ALL AMOUNTS PAID AND PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO FLY.IO FOR THE USE AND ACCESS TO THE FLY.IO SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE APPLICABLE CLAIM. IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT IN THE EVENT ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER IS DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH HEREIN WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT.

### [](#7-confidentiality)7. CONFIDENTIALITY

* * *

**“Confidential Information”** means any nonpublic information of a party (the “Disclosing Party”), whether disclosed orally or in written or digital media, that is identified as “confidential” or with a similar legend at the time of such disclosure or that the receiving party (the “Receiving Party”) knows or should have known is the confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fly.io Services and Documentation, and all enhancements and improvements thereto will be considered Confidential Information of Fly.io. Information will not constitute the other party’s Confidential Information if it (i) is already known by the Receiving Party without obligation of confidentiality; (ii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to or use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; (iii) is publicly known without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is lawfully received from a third party without obligation of confidentiality. The Receiving Party will not use or disclose any Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by this Agreement and will protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it uses with respect to its own confidential information, but in no event with safeguards less than a reasonably prudent business would exercise under similar circumstances. The Receiving Party will take prompt and appropriate action to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Except as subject to applicable law, if any Confidential Information must be disclosed to any third party by reason of legal, accounting or regulatory requirements, the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the order or request and permit the Disclosing Party (at its own expense) to seek an appropriate protective order. Customer acknowledges that Fly.io can collect usage and performance data related to its provision of the Fly.io Services and obtain from third parties Customer’s usage data of third-party products and services purchased or acquired through Fly.io (collectively, “Usage Data”). Fly.io may use Usage Data to provide and improve its products and services, to market additional products and services to Customer, and disclose Usage Data in an aggregated and de-identified manner in connection with its business. As between the parties, Fly.io owns all rights in the Usage Data. The parties agree they can have competing products and services if these are not developed with or use the other party’s Confidential Information.

### [](#8-indemnification)8. INDEMNIFICATION

* * *

Customer will defend at its expense any suit brought against Fly.io, and will pay any settlement Customer makes or approves, or any damages finally awarded in such suit, insofar as such suit is based on a claim arising out of or relating to (a) any use of the Fly.io Services not in accordance with this Agreement or as specified in the Documentation; (b) any use of the Fly.io Services in combination with other products, equipment, software or data not supplied by Fly.io; (c) any modification of the Fly.io Services by any person other than Fly.io or its authorized agents; or (d) Customer’s breach or alleged breach of Section 4.1 (Customer Warranty).

Customer agrees that Fly.io may use Customer’s name and logo in Fly.io’s marketing materials or communications (including, but not limited to, Fly.io’s website and in Fly.io’s marketing presentations) for the sole purpose of indicating Customer as a user of the Fly.io Services. Neither party will issue a press release announcing its relationship with the other party without the other party’s prior approval, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Fly.io a non-exclusive and limited license to use and publicly display Customer’s logo as set forth in this Section.

The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Force Majeure. Fly.io will not be liable hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement on account of strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental action, labor conditions, earthquakes, material shortages or any other cause that is beyond the reasonable control of Fly.io.
