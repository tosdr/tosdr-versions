### Personal Information Collected By Crutchfield

Crutchfield uses information that we collect from our visitors to personalize and improve your visit at Crutchfield.com. During the past twelve months, we have gathered the following types of information:

**Information you give us:** Crutchfield collects any information which you enter on our Website. This information is normally provided when you search, buy, participate in a contest, sweepstakes or on-line survey, or when you communicate with any of our departments such as customer service, sales or technical services through our Website, telephone, mail or fax. You also provide information when you establish an account with us. Examples of the type of information you may supply us with include your name, address, telephone number, credit card information, e-mail addresses, and financial information such as your Social Security number.

**Automatic Information collected by us:** Whenever you visit our Website we collect and store information such as "cookies" which remember information about a visitor from one page to the next and from one visit to the next. We collect and analyze the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; password; computer and connection information such as your browser type and version; operating system and platform; purchase history; confirmation when you open e-mail that we send you; the URLs which lead you to and around our Website and other sites on the World Wide Web, including the date and time; the pages and or products you viewed or searched for and the phone number used to call our voice telephone numbers. Your browser allows you to reject cookies and software is available from third parties which will allow you to visit our Website without providing this information. You are welcomed at our Website if you use this software but we will not be able to offer you our personalized services.

**Orders:** If you place an order we use a secure order form which requires you to provide contact, billing, and financial information. This information is transmitted to your credit card company to authorize your purchase. We may also share some personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email and/or telephone number with third parties such as, but not limited to, Apruved and Neustar, that attempt to prevent fraudulent or security risks from placing an order. These third parties will use this information solely for that purpose and will not be allowed to use this information to market or sell to you or to share any personally identifiable information with third parties.

**Order Status Updates:** Signing up for Order Status updates means that Crutchfield will use your mobile phone number to text you updates when the status of your order changes. These updates will include, but are not limited to, shipping confirmations and delivery alerts. (Message and data rates may apply.)

**Information Shared When You Finance:** At certain times we may offer financing options with or without third party participation. Whether you contact us online, on the phone, or in person, if you use a financing option the information provided by you (such as your address, birth date, social security number, and credit card number) may be used to request a credit report from third parties or may be sent to a third party for processing.

**Action Tags:** Crutchfield's web pages may contain action tags set by third party firms such as Howl, and Connexity for the purpose of collecting anonymous information about the usage of our site by customers. These companies may also use this anonymous information to serve ads that may be of interest to you when you visit other sites across the internet. Action tags are also known as web beacons or 1 pixel gifs. Action tags are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our Website. They do not use personally identifiable information, such as names or addresses. Should you wish to opt out of providing this anonymous information you may do so by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer opt out page located at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp#) and the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt out page located at [https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control)

These chat features collect personal information, including but not limited to email address and the content of chat communications. Conversations with both our automated and live chat features are recorded.

### Sharing of Information with third-parties

**Affiliated Businesses and Crutchfield Corporation:** We may share any information that you supply to us with Crutchfield New Media LLC, a Virginia LLC, a third party entity that is employed by Crutchfield to manage certain parts of the Crutchfield website.

**Independent Contractors:** We employ contact center software providers and Turn To to provide certain services to us such as sending e-mail, providing Social Question & Answer functionality, providing click to call telephone calling services, analyzing customer lists and data, providing marketing assistance, or consulting services. These third parties will have access to the information needed to perform their functions but cannot use that information for any direct marketing purpose.

**Third party service providers:** Some of the products which we sell require us to provide your name, address, phone number and product serial number to the third party service provider(s) (Sirius, OnStar, and Allstate) that requires this information in order to perform their services. Additionally, you may choose to take advantage of support-related services provided by third parties, such as those provided by Zoho Assist. These third party service providers have their own privacy and data collection policies which are not controlled by Crutchfield. We have no control, responsibility or liability for these policies and urge you to contact the third party provider if you have any questions.

**Orders and Catalog Requests:** When you place your order and/or when you request that we send you a catalog from time to time we may share your name, mailing address and purchase category information with a few carefully selected marketing partners who may bring you offers of interest. If you wish to opt out of sharing this information with these companies, please call 1-800-653-0982 or use the following link: [Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information](https://www.crutchfield.com/S-vdvooY1R3qU/support/privacyrequest.aspx?version=donotshare).

We will release personally identifiable information to third parties and organizations when we believe it is appropriate for us to do so to comply with the law.

### Business Transfer

Crutchfield has been in business independently for years, and our intent is to continue in this manner. However, in the unlikely event that Crutchfield is sold, has substantially all of its assets acquired or merges or becomes affiliated with any other individual or entity any customer information owned or under the control of Crutchfield may be one of the transferred assets.

Only you or a person whom you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. So as to ensure your privacy, we reserve the right to deny a request from an authorized agent who does not submit proof that they have been authorized to act on your behalf. If you wish to authorize another to act on your behalf, please be advised that Crutchfield may require that you provide the authorized agent with signed written permission to submit a request and verify your own identity and confirm your permission directly with us, unless the authorized agent has a power of attorney. However, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

##### Our verification process works as follows:

When you contact us to exercise your rights to know, delete, or correct your personal information, we will verify your identity by having you provide information from your most recent order or (unless the subject of the request to correct is your name or address, in which case we will work with you to find another means of verifying your identity). We will then verify your request by asking you to confirm the action(s) to be taken by phone call or a response to an email. With a request to correct, we may require information from you to demonstrate that our data is incorrect. This information shall only be used and/or maintained by the business for the purpose of correcting your personal information and to comply with any record-keeping obligations we may have under the law.

You may make a verifiable consumer request up to two times within a 12-month period, without charge. Unfortunately, we cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension time period (up to 90 days). If you have an account with us, we will deliver our response to the email associated with that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt, unless we receive a specific request for information collected after January 1, 2022. The response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

You have a right to appeal any denial of a consumer right. In order to appeal a denial of a deletion request you must:

1. Reply to the email with the privacy decision, email us at Privacy@Crutchfield.com or call us at 1-800-653-0982 within 45 days of receiving the denial decision.
2. Include the reason that your denied privacy request should be overturned.
3. Allow Crutchfield up to 45 days to review your appeal and provide a decision.

**Right to Equal Service:** We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights as a consumer under any applicable laws. Unless permitted by law, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by law that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any legally-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
