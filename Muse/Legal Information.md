By submitting your personal data or engaging with our Services, you consent to this transfer, storing, or processing.

Your Personal Data Use Choices
------------------------------

We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:

* **Promotional Offers from the Company.** If you do not want us to use your email address to promote our own products and services, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form where we collect your data or at any other time by logging into the Service and checking or unchecking the relevant boxes to adjust your account profile’s user preferences, or by sending us an email with your request to [hello@museapp.com](mailto:hello@museapp.com). You may also opt-out of further marketing communications by replying to any promotional email we have sent you or following the opt-out links on that message.

Our Service may, from time to time, contain links to and from the Services of our partner networks, advertisers, and affiliates, or include plug-ins enabling third-party features. If you follow a link to any third-party Service or engage a third-party plug-in, please note that these third parties have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these third parties.

We cannot delete your personal data except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change or delete information if we believe the change or deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or negatively impact the information’s accuracy.

If you delete your User Contributions from the Service, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or because other Service users may have copied or stored them. Our terms of use [https://museapp.com/terms](https://museapp.com/terms) govern proper access and use of information provided on the Service, including User Contributions.

Data Security

We store all personal data you provide to us behind firewalls on servers employing security protections.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you a login code for access to certain parts of our Service, you are responsible for keeping this code confidential. We ask you not to share your code with anyone.

Children’s Online Privacy

We do not direct our Service to minors and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16. If we learn we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected or received personal data from a child without appropriate consent, we will delete it.
