**Collection and further processing of personal data as well as type and purpose of processing**

In the following sections, we shall explain how, to what extent and for which purposes we collect your personal data. You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide us with your personal data. As a matter of principle, we only collect personal data to the extent necessary to provide a functioning website, to deliver website content and to perform our services, in particular our duties as a university towards students, cooperation partners and partner universities. However, it may be necessary to process certain types of data in order to comply with statutory provisions (e.g. higher education laws, tax regulations, German Anti-Money Laundering Act).

In the following, we set out which personal information we collect in this way and how we use it.

#### **1\. Processing of your personal data when you visit our website**

When you visit our website for information purposes, we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we will collect the following data on the grounds of legitimate interests to the extent that it is technically absolutely necessary in order for us to display our website to you and to ensure stability and security (the legal basis is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 point (f) GDPR):

IP address, date and time the website is accessed, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), content of the request (specific page), access status/HTTP status code, amount of data transferred in each case, website from which the user’s system accessed our website, browser, operating system and its interface, language and version of the browser software.

The data is stored in log files and is not merged with other data. The data is regularly deleted no later than three months after the website is accessed.

#### **2\. Contact form(s)**

For enquiries of all kinds, we offer you the possibility to contact us using a form provided on the website. You can also contact us by email or phone. Should you contact us, the information you provide (e.g. in the entry mask) will be transmitted to us and stored.

If you are able to register on our website (via your personal login area, giving you access to additional functions), registration is required in order to access certain contents and services on our website or for the fulfilment of a contract or the performance of precontractual measures.

The processing of the personal data provided by you when contacting us or registering serves to establish contact quickly and thus to promptly process your enquiry and provide our services. The legal basis is Art 6 (1) point (f) GDPR and/or your consent in accordance with Art 6 (1) point (a) GDPR. If you contact us with the aim to conclude a legal transaction, the additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 (1) point (b) GDPR.

#### **3\. Information via newsletter**

When you register to receive our email newsletter, we use your email address to send you our newsletter on a regular basis. To receive the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide an email address. The legal basis is your voluntary consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point (a) GDPR.

To send the newsletter, we use the services provider Newsletter2Go (Sendinblue), with which we have concluded an external processing agreement to ensure maximum protection of your personal data.

You can unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time, for example by clicking on the unsubscribe link that appears at the bottom of every newsletter. Alternatively, you can also send your unsubscribe request by email at any time to the email address given in our legal notice.

#### **4\. Cookies**

By changing the settings in your Internet browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies. Stored cookies can be deleted at any time, also automatically. However, if you deactivate cookies for our website, you may no longer be able to access all functions of the website to their full extent.

#### **5\. Integration of YouTube videos**

A web service of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre, 94043 Mountain View, USA (hereinafter: YouTube) is downloaded to our website. We use this data to ensure the full functionality of our website and to provide you with information. In this context, your browser may transmit personal data to YouTube. The legal basis relating to data processing is Art. 6 (1) point (f) GDPR.

Matomo uses cookies. The information about usage obtained by the cookie is transmitted to us and stored to enable us to evaluate usage behaviour.

This analysis allows us to optimise our Internet site and further adapt our services to reflect users’ needs.

#### **8\. Social media accounts**

We operate social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn. To this end, we set links on our website (e.g. via the corresponding icons). Provided you do not click on the link, no data is transmitted to the social media platform. Clicking on a link will take you to the corresponding social media platform, which will then collect certain personal data.

If you are additionally logged into a social media platform when you visit our website, the respective platform may be able to assign your visit to our website to your profile. Social media platforms may use user data for commercial purposes. In principle, we have no influence on the collection and further processing of personal data by the social media platforms, in particular the scope, location and duration of storage.

For all questions regarding data protection in connection with social media platforms, you can contact us directly; for technical questions, please contact the respective platform operator.

#### **9\. Erasure of data**

Unless otherwise stated in this privacy statement, personal data will be deleted immediately once the purpose for which it was collected has ceased to apply and provided that no retention periods (e.g. 10-year retention period under tax law with regard to all data relevant to the taxation matter or 6-year retention period under commercial law) conflict with this. We may also be entitled to retain the data for other reasons beyond fulfilment of the original purpose, including limitation periods for claims or for the purpose of legal prosecution.

The personal data collected by us during all requests for information will be routinely deleted after your enquiry has been processed, unless legitimate interests require longer storage (e.g. planned further requests for information, etc.). If your enquiry leads to the conclusion of a contract, your data will be deleted immediately after the expiry of limitation periods and the statutory retention periods.

Recipients of the data may also be service providers on whose services we rely for the operation of our organisation (e.g. technical service providers for the maintenance of the software and IT landscape, hosting providers) and for the fulfilment of our contractual obligations. These service providers process your data in our name as external data processors and are obliged to treat the data with the utmost confidentiality.
