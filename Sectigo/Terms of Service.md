**Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

These Terms of Use and any disputes relating to the Site provided hereunder shall be governed and interpreted according to each of the following laws, respectively, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions: (a) the laws of the State of New Jersey, if you are located in North America; or (b) the laws of England and Wales, if you are located outside of North America. The parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the courts of New Jersey if you are located in North America, or (b) the courts of England and Wales if you are located outside of North America, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

**Binding Arbitration**

(i) Purpose. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Sectigo regarding any Site provided, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section (with the exception of

the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a Dispute with Sectigo or any of Sectigo’s officers, directors, employees, attorneys and agents that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time-frame described in the Notice of Dispute clause below, other than those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration clause, you and Sectigo agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Section, and not litigate any Dispute in court. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.

(ii) Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND SECTIGO AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY EITHER PARTY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND ANY CLAIM FOR AMOUNTS OWED FOR USE OF THE SITE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.

(iii) Notice of Dispute. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH SECTIGO, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO SECTIGO TO GIVE SECTIGO THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or Sectigo may pursue the claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section.

(iv) Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SECTIGO SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOUR PARTICIPATION AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION FILED ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 20, 2011.

(v) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or Sectigo elects to resolve the Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.

(vi) Arbitration Procedures. Because the Site provided to you by Sectigo concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes **(“Supplementary Procedures”)** shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules, and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if a claim does not exceed $75,000 and you provide notice to and negotiated in good faith with Sectigo as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to you or Sectigo. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

(vii) Location of Arbitration. All claims for arbitration shall be submitted to and heard by the office of AAA located in the State of New Jersey. Should an evidentiary hearing be required by the Arbitrator, such hearing shall be heard in the State of New Jersey.

(viii) Severability. If any clause within this Section (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section, and the remainder of this Section will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court and both parties each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.

(ix) Right To Opt Out Of Binding Arbitration And Class Action Waiver Within 30 Days. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY SECTIGO IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE EITHER (A) SENT VIA EMAIL TO [\[email protected\]](https://www.sectigo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) OR (B) MAILED TO SECTIGO AT: 5 BECKER FARM ROAD, SUITE 300, ROSELAND, NJ 07068, USA, ATTN: GENERAL COUNSEL. IN EITHER CASE YOU MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, AND (3) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH SECTIGO THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION.

(x) Continuation. This Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

**Limitation on Time to File Claims**

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

**Rights of Third Parties**

There are no third party beneficiaries under this Agreement. No third party shall have any rights to bring a claim under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 in respect of these Terms of Use.

**Waiver and Severability**

No waiver by Sectigo of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Sectigo to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

**Force Majeure**

Neither party hereto shall be liable for any breach of its obligations hereunder resulting from any event not under the reasonable control of that party. The parties agree that the availability of the Internet and connections made through the Internet are not within the reasonable control of either party.

**Entire Agreement**

These Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Sectigo regarding the Site and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Site.
