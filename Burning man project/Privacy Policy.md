We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to maintain and improve our Site’s technical performance. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our Site, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of service, available at [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html), and the Google Privacy Policy, available at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

In general, we cannot guarantee your anonymity whenever you interact with our Site.

Please note that our Site may contain links to third-party websites. These third-party websites may send their own cookies to collect data and solicit Personal Information. Therefore, we cannot guarantee your privacy when visiting such third-party sites, nor the accuracy or acceptability of any services provided by such third parties.
