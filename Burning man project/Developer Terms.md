Terms of Service for Burning Man APIs and Datasets
==================================================

Thank you very much for your interest in creating an application for use by participants attending the Burning Man event. Black Rock City LLC (“BRC”) makes some event-related APIs and datasets (collectively the “Event Data”) available for use by community developers. The Event Data represent information already publicly available on Burning Man websites, along with additional data provided by Burning Man theme camps, artists, and other participants who have opted to have their data made available for your innovative efforts. By accessing the Event Data, you agree to the following Terms of Service Agreement (“Agreement”).

This Agreement sets out legally binding terms governing your use of the Event Data. These terms may be modified by BRC at any time and without prior notice. Such modifications are effective upon publication by BRC. You can always review the most current version of the Terms of Service at [http://innovate.burningman.org/terms-of-service-for-burning-man-apis-and-datasets/](http://innovate.burningman.org/terms-of-service-for-burning-man-apis-and-datasets/).

1. **Eligibility****.** You must be age thirteen or over to access or request access to the Event Data. Use of the Event Data is void where prohibited. By accessing or requesting access to the Event Data, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement, and you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2. **Use of Event Data****.**
    1. You may use the Event Data in connection with a noncommercial website or software application (“App”), developed by you and aimed at providing useful services to the Burning Man community, only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the [Burning Man Privacy Policy](http://burningman.org/privacy-policy/), the [Ten Principles of Burning Man](http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/), and the Keys assigned to you by BRC (as described in Section 5). Examples of useful services include without limitation Burning Man event listings, artwork listings, rideshares, a Burner glossary, and driving directions to the event.
    2. You agree that your App will not include any obscene or adult content or references to illegal activities, and will reflect positively on Burning Man, Burning Man-related entities, and the Burning Man community.
    3. If you develop a mobile App, you agree to notify your users during the installation process about any permissions your App is seeking, including without limitation location data or camera access.

3. **No Commercial Use****.**
    1. You agree not to use the Event Data for advertising or any other commercial or promotional purpose, including without limitation the creation of commercial products, product guides, or tools, or the promotion of events or activities outside the Burning Man event.
    2. In keeping with Burning Man’s Gifting Principle, you agree that your App will be made available to participants and other interested users **free of charge**.

4. **Disclaimer****.** You agree to include the following disclaimer in a prominent location in your App and on any webpage on which your App may be downloaded: **“This app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Burning Man Project or Black Rock City LLC.”**

5. **API Key Policies****.**
    1. Some of the Event Data is accessible only with an API access key. To access this Event Data, you must register for an API key. BRC will issue you unique, revocable security keys, tokens, passwords and/or other credentials (collectively, “Keys”) for accessing certain Data. You may only access the Event Data with the Keys issued to you, and you may not solicit another developer’s Keys or consumer data. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose your Keys to any other party or use them with any other application other than that for which you initially applied. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Keys. **You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using your Keys**, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by you or a third party.
    2. You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the API Key registration form. You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate registration information (including a current email address and other required contact information) with BRC. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete; if BRC has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or that you are otherwise in violation of this Agreement; or if you do not respond to communications directed to you by BRC, BRC has the right to revoke your Keys and refuse any and all current or future use of Event Data (or any portion thereof).
    3. BRC may also revoke your Keys if you fail to inform end users of any geotag or location data disclosed by your App, or if you republish Event Data or other Burning Man content not accessed through the API or tools that BRC may provide.
    4. Access to the API and Event Data may not always be available. BRC may monitor the use of its API and Event Data to ensure quality and verify your compliance. You agree that you will not interfere with such monitoring.

6. **Confidentiality****.**
    1. You agree that you will not disclose Your Keys to any third party except your responsible employees or agent using such information solely on your behalf in accordance with this Agreement and under a written duty of confidentiality.
    2.

You agree that you will not make the Location Data available for theme camps to users of your App until 12:01am on the Sunday of the week before the first day of the Burning Man event.** Until such time, the Location Data shall be BRC’s confidential information (“Confidential Information”).
