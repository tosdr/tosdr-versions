Legal basis we rely on to collect information
---------------------------------------------

The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:

1. **To fulfil a service**: We use your information to execute contracts or services that you have entered into. This includes communications relating to your order, deliveries and payments via phone, email and SMS (for example to let you know if a delivery is delayed or payment has failed). In order to process and fulfil your order, we may need to share your information with our franchisees (eg delivery address) and payment processors (eg to collect payment).
2. **When you consent**: We may use your personal information and order history to tell you about relevant products, events, competitions and news. For example, when you sign up to a newsletter or tell us you want to hear from us by completing your preferences. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by contacting us at any time. If you change your mind you can update your choices at any time by logging into your account or contacting us.
3. **If we have legitimate interest**: The GDPR defines legitimate interest as a reasonable business or commercial interest for processing your personal information. For example, sending a direct mail when a product you previously ordered is back in season, improving the service we provide or to follow our ethical and environmental ethos.

How we use your information
---------------------------

**We want to help you Live Life on the Veg and get the most of organic and ethical living. By understanding our customers, trends and behaviours, we can provide better and more relevant service.**

If you wish to change how we use your data, you’ll find details in the ‘What are my rights?’ section below. Remember, if you choose not to share your personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide some services you’ve asked for.

    * To automatically customise the contents of our website, emails or other channels based on the data we hold about you (for example showing you strawberries if you previously purchased them)

Who we share your information with
----------------------------------

**Sometimes we may share your data with trusted third parties for the legal bases defined above (service, legitimate interest and consent).**

An additional basis of ‘**legal compliance**’ applies here. We have a duty to pass on information to law enforcement agencies, if we become aware of people involved in fraud, non-payment or other criminal activity.

We may also be legally bound to share your data in the future if Riverford is subject to sale or asset transfer.

Who we share your data with, how we protect it and your rights.
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Our business partners and franchisees in order to fulfil our contract with you. Data is accessed from centrally maintained systems. No personal information is sent across the open internet.
    
2. We use an external email platform provided by MAPP to fulfil our service and marketing communication needs. MAPP adheres to the GDPR when processing data for customers operating within the EU.
    
    Use of a third party email provider is necessary and legitimate for us to execute the service you sign up for with Riverford. MAPP provide the following statement about how your data is protected:
    
    Mapp applies effective security safeguards to protect your Personal Information and therefore complies with and is partly certified against ISO 27001.

    In accordance with the GDPR, Trustpilot automatically delete your personal details after 30 days. If you leave a review, Trustpilot becomes the controller of that information under the terms of their own [privacy policy](https://legal.trustpilot.com/end-user-privacy-terms).
    
4. Online advertisers and platforms such as (Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook) to show you relevant information about our products. The processing is completed using pseudonymised (subjected to a technical process which replaces your data with codes, so it is unidentifiable to anyone without additional information) email addresses to protect your privacy. This transfer is a bulk process so neither Riverford, or the third party, has sight of any individual’s data.

6. We use Facebook’s services to identify people similar to our current customers. This is the most cost-effective way for us to show Facebook users matching that profile messages about Riverford and gain new customers. The processing is completed using pseudonymised (subjected to a technical process which replaces your data with codes, so it is unidentifiable to anyone without additional information) email addresses to protect your privacy.

    As an ethical business that uses profits to invest back into protecting the environment, it is our legitimate interest to take all reasonable steps to acquire new customers whilst avoiding unnecessary cost.
    
7. We use Experian’s services to identify areas of the UK where we may find people similar to our current customers. This enables us to plan and optimise franchise and delivery areas to reduce cost and minimise impact on the environment. Information is shared via Experian’s secure document upload service. Experian protects your information over the internet by using a secure web server, which allows web browser programs to interact with Experian’s web server via an encrypted session.
    
8. Selected business partners you consent to hear from (for example when we run joint competitions with companies matching our ethics). If you enter a joint competition and tick a box agreeing that our partner can send you promotional information directly, we will share your information via the legal basis of consent which will be gained each time you enter a competition.
    
    The third party will have their own Privacy Policy
    

**We only provide third parties with the information they need to perform the exact services we specify in our contract with them and we never sell your data to third parties. We work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected at all times. If at any time we stop using third party services, any information held by them will either be deleted or rendered anonymous.**

Where we keep your information
------------------------------

The data that we collect from you is stored within the European Economic Area ("EEA"). We take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Where we share your data with third parties, that information may be held outside of the EU but remains under the jurisdiction and strict principles of the GDPR.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers, except payment card information. To maintain the highest level of security, we never store or have visibility of your card details. We use a method called client-side encryption to take your card details. This means that your card details are encrypted on your device before they are sent to Riverford. This encrypted data is sent to our payment provider (WorldPay) ensuring that we are never able to see your card details.

Our payment provider gives us a ‘token’ which can only be used to take payment from your card to a Riverford bank account. If this token were stolen, it would be of no value to anyone else; it can only be used by Riverford to take a payment from your card.

All transactions and communication between your browser and our website are encrypted using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol which is standard in modern web browsers. Where you have chosen a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Do not share your password with anyone and change it regularly.

From time to time, our website may contain links to third party websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they will have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

How long we keep your data for
------------------------------

We will hold your personal information on our system for as long as is necessary for the processing of our contractual obligations with you or when you give consent for us to keep your account open.

We keep your account open for a period of 37 months after your last order or last delivery. During this time, we will continue communicating with you as outlined by this policy unless you actively close your account or [update your preferences](https://www.riverford.co.uk/account).

At 36 months after your last order, we will email you to check if you’d like to keep your account open and continue hearing from us. If you do not respond, we will remove your details from our active database and you will no longer receive any communication from us. If your account is closed either as part of our retention or as a request under Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation your personal information will be held securely on a deactivated basis for the remainder of our legal obligations to meet government financial and audit regulations for a maximum of 7 years unless there is an extended legal basis to retain for longer. Should you wish to become a Riverford customer in the future, you will be prompted to set up a new account.
