Charitable Allies is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) charity, legal aid law firm organized and operated to provide legal services for nonprofits at half or less than half of fair market value and to provide free and low cost  legal education and resources for nonprofit organizations. This Privacy Policy explains how we protect your privacy when you use this Site.

This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms of Use that govern your use of this Site (our “Terms of Use”). You may review our Terms of Use by clicking on the link at the bottom of each page of this Site.

### Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers the “personal information” we collect through this Site. “Personal information” is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.

### Your Consent

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using this Site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you may not use this Site.

### Privacy Notices

This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted on this Site. Generally, privacy notices provide details about the personal information we collect on particular pages or particular areas of this Site, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use or share that information. Our privacy notices are part of this Privacy Policy.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or revise this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version on this Site. The changes will be effective as of the date we post the revised version on this Site. They will apply only to the personal information we collect after we have posted the revised version.

### What Personal Information Do We Collect Through This Site?

_Information You Provide._ We collect the personal information you knowingly provide (using your mouse and keyboard) when you use this Site. The information we collect depends on how you use this Site.

_Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser, In General._ We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet Service Provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. An “IP address” is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. It is used to identify your computer’s “location” in cyberspace, so that the information you request can be delivered to you. If you use a dial-up connection or a connection that assigns dynamic IP addresses, your computer will be assigned a new IP Address each time you connect to the Internet. If, however, your computer is permanently connected to the Internet using a static IP address, the IP address assigned to your computer will generally be the same each time you use your computer. Although it does not identify you by name, we treat your IP address as your personal information.

Generally, we do not link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you by name. You should know, however, that when you access this Site by clicking on a link in an electronic communication you receive from us, your browser tells us that someone has clicked on a particular link in that particular electronic communication. We use this information to improve our marketing efforts. In addition, we review our server logs — which contain visitors’ IP addresses — for security and fraud prevention purposes. If criminal activity is suspected, we may share our server logs and the personal information we have collected through this Site with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.

_Cookies and Similar Technologies._ We use “cookies” and other Web technologies for a number of purposes, including

* to collect information about the ways visitors use this Site — for example, which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;
* to support the features and functionality of this Site — for example, to save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits to this Site; and
* to personalize your experience when you use this Site.

Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally. If, however, you have created a user identity, for example, by subscribing to our publications, we may link the information we collect using Web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave this Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit this Site, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Site if you set your browser to reject cookies.

### How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect Through This Site?

Generally, we use the personal information we collect through this Site:

* to provide the information and services you request;
* to personalize your experience when you use this Site;
* to personalize our communications with you;
* to contact you with other information and/or services that we believe will be of interest to you (unless you have chosen not to receive these communications);
* to contact you with information and notices related to your use of this Site;
* to submit information to our potential donors in our search to provide you with low-cost or pro-bono legal assistance;
* to invite you to participate in surveys and provide feedback to us (unless you have chosen not to receive such invitations);
* to make sure our mailing lists are accurate, current and do not contain multiple entries for the same individual;
* to better understand your needs and interests;
* to improve the content, functionality and usability of this Site;
* to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; and
* for security and fraud-prevention purposes.

_“Email” Features._ This Site may contain features that allow you to forward information and personal messages to a colleague. When you use one of these features, we will ask you to provide your name and email address and your colleague’s name and email address. We use this information only to customize and deliver your message. We do not store this information in our databases after your email is delivered.

_Employment Information._ You may use this Site to search for job openings at Charitable Allies. When you use this Site to apply for a job, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, educational background and employment history. You may also send us your résumé and other information relating to your job search or application. We use this information only for recruiting and employment purposes; we do not use it for marketing purposes. If you are hired by Charitable Allies, the information you provide during the recruiting process will become part of our employee records.

_Form Fill Features_. You may use the site to submit forms, sign up for newsletters, and otherwise submit information to us for our use in answering your questions, pursuing an attorney-client relationship with you, enrolling you in our newsletter submission, and in otherwise communicating with you. 

### How Do We Share Your Personal Information? 

_Service Providers._ We may share your personal information with companies that perform services on our behalf, such as credit card verification, online recruiting, and Web hosting service providers.

_Co-Sponsored Events._ Depending on your privacy preferences, we may contact you with information about seminars and other events sponsored by Charitable Allies. Some of these events may be co-sponsored with other organizations. In such cases, we may lend our mailing list to a co-sponsor so that all of the communications regarding the event can be processed centrally.

_Compliance With Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others._ We may disclose personal information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a legal obligation. We may also disclose personal information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.

_Successors in Interest._ Your personal information may be transferred to another law firm that succeeds to all or part of our business, for example, if we reorganize our partnership structure or transfer a significant portion of our assets or personnel to another firm. In such event, your personal information will continue to be protected by this Privacy Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

### Your Choices

_In General._ We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. In most cases, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time we collect your personal information.

_Direct Marketing._ We will not use your personal information for direct marketing purposes, without your consent. Generally, we will include an “opt-out” link in electronic newsletters and promotional emails we send you, so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future. If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing lists, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. Please provide your full name, company name, postal address and email address so that we can locate you on our mailing lists. We will honor your request within a reasonable period of time and, in any event, within the time limits established by law.

### How Can You Access, Update or Correct Your Personal Information?

If you wish to access, update or correct your personal information, please contact us by email at info@CharitableAllies.org or postal mail at Charitable Allies, Inc., 9100 Purdue Rd, Ste. 115, Indianapolis, IN 46268. We will respond to you within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide access and correct or delete any inaccurate information you discover. In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to verify your identity. We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to charge a reasonable fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the personal information we hold about you.

### Security

We take reasonable precautions to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information we collect. Although we use reasonable measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized use or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet or stored in our databases. Your transmissions are, therefore, at your own risk.

### Supplemental Information

From time to time, we may supplement the personal information we collect through this Site with information from other sources, including information we collect from you through other channels. For example, if you provide us with contact information when you attend one of our seminars, we may use that information to update the contact information collected through this Site.

### Our Other Web Sites
