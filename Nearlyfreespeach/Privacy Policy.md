We will not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Ever. Period. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party without your prior consent unless legally compelled to do so. We will attempt to notify you any time we are forced to disclose your personally identifiable information unless we are legally prevented from doing so.

We will cooperate with all investigations conducted by law enforcement authorities of the United States of America when legally required to do so. Cooperation with law enforcement authorities from other countries and cooperation when it is not legally required are at our sole discretion. Our discretion looks favorably on freedom and justice, and unfavorably on oppression and violence. Unless legally prohibited, we will inform you of any cooperation we provide to any law enforcement authorities.

We will not use your personally identifiable information to market our products and services to you unless you specifically indicate you wish us to do so. And probably not even then. We will not use your personally identifiable information to market third party products and services to you.

If for any reason you terminate your service, we will destroy active records containing your personally identifiable information as soon as it is reasonable to do so. Some information may continue to exist in our archived records. If we terminate your service, we may retain enough information to prevent you from signing up for service in the future.
