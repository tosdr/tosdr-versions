pronoundb.org automatically receives and collects various metadata sent by your web browser: IP address, browser information, operating system information, timestamp of your visits, pages visited. This data is only kept for seven days and is only used for debugging, troubleshooting and counter-abuse purposes. None of this data, or any other data we may collect, will be ever sold to anyone.

In the event one or more users are found to abuse the pronoundb.org website, we reserve the right to indefinitely store IP addresses and various other metadata for counter-abuse. We also reserve the right to store aggregated and non-personal information about how the service is used, in the intent to improve it.

pronoundb.org lets you connect to external accounts using the OAuth authentication standard. When connecting an external account, pronoundb.org will collect the external account's unique identifier, as well as the account's display name on the external platform. You may require the removal of this data directly on the website, at any time.

You may during your use of pronoundb.org be invited to input personal information, such as for example regarding your gender identity. By submitting any information on the website, you consent to your data to be stored, processed and redistributed by pronoundb.org to provide its service. You can update or remove any information at any time on the website.

pronoundb.org allows third parties to use identifiers from external platform to lookup information about you. This includes any information you've entered, excluding other external accounts you linked. Third parties will not be able to directly enumerate external accounts owned by a single person.

pronoundb.org may distribute aggregated information, such as the total user count or some statistics about website usage, or percentages about the user repartition. In all cases, pronoundb.org will never specify who is or may be included in aggregated information.

You may request the entire removal of your data from pronoundb.org's servers by deleting your account. Your data will be deleted immediately, but may still live for an additional thirty days on our servers in the form of database backups that are kept to protect the service from data loss.

These policies may be revised at any time and your continued use of the service will be regarded as acceptance of the new policies.
