### Product description

Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of this Application and are subject to change without notice.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.

### Purchasing process

Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

* Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.
* After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.

### Order submission

When the User submits an order, the following applies:

* The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
* In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
* Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.

All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.

### Prices

Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.

Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Application.

All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Application does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.

If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.

### Purchase via app store

### Retention of usage rights

Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.

### Delivery

The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on this Application or as communicated before the order submission.

The trial period shall end automatically and shall not convert into any paid Product unless the User actively purchases such paid Product.

#### Subscriptions

Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over a determined period of time.

User rights
-----------

### Right of withdrawal

Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.

#### Who the right of withdrawal applies to

Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.

Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.

#### Exercising the right of withdrawal

To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.

To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.

When does the withdrawal period expire?

* **Regarding the purchase of a service**, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.

#### Effects of withdrawal

Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.

However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.

Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.

##### …on the purchase of services

Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.

Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.

Guarantees
----------

### Best-price-guarantee

The Owner grants Users a contractual best-price-guarantee. If after purchasing any of the Products available on this Application they retrieve the exact same Product with the exact same specifications and conditions at a lower price from another Provider, the Owner will refund the difference upon presentation of appropriate evidence.

The best-price-guarantee is subject to the following conditions:

* Users have purchased a Product from the Owner;
* On the same day, after having purchased the Product from the Owner, Users find the same product available for purchase at a lower price from a different online provider;
* The product’s specifications and characteristics, such as quantity, time, territorial scope, purpose, brand, etc. are identical to the Product purchased from the Owner;
* The purchase price of the aforementioned product is lower than that of the Product purchased from the Owner. To this end, any personal price reduction resulting from a Coupon or discount code of Users as well as any temporary price reduction, such as in case of a sales, shall not be considered, i.e. the purchase price must already be lower before any such reduction is applied.

In order to claim the best-price-guarantee Users must:

* Store screenshots of and link to the lower-priced offer, making sure that all relevant product specifications and characteristics, date, and time are visible on such screenshots, as well as under such links. Users must also save a screenshot of the last page before purchase confirmation;
* Submit the afore-mentioned information to the Owner alongside their full purchase reference relating to the Product purchased from the Owner (such as name, last name, address, email address, booking or order no. etc.) within the same day.

The Owner shall then verify that all best-price-guarantee conditions and requirements are fulfilled and, if so, refund the difference between the price paid to the Owner and the lower price of the other provider’s offer.

### Money-back-guarantee for goods

Without prejudice to any applicable statutory rights, the Owner grants Users the right to cancel a purchase they are unsatisfied with, and obtain a refund, within 30 days from the day on which the purchased goods have been delivered.

The Owner shall refund the price of the Product purchased using the same payment method as the original transaction.  
In order to make use of this right, Users must send an unambiguous notice to the Owner. While a motivation is not required, Users are kindly asked to specify the reason why they are claiming the money-back-guarantee.

Within the same period of time stated above, Users must also return the purchased goods to the Owner at their own expense, making sure that they are undamaged, clean and fit for resale. Goods must be returned inside the original packaging.  
Upon receipt of the goods, the Owner will verify that all conditions applicable to the money-back-guarantee are fulfilled and, if so, refund the purchase price.

### Money-back-guarantee for services

Without prejudice to any applicable statutory rights, the Owner grants Users the right to cancel the purchase of a service they are unsatisfied with, and obtain a refund, within 30 days from the day on which the contract was entered into.

The Owner shall refund the price of the Product purchased using the same payment method as the original transaction.  
In order to make use of this right, Users must send an unambiguous notice to the Owner. While a motivation is not required, Users are kindly asked to specify the reason why they are claiming the money-back-guarantee.

Upon receipt of such notice, the Owner will verify that all conditions applicable to the money-back-guarantee are fulfilled and, if so, refund the purchase price. In this case, Users will no longer have access to the purchased service.
