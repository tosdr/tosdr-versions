1\. Information on how we use cookies
-------------------------------------

Our Vectary website (“website” or “Site”) uses various cookies which allow us to distinguish you from other users of our Site, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Site and also allows us to improve our Site.  
  
A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information.  
  
We use cookies to personalize content and ads to provide social media features and to analyze our traffic. We also share information about use of our Site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services.  
  
The purpose of using Cookies is to be able to adapt to your needs, to distinguish you from other users, to prevent the display of irrelevant ads in your web browser and to prevent the need for your repeated login to our Interface.  
  
You do not need to allow cookies to visit most of the Site. However, enabling cookies may allow for a more tailored browsing experience and is required for certain parts of the Site to work. In the majority of cases, a cookie does not provide us with any of your personal information.

2\. Information on the cookies we use
-------------------------------------

Cookies may be either “first-party”, “third-party”, “persistent“ or ”session” cookies:  
‍  
**First-party cookies** are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g. cookies placed by www.vectary.com).  
‍  
**Third-party cookies** are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.  
‍  
**Persistent cookies** are cookies that remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.  
‍  
**Session cookies** are cookies that allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

Strictly necessary cookies do not require your consent.  
  
For performance, functional and targeting cookies, we request your consent before placing them on your device. You can give your consent by clicking on the appropriate button on the banner displayed to you.

6\. What cookies do we use and why?
-----------------------------------

We use “necessary”, “performance”, “functional” and “targeting” cookies:  
  
**6.1. Strictly Necessary cookies:**  
  
These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.  
  
We use these Strictly Necessary cookies to identify you as being logged in to the website and to authenticate you, to make sure you connect to the right service on the website when we make any changes to the way it works and for security purposes.  
‍  
**6.2. Performance cookies:**   
  
These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site and gather information on error messages. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our Site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.  
  
We use performance cookies to perform web analytics and for error management purposes, by measuring any errors that may occur.  
  
For example, Vectary also uses a third-party software service, Google Analytics, to capture and analyze standard website usage information. This service supplies us with additional non-personally indirectly identifiable information about Vectary's Site users to help us create content that our users may find useful. Users who wish to have their non-personally indirectly identifiable information not collected by means of their visit to the Vectary Site have the option to opt-out of the Google Analytics tracking service. In any event, our website users can refuse performance, targeting and marketing cookies at any time by following the instructions.  
  
**6.3. Functional cookies:**  
  
These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.  
  
We use functional cookies to enable us to provide you with enhanced functionality and personalisation. These cookies may be set by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.  
  
**6.4. Targeting and marketing cookies:**  
  
These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose. These cookies may be set through our Site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other Sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.  
  
For example, Vectary uses pixel tracking via social media platform, LinkedIn. Pixel tracking is a marketing pixel graphic used to track user behavior, site conversions, web traffic and other web usage metrics. It allows personalization and retargeting of information, based on users’ web device types and interests. Data collected by this site and through pixel tracking include website visitors’ IP address, device, browser characteristics, time-based data elements, and URL visited.   

7\. Retention
-------------

A cookie or similar technology will exist for different periods of time depending on the purpose of the cookie. For example, a session cookie which enables the website to operate will only exist on your device whilst you browse our website but other cookies will remain on your device for longer such as some functionality cookies which need to stay on your device so that the website can recognize you when you return.  
  
For more information about how long a cookie remains on your device, please see the Cookie Settings.  

8\. Keeping our cookie policy up to date
----------------------------------------

We may need to update our cookie policy from time to time if we decide to use cookies differently. Any changes will be updated here.
