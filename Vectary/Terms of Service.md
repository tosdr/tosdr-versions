If you are using a Pro Account, you must provide Vectary with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) (**“Payment Provider”**), as a condition to signing up for Services for which we charge. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities.

If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current Subscription Term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires and you will be rolled back to a Free Account thereafter.  However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Paddle to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period.  Upon renewal of your subscription, if Paddle does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that Vectary may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).  
  
**9.3**  **Taxes.** Prices displayed on any Service are inclusive of any applicable sales tax, value added tax (VAT) or similar at the rate that is in force from time to time.   
  
**9.4  Refunds.** If you are a consumer and have your habitual residence in the European Union or the United Kingdom, you have the right to cancel your purchase of any subscription without reason within fourteen (14) days of the initial purchase and request a refund of the relevant Service Subscription Fee.

In order to request a refund, please inform us via email by an unequivocal statement (e.g., email in the following form: “Vectary Inc., e-mail: [support@vectary.com](mailto:support@vectary.com). I/We hereby give notice that I/We (\*) hereby withdraw from the following Paid Account: \[insert applicable Paid Account\].” Any refund will be issued to the same payment method used for the relevant purchase.

You agree to immediately notify Paddle of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder. By making payments through the Services, you agree to be bound by Paddle’s Privacy Policy and hereby consent and authorize Vectary and Paddle to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more third-party providers to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.  
  
**9.6**  **Upgrades.** The cumulative views on Projects in your Workspace in any given month may not exceed the number set forth on Vectary’s Pricing Page (“**View Limit**”). If such number of cumulative views exceeds the applicable View Limit, Vectary may, in Vectary’s sole discretion, require you to upgrade your Workspace. If you choose to upgrade your Workspace, such upgrade will take effect immediately and any incremental fees associated with such upgrade will be charged in accordance with this Agreement. If you do not choose to upgrade your Workspace, Vectary may stop displaying your Public Projects from that Workspace for the applicable month.  
  
**9.7 Free Trials and Other Promotions.**  Certain subscription offerings may be available on a free trial basis (a “**Free Trial**”), the period of which will be communicated to you via the Services.  Unless otherwise expressly set forth, your use of any such subscription offerings will expire at the end of the Free Trial, and any further use of such offerings is prohibited unless you purchase a subscription to such offerings.  Your Free Trial will automatically convert to a paid Subscription and your Payment Provider will be charged for the applicable subscription at the end of your Free Trial unless you cancel the subscription in accordance with Section 9.2 before the Free Trial ends.  If you fail to cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends, you will be responsible for payment for the full Subscription Term.  Unless otherwise expressly stated, any free trial or other promotion that provides a Registered User access to the Services must be used within the specified time of the trial  

_If you purchase any Paid Account, you will be charged a monthly or annual Subscription Fee (as applicable), which you agree will be automatically charged with the payment information provided to Paddle at the beginning of each Subscription Period until you cancel._

14\. Dispute Resolution
-----------------------

**_Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Vectary and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us._**  
  
**14.1  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement**_._ You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of any of the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with Vectary, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Vectary may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  **This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.**    
  
**14.2  Arbitration Rules and Forum**_._ The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent: National Registered Agents, Inc., 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Vectary will pay them for you.  In addition, Vectary will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
  
**14.3  Authority of Arbitrator**.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Vectary.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  
  
**14.4**  **Waiver of Jury Trial**.  YOU AND VECTARY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Vectary are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 14.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.    
  
**14.5**  **Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief**.  ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of Delaware.  All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.    
  
**14.6**  **30-Day Right to Opt Out**. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: [contact@vectary.com](mailto:contact@vectary.com), within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Vectary username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Vectary account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.    If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.  
  
**14.7  Severability**_._ Except as provided in Section 14.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  
  
**14.8**  **Survival of Agreement**_._ This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Vectary.  
  
**14.9  Modification**.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Vectary makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Vectary at the following address: Vectary, Inc., [contact@vectary.com](http://contact@vectary.com/).  

_We will use arbitration to resolve any claims between us, and you cannot join a class action lawsuit or obtain a jury trial for any disputes you have with us related to the use of the website and Services._

15\. General
------------

**15.1  Electronic Communications.**  The communications between you and Vectary may take place via electronic means, whether you visit any of the Services or send Vectary e-mails, or whether Vectary posts notices on the Website or other Services or communicates with you via e-mail.  For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Vectary in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Vectary provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing.  The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq. (“**E-Sign**”).  
  
**15.2  Notice.**  Where Vectary requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Vectary with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Vectary is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the Agreement, Vectary’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.      
  
**15.3  Relationship of Parties.**  The parties hereto are independent contractors.  Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to create an agency, employment, partnership, fiduciary or joint venture relationship between the parties.  
  
**15.4**  **Publicity.**  Vectary may use your name and a description of your use of the Services for investor relations and marketing purposes.  
  
**15.5  International Users**.  The Services can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to Services and content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that Vectary intends to announce such Services or content in your country. Vectary makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in your country or any other countries. Those who access or use the Services do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.  
  
**15.6**  **Compliance with Export Control Laws.**  The Services may contain encryption technology controlled under U.S. export law, the export of which may require an export license from the U.S. Commerce Department.  You will comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Vectary from and against all fines, penalties, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Vectary as a result of your breach of this Section 15.6.  
  
**15.7  Assignment.**  You may not assign or transfer, by operation of law, merger, change of control, or otherwise, any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement (including its licenses and rights in connection with the Services) to any third party without Vectary’s prior written consent.  Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Vectary may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement.  
**15.8**  **Governing Law and Venue.**  This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflict of law provisions that would require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.  Any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in a federal or state court located in the State of Delaware.  Each party irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agrees to service of process issued by, any such court. IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER AND HAVE YOUR HABITUAL RESIDENCE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR THE UNITED KINGDOM, YOU MAY BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTION AFFORDED TO YOU BY MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF THE LAW OF YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE, AND NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AFFECT THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTION.  
  
**15.9**  **Force Majeure.**  Any delay in or failure of performance by either party under this Agreement, other than a failure to pay amounts when due, will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent caused by any occurrence beyond the reasonable control of such party, including acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.  
  
**15.10**  **Remedies.**  Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the parties’ rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative.  You acknowledge that the Services contains valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Vectary, that any actual or threatened breach of Sections 1.2 or 1.3 will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to Vectary for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.    
  
**15.11**  **Waiver; Severability.**  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.  If any provision of this Agreement is adjudicated to be unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.  
  
**15.12**  **Construction.**  The Section headings of this Agreement are for convenience and will not be used to interpret this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the word “including” means “including but not limited to.”  
  
**15.13**  **Entire Agreement**. The Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.  

_You consent to receiving electronic communications. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of Delaware. Any dispute resolution will occur in Delaware. If any part of this Agreement is not enforceable, the rest of the Agreement remains in effect. This Agreement alone controls our relationship._
