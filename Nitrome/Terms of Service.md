**8 USE OF COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL IN VIDEO FOOTAGE AND FAN MADE WORK**

Generally Nitrome Limited does not object to fans using materials for non-commercial use.

Nitrome Limited does reserve the right to have its copyrighted material taken down at any time. If you have further questions or concerns, please contact [support@nitrome.com](mailto:support@nitrome.com)

We’re happy for fans to upload footage of their gameplay - we love seeing Lets Plays, Walkthoughs and humorous or artistic interpretations of our games, characters or brand. We even feature some of this work on our site from time to time in the Nitrome Blog, Nitrome Facebook and Nitrome Twitter accounts. We are also happy to allow the use of Advertising within footage on video sharing sites for self profit. We do have just a few guidelines that we ask you to follow if you are going to post or stream on video sharing sites.

To make our position on this subject easier to understand, we have put together a list of content that, if posted, might result in a take-down notice:

* Pre-Release Footage: No pre-release leaked footage of any kind: Any posting of in-game footage from leaked copies of the game prior to its official release date without written concent may be taken down, regardless of how the game was obtained.
* Videos where the poster is posing as Nitrome or claiming ownership of the material in the video being shown.
* Exact duplication of official launch videos.

We do reserve the right to remove content we find objectionable on a case by case basis & to change our policy from time. We will report any changes on the Nitrome blog [www.nitrome.com/blog](https://www.nitrome.com/blog/)
