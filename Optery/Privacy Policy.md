#### **10.** **Your Data Protection Rights Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

If you are a resident of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights, covered by GDPR. – See more at [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB).

We enable you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.

#### **11.** **Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)**

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: [https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/](https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB).

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

(a) users can visit our site anonymously.

(b) our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website.

(c) users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.

(d) all users are able to change their personal information by updating the personal information fields of your Manage Profile page in your account.

Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:

We do not respond to Do Not Track signals.  Third-party technology providers we utilize for our Service may also not respond to Do Not Track signals.  Do Not Track is a preference setting some web browsers support to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.

You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.

#### **12. Your Data Protection Rights as a resident of any State in the United States, including California under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**

If you are a resident of any State in the United States, including California, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:

**(a) What personal information we have about you**. If you make this request, we will return to you:

      (i) The categories of personal information we have collected about you.

      (ii) The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.

      (iii) The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.

      (iv) The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.

      (v) The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

      (vi) A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with.

Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.

**(b) To delete your personal information**. If you want your personal information to be removed from our systems, you should delete your account from the Login & Security section of your Account page and all of the information we hold about you will be destroyed immediately. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of your information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate. To delete your personal information, you should delete your account from the Login & Security section of your Account page. If you do not have an active Account with us and are not subscribed to our email newsletter, we do not maintain any personal information about you.

An exception to the immediate deletion and de-identification of user data is by our payment processor service provider Stripe.  Stripe’s standard practice is to retain the customer’s purchase transaction data to be able to facilitate refund requests and process dispute claims that may arise after a paying customer has already deleted their Optery account.  In practice, this ensures customer’s refund and dispute claims are processed quickly and efficiently.  If customers wish to contact Stripe for data deletion requests directly, they can do so here: [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB)

 **(c)** **To stop selling your personal information**. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.

Please note, if you ask us to delete your data, it will impact your experience with us as several functions of our Service will not function without your personal information, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

To exercise your data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by one of the following means:

If you have an account active for our Service, you can delete your account from the Login & Security section of your Account page.

By email: [support@optery.com](mailto:support@optery.com?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB).

If you are a resident of California, your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA and/or the CPRA. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information website.
