#### **6.**¬†**Removal Services**

Our subscription plans provide services for submitting personal information opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression and removal requests to lists of third-party data brokers and information aggregators (‚Äú**Removal List(s)**‚Äù) on your behalf (‚Äú**Removal Service(s)**‚Äù).

Major changes to the Removal Services will be communicated to Optery‚Äôs registered users and Optery will provide such communication by sending an email notification to the primary email address of each affected Account.

You acknowledge and agree that (i) Optery, Inc. will use good faith, reasonable efforts to provide the Removal Services, but that there is no guarantee or warranty of any kind that third-parties will honor or comply with the opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression or removal requests, (ii) it is not possible for Optery, Inc. to remove 100% of your personal information from the Internet, or even from all of the data brokers and information aggregators in each Removal List, (iii) Removal Services will be provided for data broker profiles primarily representing you and will not be provided for data broker profiles primarily representing someone other than you, and (iv) it can sometimes take multiple months from your initial subscription plan purchase for third-parties to remove your personal information from their web site(s).

Optery, Inc. also offers a Limited Power of Attorney document that can be electronically signed for the purpose of appointing Optery as your Authorized Agent for submitting your data rights requests. When that document is signed, its terms supersede the Authorized Agent terms included in these Terms of Service.

#### **8.**¬†**Free Trial**

Optery, Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (‚Äú**Free Trial**‚Äù).¬† However, at this time, Optery, Inc. does not offer a Free Trial.

If Optery, Inc. does begin offering a Free Trial in the future, you may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by¬†Optery, Inc.¬†until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

Optery, Inc.¬†will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate or change your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

#### **10.¬†Refunds**

**a. For Subscriptions**

We issue refunds for contracts within thirty (30) days of the original contract purchase. To qualify for a refund, you must cancel your subscription renewal within this thirty-day period. Please note, as there is only one original purchase per contract, we cannot honor multiple refund requests for the same account or individual. Upon issuing a refund, your plan will immediately revert to the Free Basic tier, and any remaining unused subscription time will be forfeited. You can cancel your plan through the ‚ÄúPlans & Billing‚Äù section on your Account page at [https://app.optery.com/account](https://app.optery.com/account), through your dashboard if you are an Optery for Business administrator at [https://business.optery.com/](https://business.optery.com/), or by contacting our support team at [support@optery.com](mailto:support@optery.com?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB).

**b. For Custom Scans**

We issue refunds at our discretion on a case-by-case basis. Optery employs state-of-the-art technology to scan for your personal information across hundreds of data broker sites. The results of a custom scan, however, can significantly vary based on the provided Profile Name, City, and State. Custom Scans can save hours of time versus searching through hundreds of data broker sites manually, but are not represented or warranted to be 100% accurate. The accuracy of Custom Scans may vary depending on a number of factors. If this is not what you expected, we do not recommend purchasing a Custom Scan. Problems with your scan?¬†¬†[Email Customer Support](mailto:support@optery.com). More details on the refund process can be found at our Help Desk.
