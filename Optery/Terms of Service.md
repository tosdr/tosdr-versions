#### **5.** **Subscriptions**

Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“**Subscription(s)**”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“**Billing Cycle**”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly, quartrely, or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Optery, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal from the Plans & Billing section of your Account page ([https://app.optery.com/account](https://app.optery.com/account?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB)), from your dashboard for Optery for Business administrators ([https://business.optery.com/](https://business.optery.com/?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB)), or by contacting [support@optery.com](mailto:support@optery.com?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB).

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Optery, Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Optery, Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Optery, Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

#### **6.** **Removal Services**

Our subscription plans provide services for submitting personal information opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression and removal requests to lists of third-party data brokers and information aggregators (“**Removal List(s)**”) on your behalf (“**Removal Service(s)**”).

At any time and without notice, Optery, Inc. reserves the right to modify the Removal Lists and Removal Services covered by each subscription plan, this includes adding and removing data brokers and information aggregators from the Removal Lists and adding and removing features and functionality for the Removal Services.  You acknowledge and agree that Optery, Inc.’s Removal Lists and Removal Services are subject to change on an ongoing basis and that Optery, Inc. is not required to send notifications for each change. Major changes to the Removal Services will be communicated to Optery’s registered users and Optery will provide such communication by sending an email notification to the primary email address of each affected Account.

You acknowledge and agree that (i) Optery, Inc. will use good faith, reasonable efforts to provide the Removal Services, but that there is no guarantee or warranty of any kind that third-parties will honor or comply with the opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression or removal requests, (ii) it is not possible for Optery, Inc. to remove 100% of your personal information from the Internet, or even from all of the data brokers and information aggregators in each Removal List, (iii) Removal Services will be provided for data broker profiles primarily representing you and will not be provided for data broker profiles primarily representing someone other than you, and (iv) it can sometimes take multiple months from your initial subscription plan purchase for third-parties to remove your personal information from their web site(s).

As a condition to fulfilling your subscription plan, (i) you must provide your personally identifiable information (“**PII**”) such as full name, birth year and current city and state of residence to Optery, Inc. and (ii) Optery, Inc. must send this information to the data brokers and information aggregators included in the Removal Lists, and occasionally to government agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (“**FTC**“) or State Attorney General offices to file complaints against data brokers and information aggregators not complying with opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression and removal requests.  This information is required by the data brokers and information aggregators in order to locate your record(s) and remove you from their database(s), and by the government agencies to receive complaints against data brokers and information aggregators not complying with opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression and removal requests.  We cannot control, guarantee or warranty how these third-parties will treat your PII or what they will do with it.  By purchasing and maintaining an active Subscription, you approve Optery, Inc. to submit your PII to data brokers and information aggregators for the purposes of submitting opt out, data deletion, do not sell, do not share, suppression and removal requests.  If you do not wish Optery, Inc. to submit your PII to data brokers and information aggregators for the purposes submitting opt out, suppression and removal requests, then you should not use Optery’s Removal Services.

You acknowledge and agree each Removal Services account Subscription plan may only be used for a single individual person. Name variations and aliases supported by each Removal Services account Subscription are for a single individual person who has utilized different names during their life, but are not permitted to be used to provide Removal Services to multiple different people or for individuals other than the individual account owner of the Removal Services Subscription.

Optery, Inc. supports unlimited name variations and name aliases for the same individual person for the Free Basic, Extended, and Ultimate Subscription plans, but NOT for the Core plan. The Core plan only covers one single name.

#### **7.** **Authorized Agent**

By purchasing and maintaining an active Subscription, you agree to designate and appoint Optery, Inc. to represent you as your Authorized Agent to act on your behalf submitting and managing your data preferences requests and exercising your data rights under any U.S. or State data privacy laws for the sole purpose of delivering the Optery Service as defined in the Optery Terms of Service, including:

(i) submitting opt out, suppression, removal, and do not sell requests to companies and organizations for my data

(ii) submitting data deletion requests to companies and organizations for my data

(iii) submitting data subject access requests to companies and organizations for my data and requesting a copy of my data from companies and organizations

(iv) communicating on my behalf with companies and organizations regarding the status of my data rights and preferences requests

(v) signing documents regarding my data rights and preferences requests

This designation and appointment of Optery, Inc. as your Authorized Agent will begin on the date of your Subscription activation and will continue in full effect until one or more of the following:

(i) your Subscription plan is canceled by you or by Optery, Inc.

You understand that by this agreement Optery, Inc. is not your attorney. You understand that you have the right to seek advice from an attorney at any time that you choose. 

You understand the limits of Optery’s liability for actions taken as your Authorized Agent shall not exceed those stated in the Optery Terms of Service.

You agree to revoke any previous agreements designating or appointing other parties as your Authorized Agent for the purpose of executing your data preferences and rights.

Optery, Inc.’s designation and appointment as your Authorized Agent will continue in full force until your subscription plan is cancelled by you or by Optery, Inc.  You may cancel your subscription plan at any time from the Plans & Billing section of your Account page.

Optery, Inc. also offers a Limited Power of Attorney document that can be electronically signed for the purpose of appointing Optery as your Authorized Agent for submitting your data rights requests. When that document is signed, its terms supersede the Authorized Agent terms included in these Terms of Service.

#### **8.** **Free Trial**

Optery, Inc. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“**Free Trial**”).  However, at this time, Optery, Inc. does not offer a Free Trial.

If Optery, Inc. does begin offering a Free Trial in the future, you may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by Optery, Inc. until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, Optery, Inc. reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

#### **9.** **Fee Changes**

Optery, Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Optery, Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate or change your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

#### **10. Refunds**

**a. For Subscriptions**

We issue refunds for contracts within thirty (30) days of the original contract purchase. To qualify for a refund, you must cancel your subscription renewal within this thirty-day period. Please note, as there is only one original purchase per contract, we cannot honor multiple refund requests for the same account or individual. Upon issuing a refund, your plan will immediately revert to the Free Basic tier, and any remaining unused subscription time will be forfeited. You can cancel your plan through the “Plans & Billing” section on your Account page at [https://app.optery.com/account](https://app.optery.com/account), through your dashboard if you are an Optery for Business administrator at [https://business.optery.com/](https://business.optery.com/), or by contacting our support team at [support@optery.com](mailto:support@optery.com?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB). For more information about the refund process, please visit our [Help Desk](https://help.optery.com/en/?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart_LG_2021.10.05&utm_term=remove&utm_content=deleted&utm_campaign=smart_LG_2021.10.05&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1ZGcBhCoARIsAGQ0kkomTufOL15XcQHT8KigwiPusRklCgGgOFiTUakwxHfKg2Y5AKcZkSoaAo4CEALw_wcB).

**b. For Custom Scans**

We issue refunds at our discretion on a case-by-case basis. Optery employs state-of-the-art technology to scan for your personal information across hundreds of data broker sites. The results of a custom scan, however, can significantly vary based on the provided Profile Name, City, and State. Custom Scans can save hours of time versus searching through hundreds of data broker sites manually, but are not represented or warranted to be 100% accurate. The accuracy of Custom Scans may vary depending on a number of factors. If this is not what you expected, we do not recommend purchasing a Custom Scan. Problems with your scan?  [Email Customer Support](mailto:support@optery.com). More details on the refund process can be found at our Help Desk.
