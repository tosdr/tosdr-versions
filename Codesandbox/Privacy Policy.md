Certain features of our service require you to register beforehand to gain access to a secured platform/portal environment, including a management environment where you can set, specify and change settings.

* Company name (if relevant)
* IP address
* Any information you enter yourself while using the service

We store this information until you close your account.

* Name
* Address
* Username
* Email address
* Payment details

We store this data until you close your account. We keep some data longer if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., because of the 7-year tax retention obligation).

### Sending newsletters

We have a monthly newsletter to inform those interested in news, tips and information about our products and services. Furthermore, we can send personalised messages based on your account should you wish to do so.

We process the following personal data for this purpose:

* Name
* Username

Your personal data is stored until you unsubscribe from our newsletter. If you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, you can unsubscribe at any time. There is an unsubscribe link in every newsletter.

When you send us an email or contact us in any other way you agree to our offer to enter into correspondence (performance of the contract).

We process the following personal data for this purpose:

* Name
* Email address
* Any information you provide in your message

We store your data for as long as the correspondence requires it or up to 5 years after you sent your query to ensure that we have reasonably complete conversation histories with users.

### Support

We may offer support for our services through email, contact forms, telephone or in other ways, in which case you agree to our offer to enter into correspondence (performance of the contract). In this context, we may also use this data – where possible in anonymized form – to improve and train our services (legitimate interest).

For this purpose, we process the following personal data:

* Name
* Login data
* Apple ID
* Google Play account

For this purpose, we process the following personal data:

* Name
* Timezone
* Contact details (email address)

If we are unable to offer you a position at this time, we may – with your consent – keep the application data for one more year. You can revoke your consent at any time by sending us an email to [\[email protected\]](https://codesandbox.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will store your application data in your personnel file should you decide to work for us. This file will be stored for as long as necessary, and the application data will be kept for a maximum of 2 years after entering into employment.

A social media and internet screening can be part of the application procedure. This is necessary for us to preserve our image when hiring new staff; we do this on a legitimate interest basis. We will do a search of your name on Google and any profile you may have on various social media. This applies, of course, insofar as these profiles are public. We will not ask you to grant us access to a private social media page or to accept a request from us. The results of the screening will be discussed with you. Should you have any objections to this, you can inform us by e-mail at the time of your application.

### ReCAPTCHA

We use the reCAPTCHA service of Google LLC. (hereinafter: “Google”) to protect our website against spam and abuse. In order for Google reCAPTCHA to work, the IP address of a website visitor, mouse movements and possibly other data are collected. This information is sent to and processed by Google for this purpose. By analysing this information, Google can determine whether we are dealing with a real website visitor or a robot. For more information, please see [Google's privacy statement](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

### Usage of OpenAI API Service

Our AI tools, among which the AI assistant we offer as part of our services, utilize the OpenAI API Service to fulfil chat requests and operate the core functionality of the AI assistant. If permissions are explicitly granted by team admins on the CodeSandbox platform, CodeSandbox transmits the chat input, which may include personal information, to Open AI for processing.

OpenAI takes appropriate security measures to protect your data and uses your data in accordance with its data usage policy. For more information on how OpenAI processes and protects your data, please visit their [Privacy Policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/data-usage-policies) and [Terms of Service](https://platform.openai.com/docs/terms-of-service).
