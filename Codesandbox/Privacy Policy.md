* Name
* Address
* Username

* Payment details

We store this data until you close your account. We keep some data longer if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., because of the 7-year tax retention obligation).

We process the following personal data for this purpose:

When you send us an email or contact us in any other way you agree to our offer to enter into correspondence (performance of the contract).

We process the following personal data for this purpose:

* Name
* Email address
* Any information you provide in your message

We store your data for as long as the correspondence requires it or up to 5 years after you sent your query to ensure that we have reasonably complete conversation histories with users.

### Support

We may offer support for our services through email, contact forms, telephone or in other ways, in which case you agree to our offer to enter into correspondence (performance of the contract).

For this purpose, we process the following personal data:

You can revoke your consent at any time by sending us an email to [\[email protected\]](https://codesandbox.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will store your application data in your personnel file should you decide to work for us. This file will be stored for as long as necessary, and the application data will be kept for a maximum of 2 years after entering into employment.

A social media and internet screening can be part of the application procedure. This is necessary for us to preserve our image when hiring new staff; we do this on a legitimate interest basis. We will do a search of your name on Google and any profile you may have on various social media. This applies, of course, insofar as these profiles are public. We will not ask you to grant us access to a private social media page or to accept a request from us. The results of the screening will be discussed with you. Should you have any objections to this, you can inform us by e-mail at the time of your application.

This information is sent to and processed by Google for this purpose. By analysing this information, Google can determine whether we are dealing with a real website visitor or a robot.
