**Thank you for visiting the IN.gov Web Portal (hereinafter referred to as “IN.gov”) and reviewing our privacy notice.** This notice describes how we handle information that is collected from you when you use our website.

IN.gov consists of all webpages and web applications bearing an “IN.gov” top-level domain that represent agencies under the Executive Branch of Indiana State Government. For the sake of clarity, this includes State agencies reporting to the Governor, Auditor of State, Treasurer of State, Secretary of State, and Attorney General.

This privacy notice applies only to IN.gov and does not apply to other collection of information by the State of Indiana outside of IN.gov. You may wish to review the privacy notice on any other state agencies’ websites you visit as well.

* [Information collected](#)
    
    In accordance with the Indiana Fair Information Practice Act, IN.gov only collects the minimum amount of information necessary to serve our customers.
    
    **Analytics**
    
    IN.gov uses Google Analytics and other third-party analytics applications, including Zendesk and Funnelback, to automatically collect the following analytics when you browse our site:
    
    * Your Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain name.
    * The type of browser, device, and operating system used to access the IN.gov web portal.
    * The date and time you access the IN.gov web portal and the length of your visit.
    * The pages you visit, including the files you download, and links you click on.
    * The activities you engage in and services you access including forms, searches, videos, and chatbots.
    * The address of the referring website, if you were referred to IN.gov from another web site.
    * Aggregated data related to your demographics and interests.
    
    IN.gov does not associate this data to individual user identities.
    
    **User-volunteered information**
    
    In addition to the IP address/browser information collected from visitors to the site, personal information is collected and stored only when users provide it voluntarily. For example, if you send us an email, sign up for a subscription or service, complete a transaction, or complete and submit a form, some personal information is collected and stored.
    
    All these activities are purely voluntary. You will always have the option of whether to provide this information using IN.gov. State agencies must provide paper-based alternatives when requested.
    
    **Cookies**
    
    When you visit our website, we may collect information from you automatically through cookies or similar technology in order to improve your experience on our website.
    
    Cookies are small, often encrypted text files captured by your device’s browser upon loading a particular website. Every time you go back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website’s server.
    
    Sensitive personal information is not stored within cookies. You can adjust the settings in your browser to disable cookies.
    
* [Use of collected information](#)
    
    * All uses of information, whether the information is collected automatically or provided voluntarily, are in accordance with the Indiana Fair Information Practices Act. 
    * IN.gov uses the information automatically collected from your browser to enable the efficient operation of the website, to enhance the ease of use of the website, and to gather statistics on how you use the website. 
    * IN.gov uses any information you voluntarily provide to provide services requested, to respond to inquiries, and improve our services. 
    * IN.gov itself does not use collected information for marketing purposes; however, state agencies using the IN.gov portal for their websites may use information collected on those sites to send direct communications to users who provide contact information.
    
* [Distribution of collected information](#)
    
    * IN.gov will only send personal information about you to other government agencies, individuals, or organizations when:
        * We have your consent to share the information;
        * Your inquiry relates to another state agency and we need to share information with that agency to fulfill your request;
        * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested. For example, without limitation, IN.gov uses a third-party billing organization, and it sends information for billing purposes only;
        * We need to send the information to organizations who work on behalf of IN.gov to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these organizations do not have any right to use the personal information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us);
        * We are authorized to do so by law, subpoena, court order, or legal process; or
        * We find that your actions on State websites violate the IN.gov Terms of Use Agreement or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.
    * IN.gov will not distribute or sell personal information to third-party organizations unless records are authorized for sale under law.
    
* [Retention of Collected Information](#)
    
    * The State of Indiana government is required to maintain many government records under the Indiana Archives and Records Act for archival and historical purposes.
    * When you provide personal information to State agencies through IN.gov, such information is handled as it would be in an in-person transaction in a government office, and is subject to the laws, regulations, practices, and procedures of the respective agency.
    * Some governmental agencies may already have, or may acquire, personal information through the normal functions of government. Indiana law governs the use of and access to this information under the Indiana Fair Information Practices Act and the Indiana Access to Public Records Act. If State or Federal law treats information as a disclosable public record, a State agency may choose to make the record available through IN.gov in much the same manner as the agency would make a record available to a member of the public who visits the agency in-person.
    
* [User choices](#)
    
    * You can request access to your personal information or request that we delete your account by [contacting us at INWP](https://www.in.gov/inwp/contact-us/). Please understand that, although we can delete your account online, the Indiana Archives and Records Act may require us to maintain information about your account for a period of years.
    * As previously noted in the Cookies section of this Notice, you can adjust the settings in your browser to disable cookies.
    * As noted in the Analytics section of this notice, IN.gov uses Google Analytics to collect browser data to improve our products, services, and sites. While Google Analytics data does not contain directly-identifiable information, you may opt out of all Google Analytics data collection by [clicking here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9019185) and following Google’s instructions.
    
* [Security](#)
    
    * IN.gov is committed to ensuring the integrity of the information and systems it maintains. As such, IN.gov has instituted security measures for all information systems under its control in a best effort to ensure that information will not be lost, misused, or altered.
    * For site security purposes, and to ensure that our Internet services remain available to all users, IN.gov uses software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise harm the integrity of IN.gov. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to aid in the identification of an individual.
    
* [Privacy Notice Revisions](#)
    
    This Privacy Notice was last revised on 11/9/2023. We may change this Privacy Notice at any time and for any reason. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice each time you visit the web site.
    
    This is a statement of policy and should not be interpreted as a contract of any kind.
    
* [Responsibility for External Sites](#)
    
    This website may contain links to other web sites. Some of those web sites may be operated by third parties. We provide the links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of web sites operated by others.
    
    Once you travel to another site, you are subject to the privacy notice of the new site. Therefore, whenever you leave this web site, we recommend that you review each web site's privacy practices and make your own conclusions regarding the adequacy of these practices.
    
* [Children](#)
    
    * IN.gov is committed to the protection of children’s online privacy and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13.
    * IN.gov is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    * IN.gov does not sell products or services for purchase by children. IN.gov specifically asks children to get a parent’s or guardian’s permission before providing any information online.
    * In the event children unknowingly provide information through IN.gov, it is only used to enable us to respond to the writer.
    
* [Contact](#)
