There is no functionality to determine which entry will win ahead of time. When you click the wheel, it accelerates for exactly one second, then it is set to a random rotation between 0 and 360 degrees, and finally it decelerates to a stop. The setting of a random rotation is not visible to the naked eye as it happens when the wheel is spinning quite fast.
