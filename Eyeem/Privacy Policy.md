When you have registered as a creator, you can upload content to EyeEm via our website or app.

When you would like to upload content to EyeEm via the app, you must first give EyeEm access to your media library (i.e. Camera Roll or Photo Albums) on your mobile device. With this permission, we will display the folders and photos available in your media library from which you can select photos and upload them to your profile (Community or Market). In addition, the “Suggestions” tab within the upload process will show you the photos that you have either already liked in your media library (“Favorites”) or edited in other photo related apps (e.g. VSCO, Snapseed, Lightroom, Instagram, Flickr, etc.) and that also have a minimum size of 4 million pixels.

Beyond the purpose of a preselection of your photos, we do not process or store your photos or any other data that may be contained in your photos or media library before you select a photo and start to upload it. You can revoke your consent to access your media library at any time in the privacy settings of your mobile device. Without this consent you cannot upload pictures to the app, but you can still use other functions of the app (e.g. discover pictures of selected photographers, read articles in the EyeEm magazine).

When you upload content, we also process the information contained in the metadata of such content (so- called exif data), such as the date, time and location of the shot, camera type, shutter speed, etc., as well as any additional information you provide about the content (e.g. tags, captions).

We use this data to provide our services, in particular to optimize the quality and sales opportunities of your content.

* Your name
* Your address
* Your email address
* Where applicable, your date of birth (model release), and
* Where applicable, the location or description of your property (property release).

We only disclose the information to our distribution partners (by sending them the entire release document) and, if necessary, to the specific licensee. For more information, please see section 5.2.

Storage time: We store the releases as long as your content is available at EyeEm Market, in the case of a license sale of such content, we also store the respective release(s) beyond this period for the duration of possible legal claims in order to be able to prove our authorization to license the content commercially.

The same applies to third parties to whom the content may be transferred.

Legal basis: 

If the content with your image was uploaded by a **community account**, the legal basis for this processing of your personal data is our legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). Our legitimate interests are the development of new products and services based on artificial intelligence, the improvement of our current products and services, and the monetization of our content. You have the right to exercise your right to object to this processing of your data, which you can exercise in accordance with the provisions set forth below.

If the content with your image was uploaded by a **market account**, the legal basis for this processing of your personal data is the fulfilment of a contract between you and the creator (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).

### **(c) Cookies and similar technologies**

For our service to work properly, we sometimes store small files – called cookies – on your device. This is common on most major websites.

#### **(i) What are cookies?**

A cookie is a small text file that a web portal leaves on your device (computer, tablet or smartphone) when you visit it. This allows the portal to “remember” certain inputs and settings (e.g., login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over a period of time, and you do not need to re-enter them each time you visit and navigate the portal.

#### **(ii) How can you exercise control over cookies?**

You can control and/or delete cookies at your convenience. You can find out how to do this in the help function of the browser you are using or, for example, here: aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies stored on your device and set most browsers to prevent the storage of cookies, but then you may be required to make some settings manually each time you visit a page and accept the impairment of some features.

#### **(iii) EyeEm cookies**

On our website we use the following cookies:

* **Strictly necessary cookies:** These cookies are necessary for our websites and services to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will then not work. These cookies store your session ID so that our servers can recognize you, but do not store any further personally identifiable information. 

Legal basis: The legal basis for the processing of your personal data by means of necessary cookies is our legitimate interest in a needs-based design of our websites and app (Art.6 (1) (f) GDPR).

With your explicit consent (in the cookies banner displayed on our websites and app) we use the following cookies:

* **Performance cookies:** These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure, analyze and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
* **Targeting cookies:** These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
* **Functional cookies:** These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation of our website and services, such as the language you selected. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

The cookies are not used for any purposes other than those mentioned above. **After having given your consent** you can opt-out of each cookie category (except strictly necessary cookies) in the “cookie settings” of your account. The cookie customization settings are provided by the service provider OneTrust.

#### **(iv) Third-party cookies and similar third-party technologies**

In addition to our own cookies, we also use third-party cookies and similar technologies (such as counting pixels) to provide our services, including troubleshooting, quality assurance, system-security monitoring, statistics and analytics, and a user-friendly design of our offerings (e.g. location-based photo contests), to measure efficiency and for optimization of advertisements we provide with other providers. As the providers and other technologies used may change, you should periodically review our Privacy Policy for updates.

Legal basis: The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in this context is your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR in connection with Sec. 25 (1) German Telecommunications Telemedia Data Protection Act).

**_Provision of our services_**

**\- Google Analytics**

On our website we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland ("Google").  Google Analytics uses cookies which are text files placed on your computer to help analyze how users use our websites. The information generated by the cookies is regularly transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. However, since IP anonymization is enabled on our website, Google will abbreviate the IP address of users within the EU Member States or within other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to Google. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be sent to a Google server in the US and abbreviated there. Google is certified under the EU-US data protection framework and thus offers a guarantee that the European level of data protection is maintained.

Google processes this information on our behalf to analyze the use of the website by the user, to provide reports on the activities on the website and to provide other services in connection with the use of the website for EyeEm. As part of the services provided by Google Analytics, the IP address transmitted by the user’s browser will not be merged with other data collected by Google.

You may prevent the collection of cookie-generated data about your use of the website (including IP address) and its processing by Google by downloading and installing the following browser plug-in via the link below: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

**\- Amplitude**

Within our app, we use the analysis services of Amplitude Inc., San Francisco, 201 3rd Street, Suite 200, United States, (“Amplitude”) to collect certain data about the use of the app. The data collected includes your country of origin (including city and region) from which you registered and use the app, the language you use on your device, information about your device (model, operating system and version, mobile operator, device ID) and information about your usage (total duration in hours; date and time of last access to the app) and use of the various functions in the app (upload, discover, missions, etc.). The data obtained in this way is regularly transmitted to a server of Amplitude in the US. The data is stored and analyzed there and then transmitted to EyeEm. This service enables us to better understand the behavior of our app users and make the EyeEm Community and EyeEm Market more user- friendly and attractive. Amplitude is certified under the EU-US data protection framework and thus offers a guarantee that the European level of data protection is maintained. To find out more about how Amplitude uses information for analytical purposes can be found in the Amplitude Privacy Policy: https://amplitude.com/privacy.

**\- Crashlytics Firebase**

We have integrated the analysis service Crashlytics, a service of Google  Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland ("Crashlytics") into our app. Crashlytics collects information for us on how and under what circumstances the app crashes. The service therefore searches for crashes of the app, analyzes the collected data and provides us with reports.

This enables us to build and maintain our service by means of user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users' behavior and their devices (in particular the IP address of the device (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our website). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see Hotjar’s Privacy Policy at [https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy/](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy/).

**_Advertising_**

We use so-called AdServers and their tracking tools to measure, optimize, and track clicks on our ads which we position on other sites. This process is used to evaluate the effectiveness of ads for statistical and market research purposes and may help optimize future advertising efforts. If you submit personal data via an ad-form (e.g. your name and email address), such information will be transferred to EyeEm and stored in Hubspot, a service used for client management. If you are already registered with EyeEm (Buyer Account), your user ID will be linked to the data collected in an ad-form.

In all other cases, we only receive statistical pseudonymous data without reference to a specific person. Such data is stored in a cookie. In connection with the display of ads, third-party servers are necessarily contacted directly when using EyeEm. The third-party providers themselves are responsible for the privacy- compliant operation of the IT systems they use and the storage duration.

Here you will find more information about the tracking pixels we use and their data processing:

**\- Meta Pixel**

We use the "conversion pixel" of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irland (“Meta”).
