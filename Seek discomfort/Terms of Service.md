Arbitration Agreement
=====================

In an effort to reduce the time and expense associated with legal disputes, the Company and you agree that any dispute, controversy or claim arising under or relating in any way to your use of this Site or to any goods purchased by you from the Company, any alleged breach of the Company’s Terms of Use or otherwise relating to this Site (each, a “Dispute”), will be resolved by binding arbitration, provided that the party first asserting a Dispute will make a good faith effort to attempt to resolve the Dispute with the other party as provided below and that either party may assert individual claims in small claims court if such claims qualify. 

The party first asserting a Dispute shall provide written notice of the Dispute to the other party, describing the facts and circumstances of the matter and allowing the other party 30 days in which to respond or settle the Dispute, before it may commence an arbitration or small claims court proceeding.  Notice of a Dispute shall be sent:

* if to the Company: Seek Discomfort, LLC, 1113 Electric Ave, Unit 6 Venice, CA 90291

* if to you, at your last-used billing address or the billing or shipping address in your online profile.

**There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.   However, remedies that would otherwise be available to you in court under applicable federal, state or local laws shall remain available to you in arbitration.  You have the right to be represented by an attorney in the arbitration.**

If a Dispute is not resolved within the 30-day period described above, the party asserting a Dispute may commence an arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).  A copy of the arbitration demand must also be sent at the same time to the Company, at the address provided above.  The arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”), as modified by this Agreement.  A copy of the Rules may be found at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879.  In the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to conduct the arbitration, the parties shall in good faith attempt to select another arbitration provider.  The arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California or, if you prefer, it may be conducted by telephone or in the county where you live.  Each party will be entitled to conduct discovery of any relevant non-privileged information.  The arbitrator shall issue an award that consists of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim.  The award shall also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

The Company will reimburse you for any filing, administrative or arbitrator fees paid by you where your claims are for less than $10,000 total, provided the arbitrator does not find that your claims were frivolous.  The Company waives its right to seek the recovery of its attorneys’ fees and costs from you, unless the arbitrator finds that your claims were frivolous.

**Each of us agrees that any dispute resolution proceeding will only be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  Each of us waives any right to a jury trial, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or arbitration or to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or arbitration, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.**  If a court determines that applicable law prohibits the enforcement of any particular provision of this paragraph as to a particular cause of action, that cause of action only may remain in court and will be severed from any arbitration.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall restrict the Company from commencing a legal or equitable action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Arbitration Agreement shall continue in force after your use of this Site ends.

General
=======

Except for the Arbitration Agreement, which shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its choice of laws principles.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that provision shall be severable to the extent it is invalid or unenforceable, and the remainder of these Terms (including any portion of such provision that is not found to be invalid or unenforceable) shall remain in full force and effect.  The waiver of any provision of these Terms shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other provision or of such provision in the future.  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of the Site.
