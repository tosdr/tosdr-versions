15. UPGRADE POLICY
    
    1. The Company shall provide improved versions of the software free of charge, especially when a new version mainly consists of minor improvements and fixes. However, from time to time there will be new versions that require rewrites of the Software or parts of the Software. This process requires significant research, design, development and testing time. In those situations and on a case-by-case basis, the Company reserves the right to require a fee for upgrading to the new and improved version of the Software. Given the resources it would take, we would hate to withhold implementing these improvements purely based on financial decisions; charging a nominal fee for updates is the only way to accomplish this. If you do not feel new functionality is worth the upgrade you can always stay with your current version.
    2. We highly recommend subscribing to our newsletter to be informed about both minor and major updates to your Software. Also, this is usually the best way to get a good deal on both new Software and new functionality releases.

If the licensee is not satisfied with the correction, then Licensee may terminate this agreement, but without refund of any amount paid to licensee or release of any amounts due to licensor at the time of termination.
    3. In the case that licensee has technical questions in the use of the software during the tenure of this agreement, the licensee may submit those questions to licensor on e-mail or raise a support ticket, and the Licensor shall provide consulting to answer such questions without charge to licensee till the license is valid.
