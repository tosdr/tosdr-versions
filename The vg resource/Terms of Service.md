Comments  
  
While we attempt to edit or remove any messages containing inappropriate, sexually orientated, abusive, hateful, slanderous, or threatening material that could be considered invasive of a persons privacy, or which otherwise violate any kind of law, it is impossible for us to review every message posted through our discussion systems. For this reason you acknowledge that all messages posted on our discussion system express the views and opinions of the original message author and not necessarily the views of our website. Therefore we take no responsibility and cannot be held liable for any messages posted. We do not vouch for or warrant the accuracy and completeness of every message.  
  
Posting  
  
By registering you agree that you will not post any material which is knowingly false, inaccurate, abusive, hateful, harassing, sexually orientated, threatening or invasive of a person's privacy, or any other material which may violate any applicable laws.  
  
Any material posted on this website which is not your own content (meaning, in this case, someone else's custom work or rip) will be perceived as theft, and will result in harsh repercussions. You cannot submit someone else's custom work, edited work, or rip under any circumstances, regardless of whether or not you were given permission or are crediting them as the submitter.  
  
Taking content in its original format from this website and distributing it elsewhere without prior consent or credit to its origin will also result in contact being made with those seen fit to have it removed as this is also viewed as theft.  
  
Use of the content of this site is not included in this term, as that is the purpose of this resource. Feel free to use the content as you wish (where legally permitted or in unpublished, non-commercial works).  
  
Use of Content  
  
Content on these sites may not be used in any commercial works. These include, but are not limited to, paid games, free games with in-app purchases or advertisements, monetized videos, and other websites displaying advertisements. This also includes anything 100% free being published to an established market place (e.g. Steam, Apple's App Store, or Google Play). Custom work may be used in non-commercial projects as long as the artist is credited, provided there is nothing included with the submission that would prohibit its use, and in commercial works with the artist's permission and proper credit, provided that the subject matter of the custom work is not copyrighted to another entity (e.g. a custom Mario sprite may still have copyright requirements enforced by Nintendo). Some custom submissions may display "no credit required" or similar but many were created long before the potential for videos seen by millions was known so we ask that you credit them regardless.  
  
Repercussions  
  
Failure to comply with these rules may result in the termination of your account, account suspension, or permanent ban of access to the site. Your IP Address is recorded with each post you make on this website and is retrievable by the forum staff if need-be. You agree that we have the ability and right to remove, edit, or lock any account or message at any time should it be seen fit.  
  
Your Information and Cookies  
  
You agree that any information you enter upon registration or discussion is stored in a database, and that cookies are stored on your computer to save your login information. We will never store cookies besides those that enhance your experience on this website without your prior consent.  
  
Disclosure  
  
Any information you provide on this site will not be disclosed to any third party without your complete consent, although the staff cannot be held liable for any hacking attempt in which your data is compromised. That being said, we make every effort to secure your data using industry-standard best practices but we will notify you as soon as any compromise is detected, should one occur.
