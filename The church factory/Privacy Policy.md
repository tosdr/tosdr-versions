We run an analytics script from Plausible.io to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal data is collected. For transparency, we make [all the analytics data we can see](https://plausible.io/thechurchfactory.com?ref=thechurchfactory.com) public. 📊

Data collected includes websites that send us traffic (like DuckDuck Go or Google), pages on our site that are visited (such as this page), duration of the visits (how long you've read this), information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit and more. 🕸

Additionally, we use CloudFlare to help manage and mitigate security threats. All traffic going between our site and you may go through their servers. Read their [Privacy Policy here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/?ref=thechurchfactory.com).

We use a company called Ghost to host our website. You can find their [Privacy Policy here](https://ghost.org/privacy/?ref=thechurchfactory.com).
