=============

Last Updated: July 2024  
  
Your privacy is important to us. Formilytics LLC, D.B.A. BDOW! (formerly Sumo) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Formilytics,” “we,” or “us”), understand your concerns with regard to how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will use and share information about you carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how we use it, with whom we may share it, and what choices you have regarding it. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of our web or mobile site, or other application (the “Site”) and any other means by which we may collect information about you, including information you may provide to us other than on the Site. We encourage you to become familiar with this Privacy Policy. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices (and any uses and disclosures of information about you) that are described in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of other companies or other websites. We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of each website that you visit.  
  
**1\. What information do we collect, and how do we collect it?** We and our third-party service providers (“Contractors”) may collect certain information from or about you in connection with your use of, or your submissions to or via, the Site (together, “Collected Information”), including, but not limited to, email address. In addition, we and our Contractors may retain the content of, and metadata regarding, any correspondence you may have with us or our representatives, regardless of the mode of communication by which such correspondence was made. This information helps us to improve the Site and the online content, materials, and services that we make available on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond to both current and future inquiries. As part of your participation on the Site, you may post user generated content in certain areas of the Site. You acknowledge that posting user generated content on the Site is at your own risk. While the Site may provide features that permit you to limit access to your pages on the Site, you acknowledge that these security measures are limited and could be circumvented. Formilytics has no control over the actions of other users of the Site with whom you choose to share your pages and your Collected Information. Accordingly, user generated content posted by you might be accessible to unauthorized persons. Formilytics is not responsible for any actions by third parties to circumvent the privacy and security mechanisms contained in the Website. You further acknowledge that, even after user generated content might be removed from the Site, copies of such user generated content could still be viewable through the Site if other users of the Site have copied and stored your user generated content or if individuals have access to archived or cached versions of the pages before the user generated content was removed. As with many other websites, the web servers used to operate the Site may  
  
collect certain data pertaining to you, including data regarding the equipment and communications method that you use to access the Site, and your activities on our Site. For security reasons and to confirm the integrity of the Site, we and our Contractors may combine components of this data with Collected Information, which may identify you. Unless otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, such identifying information (which is deemed “Collected Information” hereunder) will be used solely for our business purposes. In addition, the Collected Information may reveal such things as the Internet protocol (“IP”) address assigned to your computer, specific pages that you access on the Site or prior to or after visiting the Site, and the length of time you spend at the Site. We and our Contractors may use this information to help administer the Site and the servers that provide the Site, generate statistical information, monitor and analyze Site traffic and usage patterns, and improve the Site’s content and content delivery, including any online content, materials, and services that we describe or make available on the Site. In addition, our Site may send one or more “cookies” to your computer to improve the utility of the Site by storing user preferences and tracking user trends (also deemed “Collected Information” hereunder). Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Site if cookies are disabled on your browser. We may collect your information through our use of Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. The Google Analytics tool uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Site and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Company. For more information regarding Google Analytics please visit Google’s website, and pages that describe Google Analytics, such as http://google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. We may We use “pixel tags,” also known as “web beacons,” which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.  
  
**2\. How will we use the information you provide to us?** In addition to the uses described above, we and our Contractors may use Collected Information to analyze and improve the content, materials, and services that we make available on the Site, to notify you of changes made to the Site, to evaluate user needs and improve the Site content, to send you promotional materials, and support our continuing efforts to offer users the information and services we think they want most. If you contact us for support or assistance, we may use Collected Information to provide service and support to you. We may also use Collected Information and the associated statistical data we and our Contractors generate to deliver targeted advertisements to you and other visitors of our Site. We may also contact you to confirm registration information and regarding changes to Formilytics’ Terms of Use and this Privacy Statement. On occasion, we may send you updates, a newsletter or other news regarding the Site. You may choose to “opt-out” of these notifications at any time, even after you have provided personally identifiable information, by following the procedures set forth below. Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, if you initially do not choose to “opt-in,” or if you later “opt-out,” you may not be eligible for certain services from us for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information is needed. An opt-out preference will be processed for the consumer account. As part of your registration on the Site, you shall receive a user profile. Your profile information, as well as your name and email may be displayed to other people on the Site in accordance with your privacy settings. Formilytics may send you, and third parties identified by you, service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the Site, such as to indicate that you have received a message from another user or to alert you of an event for which you have asked to receive alerts. Formilytics may use information you submit to the Site in a non-identifying fashion (unless otherwise permitted by you) in order to provide aggregate statistics regarding user membership and service hours completed from the Site and to provide personalized service opportunities to you. We and our Contractors may store Collected Information for as long as needed for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, which may be indefinitely. Except for the above, we will not share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of the Company unless we have your affirmative (and informed) consent to do so. We do not collect or share any sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information is a particular category of personal information relating to racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality.  

1\. 1. Subscription, Free Trials, Billing and Cancellation.  
  
(a) Subscription.  
  

* (i) **Ongoing Subscription.** Your subscription, which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to-month or year-to-year unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, “Payment Method”) to use the subscription services. We will bill the monthly or annual subscription fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month’s subscription fees to your Payment Method.
* (ii) **Differing Subscriptions.** We may offer a number of subscription plans, including special promotional plans with differing conditions and limitations. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your subscription by accessing the store within your install and clicking on the Billing tab. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans.

  
(b) Free Trials.  
  

* (i) Your subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for 14 days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. We reserve the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.
* (ii) We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your subscription, including monthly subscription price and end date of your free trial period, access the store within your install and click on the Billing tab. We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month or year of service as soon as you register.
* (iii) You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun. CLICK THE “BILLING” TAB WITHIN STORE ON YOUR INSTALL TO CANCEL ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS. If you are unable to find them, contact us immediately at https://help.sumome.com/. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly or yearly basis for your subscription fee until you cancel.

(c) Billing.  
  

* (i) Recurring Billing. By starting your subscription and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly or yearly subscription fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the subscription service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary from month to month or year to year for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including VIP Code redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly or yearly in one or more charges.
* (ii) Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Sale, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.
* (iii) Billing Cycle. The subscription fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your subscription or began paying on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription. Access the store within your install and click on the Billing tab to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Sale, “billing” shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month, monthly, yearly, and annually refers to your billing cycle.
* (iv) 7-day Money Back Guarantee. Refunds will be provided up to 7 days after the original purchase if the services do not meet your expectations. Clients who purchase via Shopify will be subject to Shopify’s refund policies and will be reimbursed with Shopify store credits. More information can be found on Shopify’s Terms of Sale page. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.
* (v) Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by accessing the store within your install and clicking on the Payments tab. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, “Cancellation” below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
* (vi) Cancellation. You may cancel your membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to your subscription service through the end of your monthly or yearly billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS. To cancel, send an email to help@bdow.com. If you cancel your subscription, your subscription will automatically cancel at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, access the store within your install and click on the Billing tab.
