Registrant's willful provision of inaccurate or unreliable information, registrant's willful failure to update the information provided to ClouDNS within seven (7) days of any change, or your failure to respond for over fifteen (15) days to inquiries by ClouDNS concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with the domain registration shall constitute a material breach of this contract and be a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain registration.

If domain registrant intend to license the use of a domain name to a third party, you are nonetheless the registrant of record and are responsible for providing your own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name. A licensing use of a domain according to this provision shall accept liability for harm caused by wrongful use of the domain unless it discloses the current contact information provided by the licensee and the identity of the licensee within seven (7) days to a party providing the domain registrant reasonable evidence of actionable harm.

If you purchased a domain through our aftermarket service, you are obliged to change the registrant of record to your own registrant details, within seven (7) days of the purchase. If you do not change the registrant details, we reserve the right to lock your domain until you comply with the requirement. Our support team will assist with the manual changes.
