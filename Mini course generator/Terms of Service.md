Payment Terms and Conditions
============================

#### Mini Course Generator | Payment Terms and Conditions  

We ask you to pay to use some parts of our service. These terms and conditions explain how that works.   

Confused? Got questions? Fill out our [Contact Form](https://minicoursegenerator.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new) or send us an email at [\[email protected\]](https://share.minicoursegenerator.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we’ll get in touch with you.  

#### What do you charge money for?

We charge you to use some parts of our service—the Premium plan, to give one example.  

#### Do you ever change your prices?  

Yes, that might happen. We can change the price at any time—we have to give you notice first.

If you carry on using our service after changes come into effect, you automatically agree to the new price. What you then pay is not refundable, unless the law says it is.

If you don’t pay, we might suspend or delete your account—which means you could lose data.  

#### Can I pay in gold doubloons?  

No. But you can pay with a credit or debit card. Payment must be made at the time of subscription to the plan or add-on.

We have no access to payment data, and we don’t store that information. Only the company processing payments has access to this—they’re certified as a PCI Service Provider Level 1.

Please make sure your payment information is up-to-date. If payment isn’t processed, we might suspend or delete your account.  

#### What happens if I run out of responses?  

You can opt to activate an automatic auto-upgrade feature to avoid being blocked from collecting more responses, in case you ever reach your plan's limits. If you activate it, we will take care of making sure that everything is in order, and you will be charged for the plan to which you are moved to.  

#### How do you invoice?  

We invoice every month or year—depending on how you decided to pay. We invoice in advance. We’ll send invoices to the email address you provided when you created your account.

Can I get a refund if I cancel my subscription or delete my account?

Sorry, no. If you cancel or delete before your subscription’s end date we can’t refund you or grant any credit.
