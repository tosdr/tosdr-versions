#### What are cookies?

#### What types of cookies do we use?  

We use our own cookies and some trusted third-party cookies too. With all of the cookies in our jar, you can choose to limit or block them—but the site might not work as smoothly. Here are the cookies you’ll find on our site:

**Cookies that remember your settings** allow our site to change based on your actions e.g. language choices and layout.  

**Cookies that measure website use** help us understand how people use our site and interact with it. They give us information like how many times you’ve visited our page, what browser you’re using, and if you’re on your phone or laptop.  

**Cookies that help with our communications and marketing** are used to show you offers, adverts, and general marketing on the rest of the web, and some of them are similar to cookies mentioned above—they analyze how you, and others, use our website
