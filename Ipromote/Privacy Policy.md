Last Update: 07/09/2024

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices of iPromote.

2KDirect, Inc., a Delaware corporation, doing business as iPromote, ("we", "us" or "iPromote") are very concerned about end users' ("Users", "End Users", "Web User" or "Web Surfers") privacy. To this end, we provide you with this Web User Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain to you about our data collection and protection practices when you access, use, interact or engage with our website and/or services. This Privacy Policy also relates to iPromote’s obligations under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, shall jointly be referred as: “DPF Obligations”).

Please note that this Privacy Policy is an integral part of our Terms of Use (available at: [https://www.ipromote.com/terms/](https://www.ipromote.com/terms/)). If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and to the data collection practices we describe here, please do not use or in any other way engage with our services. Please make sure you read the Privacy Policy carefully, understand it and consent to its terms.

#### iPromote and The Collection of Personal Information (Notice)

The term "Personal Information" means information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify a natural person, (e.g., first and last names, email address, phone number and contact information). In some jurisdictions, Personal Information may also include your IP address.

#### A. Type of Data: IP and Technical Non-Personal Data

When a Web Surfer engages with our ads, iPromote, itself or through its partners, or third parties that we have contractually engaged with, collect certain types of data that enable iPromote to provide its services:

* Browser information: type, settings, language and cookie information;
* Device, and connection information: device manufacturer, its model, its operating system information including its version and type of connection, its IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, the device's unique identifiers, geolocation marker and Internet service provider;
* Information about your activity: visits to our or our Entities' apps and pages and statistical information on the number of visits or use, ad views, ad clicks, the ads location and type and retargeting data, which reveals previous interest in a product, app or website;

Web surfers who receive ads served by iPromote retain their anonymity where iPromote is concerned. For our ad serving service, iPromote does not collect self-identifying information.

**Purpose:** iPromote collects the aforementioned data to provide our services. The IP address of an end user interacting with our services is retained separately from other data items, which prevents the possibility of identifying a specific user.

We may collect personal information from our business partners such as their persons of contact information, which includes their full names, telephone number and email address.

Any personal information that a user voluntarily provides to an Advertiser is subject to the privacy policy of that Advertiser. We recommend that anytime you choose to voluntarily submit personal information online, you should first visit and review the privacy policy of that site.

**Purpose:** iPromote collects data directly from you in order to use your contact details and in order to respond to your inquiry and provide you with support, assistance or any other service that you requested.

This will require you to opt-in to provide this information.

iPromote may obtain Personal Information from third parties service providers such as landing page, call tracking, and call recording providers.

**Purpose:** iPromote utilizes the aforementioned third parties to allow iPromote or iPromote clients to receive communications from the customers and analyze the received data.

**Lawful basis under the GDPR:** the collection of data for third parties is for the performance of our contract and the necessity of processing for the purposes of our legitimate interests.

#### Cookies and Web Beacons

Like most digital marketing solutions, iPromote uses "cookies" and other technologies to enhance users' experiences on the web, to deliver more relevant ads, and for ad delivery and reporting.

* Web Beacons – Web Beacons are used to help web publishers understand how visitors interact with their websites. Pixel tags are transparent images, iFrames, or JavaScript that are placed on a site. The use of a pixel tag allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tag.
