Privacy Policy & GDPR
=====================

### Bytemark is a company that respects the privacy of, and ownership of data.  
This privacy statement explains what data we collect, and for what purposes we use it.

In May 2018, the European Union began enforcing new data protection legislation called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  It's a huge step forward in holding service providers, like ourselves, accountable for how they store and use your personal data. We took the change as an opportunity to review our practices for everyone.  Most of our policies were already aligned with the GDPR’s requirements, but we did need to make a few changes to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
