Any such subsequent agreement shall be subject to this DPA. 

3.2. The Client’s instructions for the processing of the Personal Data shall comply with the Data Protection Laws and will not cause Veriff to violate any applicable law or regulation, including Data Protection Laws. The Client acknowledges that Veriff is neither responsible for determining which laws are applicable to the Client’s business nor whether Veriff’s provision of the Service meets the requirements of such laws. Veriff shall inform the Client in case Veriff reasonably believes that the Client’s instructions conflict with the requirements of the GDPR, and Veriff has the right to refuse to perform instructions that are not in compliance with the GDPR. In case the Client’s instructions exceed the scope of the Agreement or the DPA, or presume extra development efforts from Veriff, prior to fulfilling the instruction, the Parties may agree on additional fees that may be payable to Veriff.

3.3. The Client shall ensure its compliance with Data Protection Laws in relation to the Personal Data disclosed to and exchanged with Veriff in accordance with this DPA (for the Service and for the Permitted Business Purposes), including the accuracy and lawfulness of processing the Personal Data by the Parties, the provision of all informative notices and disclosures to the End Users and references to Veriff (including to Veriff’s  privacy policy) as required under Data Protection Laws. 

3.4. The Client warrants that prior to making the Service accessible to its End Users and disclosing the Personal Data for the Service and the Permitted Business Purposes it has an appropriate legal basis under Data Protection Laws for lawful processing of the Personal Data by Veriff in accordance with this DPA. The Client acknowledges that having an appropriate legal basis may include, but is not limited to, obtaining consents and publishing retention periods for processing the End User’s Personal Data (including document and biometric data), if required under Data Protection Laws. Upon Veriff’s reasonable request, the Client will promptly provide Veriff with proof of having the appropriate legal basis, disclosures, consents, and retention policies required, as necessary, for lawful processing in accordance with the DPA.   

3.5. When processing Personal Data of a child, the Client shall secure any legally required consents, including, but not limited to, full and lawful consents from the legal guardian over the child for the processing or authorized the processing in another manner, as required under Data Protection Laws. 

3.6. The Client shall inform Veriff of unauthorized Sessions after which Veriff shall, upon Client’s instructions, delete or apply other technical measures to the related Personal Data processed by Veriff or any sub-processors.

Veriff has the right to delete, blur, make it Deidentified Data, or make unreadable in any other way the Personal Data that may not be processed pursuant to applicable laws.  

4\. Sub-processors
------------------

4.1. The Client provides a general authorization for Veriff to engage sub-processors to process the Personal Data, provided that (i) Veriff enters into a written agreement with the sub-processor; and (ii) the written agreement with the sub-processor is not materially less protective to Personal Data than this DPA. When requested by the Client, Veriff shall inform the Client of all current sub-processors used by Veriff. An up to date list of sub-processors is available on Veriff’s website, currently at [https://support.veriff.com/en/articles/6700698-sub-processors-used-by-veriff](https://support.veriff.com/en/articles/6700698-sub-processors-used-by-veriff).

4.2. Veriff shall notify the Client of any changes to the sub-processors it uses to Process Client Personal Data (including any addition or replacement of any sub-processors). If the Client does not approve of a new sub-processor, then the Client may give notice to terminate the Terms providing at least fourteen (14) days written notice to Veriff. Veriff shall not process any refunds in case of termination by the Client on grounds of change of sub-processors, regardless of the extent in which the Client has used the Veriff Station Service, or any other circumstance. If no objection has been raised prior to Veriff adding or replacing a sub-processor, Veriff will deem the Client to have authorized the new sub-processor.  

4.3. Veriff shall at all times remain responsible for compliance with its obligations under the DPA and will be liable to the Client for the acts and omissions of any sub-processor as if they were the acts and omissions of Veriff.

5\. International Transfers
---------------------------

5.2. If Veriff adopts an alternative transfer mechanism to the mechanisms described in this DPA, including any new version of or successor to Standard Contractual Clauses, e.g. in case an Adequacy Decision or other transfer mechanism is amended or withdrawn, resulting in the inability to rely on the transfer mechanism, then such alternative transfer mechanism shall apply automatically instead of the mechanisms described in this DPA, and the Client shall fully cooperate with Veriff to sign an amendment to this DPA and/or take such other action as may be necessary to give legal effect to such alternative transfer mechanism. To the extent the Client or Veriff have adopted and certified compliance with such alternative transfer mechanism, the Client represents and warrants that the Client will comply with all legal principles and terms of such alternative transfer mechanism. In addition, in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer Personal Data cross-border, then upon request from either Party, the other Party shall fully cooperate to take such action as may be necessary to remedy such non-compliance. 

5.3. Regardless of Veriff’s processing role, if Personal Data is transferred (including disclosed via Service) to the Client outside of (i) the European Economic Area, or (ii) a jurisdiction with an  Adequacy Decision, then the Modules 1 and 4 of the Standard Contractual Clauses are hereby incorporated by reference and form an integral part of the Agreement in accordance with this DPA.
