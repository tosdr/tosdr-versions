Terms and Conditions
====================

The information below states the terms and conditions under which you may access, browse and govern your use of our website. It also states the general terms and conditions under which you use our services. If you wish to use this site, request or book travel services, please read these terms carefully as well as the Privacy Policy located [here](https://www.expobeds.com/info/privacy-policy).

1\. Reservation of accommodation travel services made with the help of a travel consultant[](#cnt-1-reservation-of-accommodation-travel-services-made-with-the-help-of-a-travel-consultant "Permalink")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.1. Enquiries, travel service reservations

Travel service requests or bookings must be sent to Expo Travel Group Ltd. by email at [info@expobeds.com](mailto:info@expobeds.com) or through any of the forms on this website. Expo Travel Group Ltd. will reply to travel booking requests on working days (Mon-Fri).

### 1.2. Cancellations, changes, no-shows, relocations

Reservations made during exhibition or other event or congress periods will normally incur full cancellation and no-show charges. Even so, a detailed and reservation-specific cancellation, change and no-show policy will be provided for each reservation to you in writing via email.

The reservation-specific terms of cancellation, changes, minimum night stay requirements are part of the offer each customer receives in response to a received enquiry. Non-refundable reservations cannot be reimbursed i.e. if you are unable to travel due to any circumstances, you will not receive a refund.

Before you confirm your booking you will be given a reservation-specific deadline for payment, cancellations, changes, minimum night stay and rooming list requirements to which you must agree before we move to the next step and issue a deposit invoice. This information will be sent to you in writing via email. If, in response to this information, you provide your company’s billing details for the invoice, this means that you agree and accept these booking conditions.

**Cancellation deadline** - unless otherwise specified the cancellation deadline is the end of business (17:00h Central European Time) on the date mentioned in the booking conditions you receive for each confirmed travel reservation.

**A minimum night stay** requirement (if applicable) is part of the hotel booking conditions and will be mentioned in the reservation-specific terms. The customer is required to pay and is not entitled to a refund for any unused nights which are covered by the minimum night stay requirement. Changes / amendments - unless otherwise specified, the customer may change the number of booked rooms, the type of booked rooms and the arrival / departure dates of the booked rooms in accordance with the reservation-specific booking conditions to which the customer has agreed before paying the reservation. Any request for changes must be communicated only to Expo Travel Group and not to the hotel directly. Any requests for changes after the final amendments deadline has passed cannot be guaranteed and confirmed and are subject to full cancellation charges. Expo Travel Group Ltd. , to the best of its ability, will aim to help the customer and provide assistance in processing any requests for changes to an already confirmed booking even after the deadline for these changes has passed. We cannot guarantee that the hotel/supplier will accept and process these changes and we take no responsibility for any losses or claims that the customer may have as a result of a request for change received after the amendment deadline not being honoured by the hotel/supplier.

**Relocation** - in the unlikely event of a confirmed hotel booking becoming unavailable due to one or more reasons such as: technical mistake in the transmitting of the hotel reservation to the supplier/hotel, a mistake in the hotel reservation system which can cause an overbooking (more rooms sold by a hotel for a particular period of stay than the hotel room capacity), parts of a hotel or an entire hotel closing for renovation, etc. Expo Travel Group Ltd. will endeavour to either provide alternative accommodation of a similar standard and location or of a similar standard with a different location, or provide full refund of the total booking price which the customer has prepaid. In cases where Expo Travel Group Ltd. has prior notice from a supplier or a hotelier regarding a relocation situation, we will immediately contact the customer to inform them. Expo Travel Group Ltd. accepts no liability for any losses or costs that might occur as a result of a confirmed reservation becoming unavailable due to a mistake made by the supplier/hotel.

### 1.3. Payment

Expo Travel Group Ltd. offers two methods of payment: credit card or bank transfer. The total amount of a confirmed booking has to be prepaid to Expo Travel Group Ltd. prior to the actual travel date.

* In the case of a customer making a payment by credit card we may charge a service fee of 2.5% of the total booking price. We will inform you in advance in any such occasions before preparing the invoice and will ask for your approval.
* In the case of a customer making a payment by bank transfer Expo Travel Group Ltd needs to receive the exact amount mentioned on the invoice as payable. Any bank charges and bank fees need to be covered by the sending party, so that Expo Travel Group Ltd. receives the correct amount indicated as payable on the invoice.
* Expo Travel Group Ltd.‘s customers may be required to present a valid credit/debit card to the hotel staff on arrival to secure any potential or actual additional charges and extra services incurred during the guests’ stay (i.e. meal charges, parking costs, phone bills, room service, minibar, etc.). If Expo Travel Group Ltd.‘s is charged or invoiced by the hotel, or supplier in relation with any costs incurred by a customer, which are not part of this customer’s confirmed and prepaid booking with us, we reserve the right to invoice the customer for these costs.

### 1.4. Invoices

Expo Travel Group Ltd. issues its invoices in Euros. All invoices are due and payable immediately upon receipt from the customer unless otherwise specified on the invoice. Any unpaid invoice within the due date mentioned on the invoice may result in cancellation of a travel reservation.

### 1.5 Taxes

The accommodation prices we quote are inclusive of local taxes, unless otherwise specified in the offer you will receive by us via email. Some cities impose an additional local/tourist/city/cultural tax, which in some occasions is, or is not payable by business travellers. We will inform you in any case if such additional tax is payable or not and will provide you with the necessary documentation for tax exemption, if applicable.

### 1.6. Confirmation of bookings

The customer will receive a booking confirmation and a voucher for a prepaid travel service by email once a deposit/full payment is received by Expo Travel Group Ltd.. The customer must print and present the voucher at the hotel reception upon arrival. In case of an event where the hotel staff cannot find the reservation described on the voucher there is an Expo Travel Group Ltd. emergency telephone line that can be dialed for immediate check-in assistance.

It is the customer’s responsibility to make sure that the information pertaining to the period of stay, type of rooms booked and passport names of the guests indicated on the voucher is correct. The service booked will only be provided in accordance with the details in the confirmation/voucher. Any requests for change/s to an already confirmed booking should be submitted in writing by the customer via email to [info@expobeds.com](mailto:info@expobeds.com). Guest name changes made after the end of the free cancellation period may incur an additional fee per change, depending on the policy of the booked hotel. Expo Travel Group will not take any responsibility for any problems originating from the customer making any changes to an already confirmed booking directly with the hotel instead of sending them to Expo Travel Group, as instructed above.

### 1.7. Refunds

Service refund policy will be provided with each reservation. Any customer claims for refunds will be reviewed within 3 working days from their receipt. Approval of a refund claim will be subject to the reservation-specific terms provided to the customer. Any approved refund claims will be processed to the customer within 10 working days after the check-out date of the travel service to which the refund claim applies. Any refunds that are processed to the client will incur a 35.00 EUR administrative processing fee. If you are not able to use part/s of your booking (room-night/s, entire rooms, etc.) because of an early check-out, no matter the reason, you have no right to claim a refund. However, we will try our best to contact our service providers, or the hotel directly to request a refund with absolutely no guarantees given that a refund will be approved and processed.

### 1.8. Standard of accommodation

Accommodation star ratings (where applicable) may vary from country to country and should not be relied upon alone to indicate the quality of the accommodation. The types of rooms, provided by a hotel (such as single, double), may also vary from country to country. It is the customer’s responsibility to independently check that the type of the accommodation and services provided by each hotel meet their requirements.

### 1.9. Information accuracy

Expo Travel Group Ltd. receives all hotel details, information about hotel facilities, room descriptions, etc. by the hotels, or our accommodation suppliers. We provide this information to the customer in good faith. We take reasonable care to ensure that the content of this website and our web booking tools, including all hotel information, is accurate and up-to-date. Expo Travel Group Ltd. cannot be responsible for inaccuracies, errors, omissions or misleading information contained in the hotel listings or information.

### 1.10. Complaints

Any complaint regarding the hotel stay, standard, conditions of the rooms, etc. must be communicated to a hotel representative on the spot during the stay. The hotel management must be given adequate opportunity to rectify the situation. If the hotel fails to solve the situation, please contact us via email to [info@expobeds.com](mailto:info@expobeds.com) describing your complaint in writing. We will endeavour to receive an explanation from the hotel on your behalf, however, we do not take responsibility for the standard and conditions of the hotel accommodation, nor do we take any responsibility for the behavior of any hotel staff or hotel representative during your stay.

### 1.11 Force Majeure

Expo Travel Group Ltd. shall not be held liable and will make no refund in the event of any delays, re-routing and/or additional expenses incurred by the customer which were directly, or indirectly caused by acts of Government, public strikes, airline traffic disruptions, severe weather, or any other force majeure causes beyond our direct control. In situations where an obstruction of travel is caused, or is a direct consequence of health-related issues, including, but not limited to health pandemics all existing reservations are still subject to both the general and the reservation-specific conditions provided to the customer at the time of booking.

### 2.1. Prices

All prices in our live availability are displayed per room per night and are including VAT (if applicable), unless stated otherwise. Additional local/city/tourist tax may be charged by the property on arrival. Some of the prices displayed are dynamic - depending on remaining availability during the event period, current demand for rooms and other factors. The same may lead to a change in the rate during the booking process. In such case you will be notified prior to completing the reservation and the booking will not be finalized unless you agree to the displayed price change. Prices are subject to change at any time during the booking process. Expo Travel Group Ltd. reserves the right to correct any obvious pricing errors on our website and/ or on confirmed reservations made under an incorrect price. In such event, if possible, we will offer you the opportunity to keep your reservation at the correct price, or we will cancel the booking without penalty and refund any prepaid deposits back to you. Expo Travel Group Ltd. bears no obligation to provide travel services at incorrect prices, even after a confirmation for a reservation has been generated. Special offers/ discounted rates and promotions may carry specific restrictions and conditions (e.g. non-cancellable, non-amendable and non-refundable). We recommend that you read the relevant reservation conditions in detail prior to finalizing and paying your reservation. All special offers/ discounted rates and promotions are marked as such.

### 2.2. Payment, modification, cancellation, no-show

By making a hotel reservation using Expo Travel Group self-service tool, you accept and agree to the relevant payment, modification, cancellation, and no-show policy. The same are shown during the booking process on this website and in the reservation confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or/and special offers are not eligible for free cancellation, refund, or change. Please check the reservation conditions carefully before finalizing your booking.

* **Modifications and cancellations** - if you wish to review, modify, or cancel your reservation, please refer to the confirmation email and follow the instructions. Please note that you may be charged for any cancellations and reductions of nights, or rooms in accordance with the reservation conditions to which you have agreed when creating the booking. Modifications in the arrival date/s - any such changes must be processed by Expo Travel Group and reconfirmed by the hotel.
* **Payments** - all reservations are subject to full prepayment before the actual travel date. The prepayment is payable by credit card at the time of booking – in one instalment (100%), or 2 instalments (deposit% and remaining open balance). A payment schedule for each rate chosen will be displayed to the user as part of the conditions of booking. Depending on the booking conditions of the rate chosen, a prepaid deposit may be refundable until certain date (cancellation deadline). We reserve the right to cancel any reservation against 100% penalty if the deadlines mentioned in the payment schedule are not met.
* **Credit card payments** - we process credit card payments using a 3rd party service provider using the highest standards for protection of your details. We do not store or process any credit card information on our servers. We process transactions in EUR currency. We do not have control over any transaction fees which are imposed by the card’s issuer institution. We do not have any control, nor do we take responsibility for any applicable exchange rates applied by the card issuer’s bank/institution in case the card currency is different from EUR currency. If the currency of the card is not EUR there may be a different transaction amount appearing on the user’s card statement. If you have any questions about the exchange rate applied to your card transaction, please contact your bank or card issuer.
* **Late arrivals and no-shows** - non-arrivals and early check-outs are non-refundable during trade fair periods. Please note that in case you fail to show up as scheduled, without having informed Expo Travel Group about it, the hotel has the right to cancel the entire booking against a 100% penalty. Check in and check out times vary depending on hotels regulations. In general check in starts at 3:00 pm on the day of arrival and check out is before 12:00 noon on the day of departure. Please notify Expo Travel Group Ltd. in case late arrival (after 20:00 hours) is expected. Note, that some hotels do not operate a 24h reception service. Expo Travel Group Ltd. shall not be liable or responsible for the consequences of your delayed arrival or any cancellation or charged no-show fee by the hotel/property. Early check in and late check out cannot be guaranteed and is subject to the hotels’ policies and availability. If allowed, it can incur an additional charge.

### 2.3. Multiple bookings, group bookings, bookings with various arrival/departure dates

The system allows multiple reservations of rooms booked under different payment and cancellation policies which are part of the same reservation. The users of the online booking tool are not allowed to make group bookings. Group bookings are reservations of more than 5 rooms during a certain trade fair period. If you require more than 5 rooms please use the booking request form to submit your requirements and we will contact you with a custom proposal. We reserve the right to cancel any reservations for more than 5 rooms made by the same exhibitor/visitor company via the online booking tool. If you need to book multiple rooms (not more than 5) for different dates of stay we advise you to send us a booking request instead of using the online booking system – we cannot guarantee that availability and prices would be valid for different booking periods during the same event. For best overview and accurate quotation please contact us with more complex booking requests.

### 2.4. Names of travellers

To create a reservation and issue a valid hotel accommodation voucher we need the full names (first and last names according to traveler’s passport) of all travelers. Hotel vouchers can only be issued directly under the travelers’ names; vouchers cannot be issued under a company name, or a group name. If you need to change a guest name you must do so by contacting Expo Travel Group directly. Do not contact the hotel with such requests as this may lead to technical problems when we finalize your booking and subsequently to a cancellation of your booking against 100% penalty. Any guest name changes will only be considered valid if they are confirmed by Expo Travel Group Ltd.

### 2.5. Confirmation of bookings

The customer will receive a booking confirmation voucher for a prepaid travel service by email once the booking is completed. The customer must present the accommodation voucher at the reception of the property upon arrival. In case of an event where the hotel staff cannot find the reservation described on the voucher there is an Expo Travel Group Ltd. emergency telephone line that can be dialed for immediate check-in assistance. It is the customer’s responsibility to make sure that the information pertaining to the period of stay, type of rooms booked and passport names of the guests indicated on the voucher is correct. The service booked will only be provided in accordance with the details in the confirmation/voucher.

### 2.6. Refunds

The refund policy for each confirmed online reservation is dependent on the reservation-specific terms provided to the customer during the booking process. Any customer claims for refunds for an online booking will be reviewed within 3 working days from their receipt. Approved refund claims will be processed to the customer within 10 working days after their approval. A refund for an online booking can only be processed to the same credit card used to create the reservation. Any refunds that are processed to the client will incur a 35.00 EUR administrative processing fee.
