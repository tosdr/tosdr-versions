### Disclosure To Third Parties

We may also transfer hashed e-mail addresses of our players and account holders to third party platforms, which enables us to display personalized ads to persons on our e-mail list. This transfer is based on our legitimate marketing interests.

You can always opt-out of the transfer of your e-mail address to third parties by contacting the Data Protection Team.

CCP may disclose your personal data to law enforcement or other government officials, as CCP, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible crimes or to respond to judicial, regulatory, agency or similar inquiries.

### Aggregated Information

We may collect aggregated demographic information about our users, such as age, interests, etc. We may share certain aggregated demographic information with our business partners regarding the users of the Services.

### International Transfer Of Data

The data we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed by CCP companies at one or more destinations both inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including the Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China for any purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

Our contractors, consultants and suppliers may also be located outside the EEA.

However, we only transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA if such transfer is permitted under the applicable privacy legislation. The transfer to CCP companies outside of the EEA is based on Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.

### D. Information about children

We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under 13 years of age. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal data without necessary parental consent, please contact the Data Protection Team.

### E. How long do we keep your data?

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we are committed to retaining your personal data only for as long as it is necessary for you to use our Services or until you request to have your personal data deleted, whichever comes first.

If you request to have your personal data deleted, we will delete your personal data from your Player Account, which will render other data, such as Gaming Data, anonymous and non-traceable to you as an individual. The user generated content that you have created, such as your avatar, messages in chat rooms, on bulletin boards and other user-to-user areas may not be deleted, but you will not be associated with that content after the deletion of your Player Account personal data.

Data regarding permanent suspension of a player is kept for an unlimited period, as the player is permanently suspended from parts of our Services. In such cases, Player Account data cannot be deleted, as it is necessary for CCP to keep a record of the ban in order to prevent the player from accessing specific Services again.

We may keep your personal data for longer for research or statistical purposes. If we do, we will make sure your personal data is anonymised and non-traceable to you as a person. We may also keep your personal data for longer if required to do so for legal or regulatory reasons.

### Processing Of Personal Data Of Business Contacts

### A. What personal data do we collect about our business contacts and why?

We collect and maintain different types of personal data on our business contacts, depending on our relationship with them.

For business management purposes and to be able to reach our business partners easily, we process the following personal data on our business contacts:

* contact details, including name, place of work, telephone and e-mail address; and
* communication between the business contact and CCP.

The above personal data usually comes directly from you, or the entity you work for, i.e. our business partner. The processing of the data is based on the legitimate business interests of CCP to maintain a relationship with its business contacts as well as on CCP’s contract with its business partners where the communication is necessary for the performance of that contract.

When you visit the CCP Headquarters we may ask you to sign into our visitor management system, where you are asked to provide the following information:

* contact details, including name, place of work and e-mail address;
* photograph; and
* who you are meeting with.

You will also be asked to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement regarding any proprietary information you may become aware of during your visit.

The reason we ask you for the above personal data is for us to maintain a safe work environment at the CCP headquarters, for both our employees and guests, by being able to identify our guests at any given time.

At the CCP Headquarters, we also use video surveillance, which may record your presence during your visit.

Our processing of personal data via the visitor management and video surveillance systems are based on our legitimate interests of maintaining a safe work environment, as well as safeguarding networks, devices and other property of CCP.

### B. To whom is the personal data of business contacts disclosed?

We may share your personal data with contractors, consultants and other third parties who require such data to assist us with managing our relationship with you. Third parties who provide us with information technology and data processing services may also have access to your data, as necessary.

These third parties may be established outside the EEA. However, we only transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA if such transfer is permitted under applicable privacy legislation.

Your personal data may also be disclosed to third parties as permitted or required by applicable law.

Moreover, your personal data may be disclosed to third parties due to regulatory requirements or in order to comply with valid legal processes such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders. In addition, personal data may be disclosed or transferred to a third party in the event of a change in ownership of CCP.

### C. For how long does CCP keep data of business contacts?

We keep the contact data of our business contacts for four (4) years after the end of our contract with a business partner. If data relating to our business contact falls under book-keeping laws, such data is kept for seven (7) years, in accordance with Icelandic book-keeping laws.

We keep personal data collected via our visitor management system data, and the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements signed in that system, for as long as we deem necessary based on the nature of our relationship with you.

### How Is Your Data Protected?

We take precautions to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.

CCP’s security measures include industry-standard technology and equipment to help protect your personal data, and we maintain security measures to allow only the appropriate personnel and third parties access to your personal data.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to use/access the Services, you are solely responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone.

### How Can You Exercise Your Rights Provided Under Data Protection Legislation?

CCP is committed to ensuring your rights under the European Data Protection Legislation.

Customers can view and rectify some elements of their personal data on their online account system, or request that our Data Protection Team rectify their data. Should business contacts require the rectification of their data, a request should be submitted to the Data Protection Team.

You have the right to access the personal data CCP has collected about you and to be informed about the purpose of its collection. You may also be entitled to a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. Furthermore, you may under certain circumstances and where technically feasible, have the right to request us to transfer your personal data to a third party.

You may also have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your personal data, for example if you object to its processing, but prefer the data not to be erased.

If the processing of your personal data is based on CCP’s legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing, following which we must stop the processing unless we demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing which override your interests.

In certain instances, you have the right to have your personal data erased, such as where the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or if you withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data.

Your rights to access, erasure, restriction and portability of data are however not absolute. In those instances where we cannot accept your request, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

Please refer all requests concerning your rights to our Data Protection Team, contactable via [request@privacy.ccpgames.com](mailto:request@privacy.ccpgames.com). In general, we keep requests from data subjects for a year from their receipt. Disputed requests may however be kept for longer, if deemed necessary.

### Change Of Control

If CCP experiences a “Change of Control” (defined below), then we may amend our privacy practices as described in this Privacy Policy. We will disclose your personal data to the company or other legal entity that succeeds our operation of the Services. The privacy policy of the succeeding legal entity will then govern the personal data that we have collected from you under this Privacy Policy. However, if applicable law prohibits the succeeding legal entity’s privacy policy from governing your personal data, then this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern. “Change of Control” means any of the following events:

* a reorganization, merger, consolidation, acquisition or other restructuring involving all or substantially all of our voting securities and/or assets, by operation of law or otherwise;
* insolvency;
* a general assignment for the benefit of creditors;
* appointment of a receiver for our business or assets;
* we become subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, whether domestic or foreign; or
* our liquidation, voluntarily or otherwise.
