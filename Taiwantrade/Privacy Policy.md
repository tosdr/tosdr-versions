Claimants and Users must understand that TAITRA is not a tribunal of disputes regarding intellectual property rights.

By taking down a listing, TAITRA is not endorsing a claim of infringement. Similarly, in instances in which TAITRA declines to take down a listing, TAITRA does not determine that the listing is not infringing, nor is it endorsing the sale of the products in such cases. If a User responds to a claim of infringement by providing assurances that its content is not infringing, the User agrees that if the content is thereafter reinstated or maintained, the User will defend and hold TAITRA harmless from any resulting claims of infringement brought against TAITRA (including but not limited to court expenses and attorney fees).
