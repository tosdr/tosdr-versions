Use of Cookies
==============

Bletchley Park’s website and apps use cookies
---------------------------------------------

**Cookie Policy**
-----------------

Bletchley Park’s website and apps use cookies, and by continuing to use our website or apps you will have been deemed to have agreed to our use of cookies subject to any overriding browser settings you may have.

**1\. WHAT IS A COOKIE?**

When we provide services via the internet, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. To do this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example your computer or mobile phone. These include small text files known as cookies.

Cookies perform several functions, such as remembering who you are on a particular site (your welcome message), to keeping you logged in to your account screen on an e-commerce site (however, you should always log out if you are using a public computer).

They can help measure how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use, to follow which pages that you’ve read to see what parts of the site are popular or not and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast.

Advertising agencies also use cookies to find out if they have served you an advert from a particular brand on a site, or if you have seen a particular advert before.

In short, cookies are a way of providing statistics on site visits as well as some limited functionality that makes your site visit easier. When used properly cookies are an asset to a site visitor and a site owner. Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies but you can delete existing cookies from your browser and, by editing your internet browser options, choose not to receive cookies in future.

Please note that if you opt to disable some or all cookies, we are unable to guarantee that our website will operate.

**2\. OPTING OUT OF COOKIES**

There are a number of options available so that you do not have to store any cookies at all. You can either set your browser so that it will not accept and store any cookie, or if you have a little more time and knowledge you are able to allow only certain ‘trusted’ sites to store cookies on your computer. These sites may include us (of course!), or the site where you carry out your online banking, or possibly your favourite news service.

It’s worth bearing in mind that if you decide to delete all of your cookies, then you will likely have to re-enter all of your usernames and passwords on all of the sites that you visit, which you previously didn’t even have to think about. As we mentioned before, cookies can be a real asset to your web surfing experience.

The Information Commissioner’s Office provides some advice about cookies and their use, but it also provides a link to ‘About cookies’ ( www.aboutcookies.org ) which is run by the law firm Pinsent Masons. This website provides even more information about cookies if you feel that this page and the ICO is not enough information for you, but it also details how you might delete any cookies that you find, and it also shows you how to allow those trusted sites to store their cookies on your computer.

**3\. USEFUL WEBSITES**
