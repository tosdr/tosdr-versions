Across all of our business activities we seek to base our privacy practices on accepted principles of privacy and data protection. These principles include:

Transparent: To be open about privacy practices, policies, developments, and the details of any processing that takes place and to specify the purposes for which Personal Data is collected and processed before such collection takes place.

Fair in Processing: To obtain Personal Data in good faith by legitimate, lawful, and fair means and to process Personal Data only in accordance with the purposes for which it was collected.

Engage in Privacy by Design: To ensure we create solutions and process data with privacy at the forefront and in accordance with these principles.

The Purpose and Reach of this Privacy Notice
============================================

This Notice describes the types of Personal Data that Company may collect or process, how we may use and disclose that Personal Data, and how you may exercise any rights you may have regarding our processing of your Personal Data.

This Notice applies to Personal Data collected or processed by us online (through websites, applications, email, and otherwise) (“Online Services”); and in other situations where you interact with us, including but not limited to interacting with or visiting our sites and offices or our events (e.g., tradeshows and conferences) (such products, services, Online Services, and other systems collectively, the “Products and Services”); when we process your data as an employee of a company for which we provide Products or Services; or anywhere this Notice is posted or referenced. This Notice also applies to Personal Data that is collected or processed when you interact with us in person, by telephone, or by mail.

Company may have other unique privacy notices that apply to certain specific situations and in such instances, the unique privacy notices control.

If you provide us with Personal Data of anyone other than yourself, please note that you are responsible for complying with all applicable privacy and data protection laws prior to providing that information to Company (including obtaining consent, if required).

Please review this Notice carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by providing us your Personal Data or otherwise interacting with us, you are agreeing to this Notice.

The Company subsidiary or affiliate with whom you are interacting or who owns and operates the Product or Service is, where applicable, the entity responsible for the collection and use of your Personal Data.

=============================================

To the extent permitted by applicable law, including in accordance with your consent where required by applicable law, we may engage in the following activities:

·        We may use your contact details to contact you to determine whether you would like to initiate a business relationship with us or to send you marketing emails. If you do not wish to receive such marketing emails, you may opt out by declining to receive such emails when registering or in our subsequent communications by following opt-out instructions included in the email or at other information collection points on the Online Services.

·        We may display advertisements to you regarding Products and Services that we believe are relevant to you based on your activities on the Online Services or on other web or digital properties. Such advertisements may be shown on our Online Services or the online services of others. We achieve this by using, and allowing third parties (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn) to use certain cookies, eTags, pixels, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to track your activities on our Online Services and other online services. For more information about these activities and how to manage or opt out of them, please see our Notice on Cookies.

On certain of our websites, we use Google Analytics, to help us understand how users engage with this and other of our websites. Google Analytics may track your activity on our sites (i.e., the pages you have seen and the links you have clicked on) and helps us measure how you interact with the content that we provide. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve the sites. The reports we receive disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. Learn more about Google’s privacy practices, and exercise the opt-out provided by Google by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, or as described in our Notice on Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.

We will honor such ‘Do-Not-Track’ requests.

You should use care before posting information about yourself, including Personal Data. You acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to Interactive Features over the Products and Services. Except when required to do so by applicable law, we assume no obligation to remove Personal Data you post on our Products and Services, and your disclosure of any Personal Data through the Interactive Features is at your own risk.

=======================

Our Products or Services may contain links to other websites, applications, products, or services that are not owned or operated by Company, such as social media websites and applications like Facebook and Twitter. You should carefully review the privacy policies and practices of other websites, products, and services as we cannot control and are not responsible for privacy policies, notices, or practices of third-party websites, applications, products, and services.

Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data
========================================

Please note that in many circumstances, we cannot effectively do business with you without processing some Personal Data about you (e.g., your contact information). For example, when you contact customer service representatives, we may require you to provide information to authenticate your identity to assist you with your request. If you are unable to provide this information, we may be unable to process your request.

You may have a right under your area’s data protection law to the following rights with respect to some or all of your Personal Data:

To request access to your Personal Data;

To request that we rectify or erase your Personal Data;

To request that we restrict or block the processing of your Personal Data (including to object to the sharing of your Personal Data under other relevant laws);

This includes the right to opt-out of solicitations;

To provide your Personal Data directly to another organization, i.e., a right to data portability;

When we previously obtained your consent, to withdraw consent to processing.

You can make a request with respect to your Personal Data by completing the form located here. You can also, if you prefer, contact ConsumerCare\_USA@reckitt.com or 1-800-228-4722.

We will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly to your requests in accordance with applicable laws. We may, after receiving your request, require additional information from you to honor the request and verify your identity. Please be aware that we may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such as if we are legally prevented from doing so.

Rewards Programs
================

We offer a variety of rewards programs and sweepstakes. To the extent applicable, you may be entitled to know the nature of these financial incentives and how we value your Personal Data collected from these programs. Through these offerings, consumers provide us with some Personal Data when they opt-in to our programs. There is no obligation to opt-in and consumers can opt-out at any time. If you join a rewards program, we use the Personal Data that you provide to better engage with you. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to your Personal Data. We may award you with points for signing up for a program or participating in events. Those points can be put towards product purchases. We do not assign points based on the sharing of Personal Data. We would calculate the value of your Personal Data to our business as equal to the value of any financial incentives that you may have received through the programs. You can opt-in to, or opt-out of, our programs at any time through the same means they are offered or by contacting us at ConsumerCare\_USA@reckitt.com.

Transfer of Personal Data Across National Borders

Whenever possible, we aim to anonymize the information or remove unnecessary identifiers from records that we may need to keep for periods beyond the specified retention period.
