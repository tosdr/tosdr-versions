Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" or IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the StreamGuys, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site.  
Our Web servers also collect information about the type of Internet browser you are using, operating system, as well as which of StreamGuys's Web pages you have accessed. This information is used to help our team develop Web sites to display properly for the majority of our visitors. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
