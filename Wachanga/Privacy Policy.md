The Wachanga Services may be used by users with User Accounts (“Registered Users”) as well as users without User Accounts (“Unregistered Users”). However, the Wachanga Services functionality may be significantly limited for Unregistered Users.  
  
The Wachanga Services collect information from both Registered Users and Unregistered Users. This information includes information that Registered Users and Unregistered Users voluntarily provide to Wachanga, including usernames, passwords, user profile information (the Registered User’s name, picture, phone number), User Content (as defined in this Privacy Policy), as well as communications between Registered Users and between Registered Users and Wachanga (for instance, as e-mails sent from Registered Users to Wachanga). When a Registered User logs into the Wachanga Services using an authorized third party social network account, such as a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account, Wachanga may collect certain information as to that Registered User’s activities and information in that third party social network. Additionally, Wachanga may collect certain technical information automatically from both Registered and Unregistered Users, including the model, manufacturer and OS version of the computer or mobile device used, MAC (Media Access Control) address, device identifiers, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), and time-stamped logs of messages sent and received, and network status (WiFi, etc.).

Information We Collect Through the Website
------------------------------------------

  
  
The Website does not automatically collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with your personally identifiable information (such as by registering for a User Account for the Services or sending an e-mail to Wachanga), Wachanga will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information when you browse the Website.  
  
When you use the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, Wachanga or trusted third parties authorized by Wachanga may collect certain technical and routing information about your computer (also known as environmental variables). When you browse the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits information to Wachanga each time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular web page you visited, your computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address, and your Internet browser version. We collect this information in order to make the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services function properly and provide you the Website’s functionality. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services and how we can better adjust the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, their contents, and functionality to meet the needs of our users. However, this information is not associated with any personally identifiable information.  
  

Providing Information to Wachanga
---------------------------------

  
  
You never have to provide personally identifiable information to Wachanga. However, should you choose to withhold certain required information, Wachanga may not be able to provide you with some or all of the Services. For instance, a User Account is necessary to enjoy all of the Wachanga Services features. Some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory or optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, you may not be able to engage in that activity. Wachanga will inform you of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required information.  
  
When you submit personal identifiable information to Wachanga through the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across international boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Wachanga and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices or web hosting servers. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Wachanga. Such vendors are contractually bound not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.  
  
Wachanga may establish relationships with various partners whose services may become available to you via the Website, Wachanga Apps, or Services, or third party websites. Typically, these partners will offer services that Wachanga users may find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services. In order to use these third-party services, you may be required to provide personal information to the partner providing the services. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide a Wachanga partner will be subject to the privacy policy posted on that partner’s website, and personal information that you provide while using the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services in conjunction with a partner’s service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. For instance, credit card or PayPal® information entered as part of the filling out a purchase form or registration process collected by a third party’s registration and/or merchant services is subject to the third party’s privacy policy. You should be aware that Wachanga’s agreements with its partners often provide that they will share with Wachanga personally identifiable information collected from you. In such instances, Wachanga may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.  
  
The partners may also use User Content in connection with commercial, sponsored, or related content, within the Website, or Services (such use referred to as “Sponsored Content”). If your User Content (including your name, username, profile picture, content, photograph, or other likenesses) is used on the Website, Wachanga Apps or Services for purposes of Sponsored Content, Wachanga will notify you of this use and provide you the option to “opt-out” of having your User Content used in this way. Also, you may choose to prevent all future use of your User Content for purposes of Sponsored Content within the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services. If you are under the age of eighteen (18) or under any other legal age of majority, you represent that at least one of your parents or legal guardians has also agreed to the terms of this section (and the use of your name, username, profile picture, content, photograph, or other likenesses) on your behalf. Parents or legal guardians of minor children whose User Content appears in Wachanga’s Sponsored Content may choose to “opt-out” and prevent all future use of a minor’s User Content in this way. If you are unsure whether your User Content has been used as part of Wachanga’s Sponsored Content and would like to find out, please contact us at [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com). Wachanga will need to verify your identity before responding to any requests so please be prepared to provide certain information such as your username, password, or other information as requested by Wachanga.  
  
Wachanga also reserves the right to use User Content in connection with its commercial activities within the Website, Wachanga App or Services, and to offer you additional Services either for a fee or without. If your User Content (including your name, username, profile picture, content, photograph, or other likenesses) is used by us in this manner, Wachanga will notify you of this use and provide you the option to “opt-out” of having your User Content used in this way.  
  

Email Communications
--------------------

  
  
You may be provided an opportunity to subscribe to periodic newsletters from Wachanga or product updates from Wachanga’s advertisers. The newsletters and product updates are marketing tools that allow Wachanga and its advertisers to inform you of services, products, and updates, as well as other news that may be relevant to you. Subscription may require you to provide your first and last name, your email address, and other information. You will be given the opportunity to choose the type of information Wachanga or its advertisers provide to you and you can opt-out from receiving updates by unsubscribing via the “Unsubscribe” link contained in the email or by either making the corresponding selection in your User Account or by request at [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com). Opting-out of these emails will not end the transmission of important service-related emails that are necessary to your use of the App.  
  
In order to provide communication services, we engage third-party service providers to carry out such newsletter services, surveys or notifications campaigns.  
  
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to the Company by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them to the Company in an email.

Wachanga encourages all of its users to sign up for User Accounts in order to access the full range of features offered by the Website, Wachanga Apps and Services.

Third Party Websites and Mobile Apps
------------------------------------

  
  
The Website, Wachanga Apps and Services may contain links to websites and mobile apps (“third-party services”) owned and operated by third parties. Such links are presented for your convenience and information. Wachanga does not control these third-party services and is not responsible for their privacy practices or content. Wachanga does not control the information collection and distribution policies on such services other than those that are under the control of Wachanga itself. Content on third-party services may not reflect products, services, and/or information provided by Wachanga. Third parties may also set their own cookies and/or use web beacons, which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had to contact these third parties. Wachanga does not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. You should direct all concerns regarding any third party service to the site administrator or webmaster of such service.  
  
In addition to Wachanga’s own advertising on the Website, Wachanga Apps, or Services, Wachanga also uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website, use Wachanga Apps or Services.

Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by the provider’s privacy policies.  
  

Information Relating to Children
--------------------------------

  
  
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/. The Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services. The collection of information from such users is covered above. Parents and legal guardians may request that we review, delete, or stop the collection of personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so by contacting us at to [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com).  
  
If you are aware of anyone under 13 using the Wachanga Services, please contact us at [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com) and we will take required steps to delete such information and (or) delete their account.  
  
Age limitation for EU residents. Due to requirements of the GDPR, you shall be at least 16 years old in order to use the App. To the extent prohibited by applicable law, we do not allow use of the App by the EU residents younger than 16 years old. If you are aware of anyone younger than 16 using the App, please contact us at [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com) and we will take steps to delete such information and (or) delete their account.  
  

Cookies and Web Beacons
-----------------------

  
  
The Website uses “cookie” and “web beacon” technology. “Cookies” are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a user’s computer. Certain pages on our Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple pages together. Cookies also enable us to customize our Website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with us. In addition, cookies are used to:  
  
• measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information; more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access;  
• identify and categorized the internet webpages from which the visitor came to the Website and observe the browsing patterns; and  
• provide functionality such as online orders, Wachanga services and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.  
  
The types of cookies that we use are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Wachanga. Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.  
  
In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our e-mails use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed and whether the site was accessed from an advertisement. There are no cookies in advertisements or e-mails. The cookie generated from the advertisement or e-mail does not contain any personally identifiable information and will remain on your hard drive until you delete it.  
  
You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our Website.  
  
Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. The use of web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website. Wachanga uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website. Wachanga may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.

Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
------------------------------------------

  
  
In operating the Wachanga Website, Wachanga Apps and Services, Wachanga may engage third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Wachanga.

We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Wachanga’s affiliates for their use without your approval.

If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner than as described herein, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.  
  

Disclosure of Information to Other Users
----------------------------------------

Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information
----------------------------------------------------

  
  
Wachanga is committed to protecting the security of your personally identifiable information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information. Wachanga operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Wachanga takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company’s security procedures and corporate policies regarding the protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Wachanga, it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Wachanga. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where Wachanga and its service providers conduct business. All Wachanga employees are obligated by our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who perform technical support of the service.  
  
A password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone.

You will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisites for our rendering such services.  
  
You can choose at any time to opt-out of receiving e-mails from Wachanga by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email you receive from Wachanga or by contacting Wachanga directly at [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com). If you elect to opt-out, we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.  
  
We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation e-mail, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements. Wachanga is retaining this right because in limited cases we feel that we may need to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. This does not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.  
  
When you create a User Account with Wachanga and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to Wachanga offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Wachanga has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We may use a third-party e-mail service provider to send e-mails to you. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send Wachanga related e-mail. If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to [team@wachanga.com](mailto:team@wachanga.com). In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail. You may also opt-out online by updating your User Account as described in the User Account section of this Privacy Policy (above).  
  
To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Wachanga with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to Wachanga when you requested services or products. Wachanga reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.
