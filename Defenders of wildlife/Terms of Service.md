Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusions and disclaimers of certain implied warranties, so some of the provisions of this section may not apply to you. 

**THIRD-PARTY CONTENT** 

Any information, statements, opinions, or other Content provided by third parties and made available on our Sites are those of the respective author(s) and not Defenders. We do not guarantee the validity, accuracy, truthfulness, completeness, reliability, or usefulness of any information, statement, opinion, or other Content on our Sites other than from an authorized Defenders representative acting in his or her official capacity.

Defenders does not make any warranty or representation regarding, or endorse or otherwise sponsor, any linked websites or the information appearing thereon or any of the products or services described thereon. Links do not imply that Defenders is legally authorized to use any trademark, trade name, logo, or copyright symbol displayed in or accessible through the links, or that any linked website is authorized to use any trademark, trade name, logo, or copyright symbol of Defenders.

**SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES** 

Defenders may maintain a presence on social media websites, including Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Care2, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Medium, and Twitter (collectively, Social Media Pages), to provide a place for the public to learn more about Defenders and to share comments. All comments, visuals and other materials posted by visitors to our Social Media Pages or Forums do not necessarily reflect the opinions or ideas of Defenders. All visitors to our Social Media Pages and Forums must comply with the respective social media website’s Terms of Use. We review some but not all postings to our Social Media Pages and may remove postings that we determine are inappropriate or offensive.  

**NOTICE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT**   

If you believe that any Content on the Sites infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may send a written notification, containing the information required under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), to our Designated Copyright Agent as set forth below.  

Designated Agent: VP of Integrated Marketing   
Email: [copyright@defenders.org](mailto:copyright@defenders.org)  

If any user of the Sites is deemed to be a repeat copyright infringer, Defenders will terminate such user’s license to use the Sites.   

**OTHER POLICIES AND TERMS** 

This Agreement applies exclusively to your access to, and use of, the Sites and does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Defenders. Additional policies and terms may apply to use of all or portions of the Sites and are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Please refer to and review all additional specific terms and conditions as applicable, including [Defenders’ Privacy Policy](https://defenders.org/defenders-wildlife-privacy-policy). 

**TERMINATION**   

The Sites and this Agreement are in effect until terminated by Defenders. In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to Defenders under applicable law, Defenders may suspend, limit, or terminate all or a portion of your access to the Sites or any of its features at any time with or without notice and with or without cause, including without limitation, if Defenders believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement concerning authorized use, intellectual property rights, disclaimer of warranty, limitation of liability and indemnity, as well as any other provisions that by their nature should survive, shall survive any such termination.  

You agree that if your use of the Sites is terminated pursuant to this Agreement, you will not attempt to use the Sites under any name, real or assumed. You further agree that if you violate this restriction after your use of the Sites is terminated, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from any and all liability that we may incur therefor. We reserve the right to have all violators prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 

**CHILD PRIVACY**  

If you are under the age of 16, please do not use or access the Sites unsupervised. It is not our intention to collect or use personal information from anyone under 16 years of age, and we will not knowingly do so. If we are made aware that we have collected any personal information from children under the age of 16 and are asked to delete such information from our databases, we will promptly do so. 

**DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY** 

DEFENDERS DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE, VALIDITY, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OF, OR OTHERWISE RESPECTING THE CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THE SITES OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES OR APPLICATION LINKED TO OR FROM THE SITES. DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE OBTAINING ANY CONTENT THROUGH THE SITES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE CONTENT OF THE SITES IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, DEFENDERS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. 

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

THE RELEASEES SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ACTS, OMISSIONS OR CONDUCT OF ANY USER OR OTHER THIRD PARTY. 

THE RELEASEES WILL ALSO NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

**INDEMNITY** 

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Defenders and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and contractors from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees), or other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of or from (a) your breach of any provision of this Agreement; (b) your activities in connection with the Sites; or (c) unsolicited information you provide to Defenders through the Sites.

If you provide us with a telephone number, address, or email address, you expressly agree that we, or our authorized agents, can use that telephone number, address, or email address to contact you. 

When you use the Sites or send emails to Defenders, you are communicating with Defenders electronically. You consent to receive electronically any communications related to your use of the Sites. We may communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the Sites. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that are provided to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. All notices from Defenders intended for receipt by a user shall be deemed delivered and effective when sent to the email address you provide on the Sites.  

**EFFECT OF INVALIDITY** 

In the event a court having jurisdiction finds any portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not be effective, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain effective. 

**WAIVERS** 

No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
