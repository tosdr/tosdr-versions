### 15\. ARBITRATION / DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR U.S. RESIDENTS

Governing Law.​ These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that these Section 15 provisions (“Arbitration Agreement”) shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Time agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Sites, any products sold or distributed through the Services or the Sites, or the Terms and prior versions of the Terms, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Time may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or Time may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.

Informal Dispute Resolution.​ There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Time. If that occurs, Time is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Time agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Time therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Time that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to [legal@time.com](mailto:legal@time.com)​ or regular mail to our offices located at TIME USA LLC, TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States. Notice to you will be sent to your email address and/or street address that Time has on file or associated to your Time account profile. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date.

The Notice must include:

(1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one);

(2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of counsel, if any;

(3) a description of the Dispute. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.

Waiver of Jury Trial. ​ YOU AND TIME HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Time are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the subsection entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND TIME AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE “BATCH ARBITRATION” SUBSECTION BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration.” Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Time agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Time from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

Arbitration Procedures. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice, you and Time agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other Disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. Any arbitration of a Dispute relating to your access to or use of the Site or Services, any products sold or distributed through the Site, or the Services, primarily for personal, family or household purposes shall also be subject to the allocation of arbitration costs and other requirements of the JAMS’ Policy On Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/](https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/). JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). A Request to Time should be sent either by mail to TIME USA LLC, TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States or by email to [legal@time.com](mailto:legal@time.com). A Request to you will be sent to your email address and/or street address that Time has on file or associated to your Time account profile. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date. The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.

Unless you and Time otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed below is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS rules.

Arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of New York and will be selected by the parties from JAMS’ roster of arbitrators with experience in consumer and/or internet industry disputes. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Request, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, JAMS will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

Authority of Arbitrator.​ The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,” including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such subsection entitled “Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief” has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled “Batch Arbitration.” The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.​ The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Time agree that in the event that there are ten (10) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Time by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Time. You and Time agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

30-Day Right to Opt Out. ​ You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/ZfGsvm1bAJNS9ubd8)​ within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Time account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

Invalidity, Expiration.​ Except as provided in the subsection entitled “Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief” above, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You and Time further agree that any Dispute must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you and Time agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.

Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Time makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to Time at [legal@time.com](mailto:legal@time.com), your continued use of the Sites and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Sites following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Sites, any Communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Sites, the Services, or these Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. Time will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.

Governing Courts.​ To the extent that the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).

Survival.​ This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.

### 16\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION NON-U.S. RESIDENTS

In the event of any Dispute you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the email address and/or street address that Time has on file or associated to your Time account profile. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to date. Your notice to us must be sent to us at [timeforeigndispute@time.com](mailto:timeforeigndispute@time.com) or to TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States. For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, TIME and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or TIME to resolve the Dispute on terms either you or TIME, in each of our sole discretion, consider unsatisfactory. Nothing in this section will prevent a party from pursuing their Disputes in court or another complaint process.

If you reside or have your place of business ​ outside the U.S., these Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with English law. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded. Nothing in the Terms shall deprive you of any mandatory protection you have under the law of the country where you live. If you are a consumer, you may bring a Dispute against us ​ in a court within a jurisdiction according to the laws of your country of residence or before the competent courts in London, England. In addition, if your country of residence is in the EU, please note that Disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the [European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&lng=EN). If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in London, England.

If you have any comments, queries or complaints about these Terms or our Services, please contact us at [legal@time.com](mailto:legal@time.com).

### 17\. NO RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there are not third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

### 18\. MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms, and policies incorporated herein, are the entire agreement between you and TIME. They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and TIME relating to your use of the Sites or Services. If these Terms expire or are terminated for any reason, the provisions which by their nature should continue after termination including Proprietary Rights, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Your Legal Liability, Arbitration/Dispute Resolution For U.S. Residents, Dispute Resolution Non-U.S. Residents, No Rights of Third Parties, and Miscellaneous shall survive any such expiration or termination. If any provision of these Terms is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply. You may not assign your rights under your TIME Account or this agreement to any third party without TIME’ prior written permission. TIME may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time. Headings in the Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this agreement. The failure of TIME to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of TIME to enforce any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by TIME or be deemed a waiver by TIME of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of TIME under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and TIME shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit TIME’ right to exercise any other right or remedy. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any of these Terms any other terms or conditions applicable to the Services, we shall determine which rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions shall control and prevail in our sole discretion, and you specifically waive any right to challenge or dispute such determination.
