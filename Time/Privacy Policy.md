This Privacy Policy also applies to any offline data collection, such as the contact information you provide to create or update your print subscriptions.

In this Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual.

Individuals from different countries or jurisdictions may have different rights with respect to their personal information. In particular, the [European Union Privacy Policy](https://time.com/eu-privacy-policy)​ applies to individuals in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand in lieu of this Privacy Policy.

### 8\. Your Opt-Out Choices

Verification Procedures: We must verify your identity for everyone’s protection. To do so, we may require you to provide us with verification information prior to accessing any records containing personal information about you. We do this by:

* Asking you to provide personal identifiers we can match against information we may have collected from you previously and confirm your request using the email or telephone number stated in the request; or

If you are a California resident, you may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. If we receive a request from an authorized agent, we require that the authorized agent verify its identity with us, that you verify your identity with us, and that you provide us with proof that you authorized the authorized agent in writing to make the request.

We will use the information you provide for verification only for the purpose of verification. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to respond to your request, or respond to it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.
