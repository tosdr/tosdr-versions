* **Description of the Surf Extension**
    
* The Surf Extension is a free browser extension that rewards you for simply browsing the Internet. You can activate the Surf Extension on most major web browsers. By installing the Surf Extension, you consent to and authorize Surf tracking and logging your internet browsing activity (“**Browser Activity**”) and sharing such Browser Activity with third parties in an aggregated or de-identified form as described in the Surf Privacy Policy. Surf may receive compensation from third parties in connection with such sharing of your Browser Activity with such third parties. You may log into your Surf Account using your User ID to view all of the Browser Activity collected through the Surf Extension in the last 30 days.  You can control the Browser Activity that Surf handles through your Surf Account, including the ability to delete any Browser Activity within 24 hours of such Browser Activity being collected by the Surf Extension (the “**Data Deletion Period**”). In the event you do not delete the Browser Activity within the Data Deletion Period, you will still be able to delete such Browser Activity in bulk within 30 days after which time the data is aggregated or de-identified so that it is no longer associated with you. In exchange for authorizing Surf to track, log and share your Browser Activity, you may receive rewards points, discount codes or other promotional offers in accordance with our Rewards Program described below.
    

* **Rewards Program**
    
* What is the Surf Rewards Program?  
    In exchange for authorizing Surf to track, log and share your Browser Activity, you may receive rewards points, discount codes or other promotional offers in accordance with our rewards program described below (the “**Rewards Program**”). Your participation in the Rewards Program is subject to these Terms of Use. By participating in the Rewards Program, you agree to comply with all applicable terms and conditions as posted on joinsurf.com and as modified by Surf from time to time in accordance with Section 1 of these Terms of Use.  
      
    Membership in the Rewards Program is limited to individuals with a valid Surf Account and is limited to one account per individual. No purchase is necessary to become a member. Customers with a valid Surf Account are automatically enrolled in the Rewards Program. Membership is non-transferable.  
      
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to terminate the Rewards Program or modify, alter, limit or otherwise change the Rewards Program at any time, including changes to benefits, membership eligibility and the structure and points system. Any such modification, alternation or change will be done in accordance with Section 1 of these Terms of Use. We reserve the right to exclude individuals from the Rewards Program for any abuse of the Rewards Program, failure to follow any of these Terms of Use, misrepresentation or any conduct detrimental to the proper functioning of the Rewards Program. 
    
* How do I Earn Points?  
    The Rewards Program is a digital, online-only, points-based program where members with the Surf Extension may earn points by using the Surf Extension.  You can earn points in the following ways:
    
    ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/60e37b6f70566d846693fa60/6335f18fd547031219d56589_Points%20Table.png)
    
    A maximum of 300 points may be earned per week from browsing. The Rewards Program works on a rolling basis, where browsing related points for missed days can be earned retroactively, up to the daily and weekly maximums.  
      
    From time to time, we may offer other ways to earn points, including through hitting certain achievements (e.g., browsing x amount of unique links, having used the extension for y hours, wish listing z items.) or participating in promotional programs.  
    ‍  
    Points accrued are non-transferable to other members or accounts and have no cash or monetary value. 
    
* How Do I Redeem Points?  
    Points are redeemable for gift cards or specific products posted on joinsurf.com. A redeemed product will be provided in the form of a gift card, with a value equivalent to the cost of the product as of the redemption date. Points cannot be redeemed in conjunction with any other discount code or deal.  
      
    To redeem your points, go to the rewards page on the Surf web app when you are logged in. Choose a reward you have enough points for, and click redeem on the page.
    
* Do my Points Expire?  
    The accumulated points in your Rewards Program account will expire if your account has neither earned nor redeemed any points in the previous 10 years.  
      
    If the Rewards Program terminates, members will no longer be able to earn points but will have 10 years from the effective date of termination to use any accumulated points, after which time the points will automatically expire. If your membership is cancelled, revoked or otherwise terminated, any points in your account will expire upon the effective date of account termination.
    
* What if I Refer a Friend to the Surf Extension?  
    You may refer a friend or family member by following the instructions in the referral page of the web app and participating in our refer-a-friend program (the “**Refer-a-Friend Program**”). You must only refer individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who you believe would be interested in the Surf Extension. By submitting an email address as part of the Refer-a-Friend Program, you represent that you have the appropriate permission and consent of your friend or family member to provide their information to Surf for the purposes of the Refer-a-Friend Program. If you choose, we will send an email to your friend or family member on your behalf to tell them about the Surf Extension and the Refer-a-Friend Program. We will not use your friend of family member’s information for any other purpose without their consent. You may refer up to 25 friends or family members per day and you will be eligible to earn points on a maximum of 10 successful referrals. We may, at our discretion, suspend or terminate your access to or use of the Surf Extension or any component thereof if you violate any provision of the Refer-a-Friend Program.
