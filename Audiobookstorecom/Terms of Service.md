OTHER INFORMATION

  

Other Information We Collect

“_**Other Information**_” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or relate to you as an identifiable individual. Other Information is anonymous data.

Other Information includes:

* Browser information;
* Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies;
* Demographic information and other information provided by you;
* Aggregated information;
* Physical location.

How We Collect Other Information

AudiobookSTORE and AudiobookSTORE’s third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

* Through your browser or mobile device.

Certain information is collected by most browsers and devices, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type, screen resolution, operating system version, device manufacturer and model and Internet browser type and version.

* Through your use of an App.

When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as your location, or the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

* Through your use of an App, connected device or vehicle, including unmanned aerial vehicles.

The physical location of your device and its associated date and time is collected by satellite, cell phone tower, Wi-Fi signals or other technologies. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

* From you.

Information such as your location as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site or App.

* By aggregating information.

Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site or App. For example, we may use Personal Information to calculate the percentage of AudiobookSTORE users who have a particular telephone area code or who use an Android device or an iOS device.

How We Use and Disclose Other Information

Because Other Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Privacy Notice.

In some instances, we combine Other Information with Personal Information, such as combining your name with your geographical location. If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, such as when we combine information you provide upon registration with Other Information to provide you with personalized marketing, the combined information will be treated by AudiobookSTORE as Personal Information.

  

IP ADDRESSES

Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (“_**ISP**_”).

How We Collect IP Addresses

An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in AudiobookSTORE server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the date and time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. The amount of information sent by your web browser depends on its settings. Please refer to your browser if you want to learn what information it sends. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.

How AudiobookSTORE Uses and Discloses IP Addresses

AudiobookSTORE uses IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Site and presenting content that is tailored to your country. We use this type of information to see which web pages you visit at the Site, which website you visited before coming to the Site, and where you go after you leave the Site. We can then develop statistics that help us understand how our visitors use the Site and how we can improve it.

We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Other Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

  

THIRD PARTY SITES

This Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including the further use of Personal Information and Other Information by any third party operating any site to which the Site or the App contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site or the App does not imply endorsement of the linked site by AudiobookSTORE. We are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies or practices of any app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Site or the Apps. This Privacy Notice applies only to information collected on this Site and Appp and not to information collected on linked sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave this Site and to read the privacy notices of each and every linked website that collects your personal information.

  

DO NOT TRACK

AudiobookSTORE does not currently follow or respond to browser do-not-track signals.

  

SECURITY

AudiobookSTORE uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under AudiobookSTORE control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information. If you suspect or have reason to believe that your interaction with AudiobookSTORE is no longer secure, immediately notify us of the problem by any means described in the Contacting AudiobookSTORE section below.

  

CHOICES AND ACCESS

How you can access, change or suppress your Personal Information

If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress or delete, or object to, restrict or otherwise limit AudiobookSTORE use of, your Personal Information that has been previously provided to AudiobookSTORE, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law) you can contact us via email at customercare@audiobookstore.com.

In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from a AudiobookSTORE database or otherwise let AudiobookSTORE know what limitations you would like to put on AudiobookSTORE use of your Personal Information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in accordance with applicable law.

  

RETENTION PERIOD

We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

* The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide requested services to you;
* Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
* Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

  

USE OF SITE BY CHILDREN

AudiobookSTORE is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities. AudiobookSTORE does not target the Site or the App to children less than 18 years of age or knowingly collect Personal Information from children for the purpose of selling products or services.

  

CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER

Your Personal Information might be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or where we have engaged a service provider, including to the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“_**EEA**_”): Some non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission (“_**EC**_”) as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards. For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the EC to protect your Personal Information.

  

INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS

Depending on the laws of your local jurisdiction, you may have certain rights and additional choices with respect to your information. For example, laws outside the United States (e.g., the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other EU countries) provide individuals in such locations the right to ask us to:

* obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal information about them, and receive information about how it is used and disclosed;
* obtain a copy of the personal information, and in some cases, receive it in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or have it be transmitted to a third party in such form;
* update, correct or delete the information;
* object to the use or disclosure of the information;
* withdraw consent previously provided for the handling of the information (without affecting the lawfulness of prior use and disclosure of the information, or of uses and disclosures for which the law does not require consent); and
* obtain a restriction on the use of the information.

For example, individuals whose personal information is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) have an absolute right to opt out of our handling of their personal information for direct marketing purposes.

Many of the rights described above are subject to limitations or exceptions under applicable law.

To exercise these rights, except for the right to correct your personal information, please contact us at email customercare@audiobookstore.com or write to the following address: AudiobookSTORE.com, 6209 Mid Rivers Mall Dr., Suite 303, St. Peters, MO 63304. If you wish to exercise your right to correct your personal information, or raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal information, please contact us at email customercare@audiobookstore.com. Individuals also have a right to file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority, but we invite you to kindly first give us an opportunity to address your concern.

  

SENSITIVE INFORMATION

We ask that you not send AudiobookSTORE, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (for example, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Site or App or otherwise to AudiobookSTORE.

Disputes

**PLEASE READ THE BELOW SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**

Except for any claim or dispute in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court, you and AudiobookSTORE waive your rights to: (a) a trial by jury; and (b) to having any claim or dispute arising out of or related to the Terms, Services or the products purchased through the Services or otherwise resolved in court. Instead, you and AudiobookSTORE agree to resolve any claim or dispute arising out of these Terms, the Services or the products purchased through the Services or otherwise through final and binding individual, confidential arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in St. Louis, MO, or any other location AudiobookSTORE agrees to.

All claims and disputes arising out of or related to the Terms, Services or the products purchased through the Services or otherwise must be arbitrated on an individual, and not a class, basis. Claims of more than one user cannot be brought or arbitrated jointly or consolidated with those of any other user. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.

To initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a notice requesting arbitration and describing your claim to 6209 Mid Rivers Mall Dr., Suite 303, St. Peters, MO 63304. If you or AudiobookSTORE decides to pursue arbitration, the action must be initiated within the applicable statute of limitations for such claim. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. The costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims and AudiobookSTORE does not waive the right to seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration.

If any part of the mandatory arbitration provisions contained in this Disputes Section are found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, the mandatory arbitration provisions contained in this Disputes Section will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to the mandatory arbitration provisions contained in this Disputes Section, including public injunctive relief, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration. AudiobookSTORE reserves all rights and remedies available to it, in law or equity, with respect to any matter relating to these Terms.

Opt-out. You may opt out of the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Disputes Section. If you do so, neither you nor AudiobookSTORE can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify AudiobookSTORE in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on an individual basis in accordance with these Terms. Your notice must include your name and address and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of the mandatory arbitration provisions in these Terms. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: AudiobookSTORE, Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 6209 Mid Rivers Mall Dr., Suite 303, St. Peters, MO 63304, or email the opt-out notice to content@audiobookstore.com.

Indemnification

Other Provisions

AudiobookSTORE.com's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.

Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms.

AudiobookSTORE may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you.

If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining condition. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
