Least Authority TFA GmbH (“**Least Authority**”, “**we**”, “**us**”) is committed to protecting your privacy while you use Least Authority’s website, products and/or services. We want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it,  how that information is used and what choices you have with respect to the information. Below is our Privacy Policy which applies to all the interactions you have with Least Authority.  However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with our services through our website, or any other third-party products, services or businesses.

I. Data Controller
------------------

The Data Controller of LeastAuthority.com and its associated services is Least Authority TFA GmbH, Thaerstraße 28a, 10249 Berlin, Germany .

II. Collecting, Processing and Storing of Personal Data and Purpose of the Usage of Personal Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We operate this website in order to provide you with information about our products and services, and keep you up to date about Least Authority.

1. **Our Website**

You may use our website for purely informational purposes without disclosing your identity. In order to display the website to you, only access data is transmitted to our provider. 

The Least Authority website is currently hosted on WP Engine servers which are based in the European Union. When using our website, WP Engine collects the following data: 

* IP address (Unfortunately, WP Engine collects logs which include full IP addresses with no option to anonymize this data.),
* Browser type/browser version,
* Operating system used,
* Language and version of the browser software,
* Host name and accessing terminal,
* Website from which the request comes,
* Content of the request (specific page),
* Date and time of the server request,
* Access statuts/HTTP status code,
* Referrer URL (the previously visited page),
* Amount of data transmitted,
* Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

Read more about WP Engine’s privacy policy here: [https://wpengine.com/legal/privacy/](https://wpengine.com/legal/privacy/).

Least Authority uses an open-source web analytics program  with a strong privacy focus, called Matomo. It informs us about how visitors use our website. Least Authority collects anonymous statistical data about the use of its website to optimize its online presence and for marketing and sales purposes. Only the first 2 ‘bytes’ of your IP address are being stored which makes it harder (i) to link your current visit to this website to future visits, and (ii) to determine your exact location.

The information Matomo ([https://matomo.org/](https://matomo.org/)) collects is:

* 2 byte masked user IP address 
* Date and time of the request,
* Title of the page being viewed (Page title)
* URL of the page being viewed (Page URL),
* URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page (Referrer URL),
* Screen resolution being used,
* Time in local user’s timezone,
* Files that were clicked and downloaded (Download),
* Links to an outside domain that were clicked (Outlink),
* Pages generation time (the time it takes for webpages to be generated by the webserver and then downloaded by the user: Page speed),
* Main Language of the browser being used (Accept-Language header),
* User Agent of the browser being used (User-Agent header).

The Matomo software runs exclusively on the server of our website. A storage of the personal data of the users only takes place there. The data will not be passed on to other third parties. Please read Matomo’s full privacy policy here: [https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/](https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/).

You can opt-out of visitor data collection by Matomo by enabling the Do-Not-Track option in your browser. Visit to learn how.

The legal basis for the processing of the data listed above is  our legitimate interest to ensure the functionality, the integrity and security of the website (Article 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR). 

The access data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose of their processing. 

You can object to the processing at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation. You can send us your objections via the contact data mentioned at the end of this Privacy Policy.

### **2\. Cookies** 

The  technically necessary cookies we use are only applicable for administrators.

### **3\. Social Media** 

On our website we do not use social network plug-ins. However, we have a social media presence that can be accessed by clicking on the respective social media logo (e.g., Github, Linkedin, Twitter, Youtube) on our website.  No personal data is sent to the social networks before you click on the logos or links which take you to the social network’s website.

In addition, you can also “share” certain contents of our website on social networks. If you click on the “share” logo on our website, the logos of the various social networks will appear. If you click on one of these logos, you will be redirected to the website of the corresponding social network. There – if you have an account and are logged in, or if you log in – you can share the desired content from our website.

We have no influence on the collected data and data procedure of any social network. Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing of the respective network can be found in the data protection declaration of the respective network. There you will also find further information on your rights and settings to protect your privacy, when using social networks. Please note that personal data is processed by social networks not only if you are logged in, but personal data, such as your IP address can also be processed if you do not have a social media account.  We process your data with the utmost care, but assume no liability for the behavior of the operators of the social networks or third parties.

### **4\. Mailing List**

If you have expressly consented to subscribe to our mailing list, we use your email address to regularly send you updates about our work. To sign up for the mailing list, providing us with an email address is sufficient. To manage our mailing list, we use MailerLite. To inform yourself about MailerLite compliance with data protection rules please read  [https://www.mailerlite.com/gdpr-compliance](https://www.mailerlite.com/gdpr-compliance) and to inform you about MailerLite\`s security please read [https://www.mailerlite.com/legal/security-statement](https://www.mailerlite.com/legal/security-statement).

In addition, for newsletters that we send out through MailerLite, we have access to the information if and when subscribers opened the newsletter email, and if and when subscribers clicked on links in the email.

The email address you provide for the mailing list is not shared or transferred to any other parties besides MailerLite. 

The legal basis for this processing is your consent (Article 6 para. 1 (a) GDPR) and, in order to prevent the misuse of your personal data, our legitimate interest in the prevention of fraud(Article 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR). If you no longer wish to receive our emails you can unsubscribe from our mailing lists at any time using the link at the bottom of any email sent using MailerLite, or contact us at contactus@leastauthority.com. We remove people that have unsubscribed from the mailing list of MailerLite on a monthly basis. Afterwards, it will take MailerLite another month to delete your data from the platform. We process the data until you exercise your right of revocation by canceling the mailing list subscription.

This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide them. Please inform yourself about Calendly’s privacy policy here [https://calendly.com/privacy](https://calendly.com/privacy).  

We delete the collected data that we collect when you contact us, after the processing is no longer necessary, which is usually  when we properly addressed the issue or, if applicable, after the expiry of the legally binding storage obligations, or if you object to further processing.  For example, the data required under commercial and tax law, we store for the legally specified periods, usually ten years (see Section 257 HGB, Section 147 AO)

The legal basis for processing these data is your consent, as outlined in Article 6 para. 1 (a) GDPR. You may withdraw your consent given to these data processing at any time.

The legal basis for processing your job application data in order to establish a working relationship between us, is also provided in Article 6 para. 1 (b) GDPR.
