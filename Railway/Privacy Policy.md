_Business Transfers_

All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.

_Data that is Not Personal Data_

We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not share such data in a manner that could identify you.

**Cookies**

The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser, tell us how and when you visit and use our Services, analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small pieces of data– usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone or similar device when you use that device to access our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).

We only place Essential Cookies on our website. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.

To find out more information about Cookies generally, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or [https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/) if you are located in the European Union.

**Data Security**

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

**Data Retention**

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

For example:

* We retain your profile information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
* We retain your payment data for as long as we need to process your purchase or subscription.
* We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively and efficiently.

As noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under 16 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 16, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at [privacy@railway.app](mailto:privacy@railway.app).

**California Resident Rights**

If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data. Additionally, please note that these rights are subject to certain conditions and exceptions under applicable law, which may permit or require us to deny your request.

If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at [privacy@railway.app](mailto:privacy@railway.app).

For the avoidance of doubt, Railway does not sell your Personal Information; for more information, please see the “Personal Data Sales and Sharing Opt-Out and Opt-In” section below.

_Deletion_

You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested, or if deletion of your Personal Data involves disproportionate effort. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.

_Correction_

You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate Personal Data we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, if we decide, based on the totality of circumstances related to your Personal Data, that such data is correct. If your correction request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your request.

_Personal Data Sales and Sharing Opt-Out and Opt-In_

Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights when a business ‘shares’ Personal Data with third parties for purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising

We will not sell or share for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months.

_We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA_

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.

_Our Financial Incentive Program_

From time to time, we may offer financial incentives, including payments to you as compensation, for the collection of your Personal Data, the sale of your Personal Data, or the deletion of your Personal Data. These financial incentives include Usage Credits, as defined and discussed in the “Free Trials and Other Promotions” section of the [Terms of Service](https://railway.app/legal/terms). In the event we offer you Usage Credits, they will be automatically added to your account. You may revoke your consent to participate in our financial incentive program at any time by emailing us at [privacy@railway.com](mailto:privacy@railway.com). Based on our good-faith estimate, the value of your Personal Data to us is related to the value of the financial benefits provided to you (via Usage Credits), less the expense related to our offering of those financial benefits.

**Exercising Your Rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws**

To exercise the rights described in this Privacy Policy, you or, if you are a California, Colorado or Connecticut resident, your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.

We will work to respond to your Valid Request within the time period required by applicable law. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, you may submit a Valid Request by emailing us at [privacy@railway.app](mailto:privacy@railway.app).

If you are a California, Colorado or Connecticut resident, you may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.

Railway will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.

_Transfers of Personal Data_

The Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Railway and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Railway in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Railway to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. In some circumstances, your Personal Data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses and/or the Data Privacy Framework, as discussed below.

_**Data Privacy Framework(s)**_

Railway complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Railway has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of all personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Railway has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, (collectively, the “Principles”), the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [the Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Railway’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Data we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Data, and the purposes for which we disclose your Personal Data to certain types of third parties in the sections above. Pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, EU, UK, and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain Personal Data relating to them in the U.S. Upon request, we will provide EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with access to the Personal Data that we hold about them. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals may also correct, amend, or delete the Personal Data we hold about them where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. An EU, UK, or Swiss individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the U.S. under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, should direct their query to [privacy@railway.app](mailto:privacy@railway.app). If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. For more information about rights afforded to EU, UK, and Swiss individuals, please see the “European Union, United Kingdom, and Swiss Data Subject Rights” section of this Privacy Policy.

In addition, we will provide EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with the choice to opt-out to sensitive data processing before sharing their Personal Data with any third parties (other than our agents or those that act on our behalf or under our instruction), or before we use it for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to [privacy@railway.app](mailto:privacy@railway.app).

In addition to any other disclosures described in our Privacy Policy, in certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Railway’s accountability for Personal Data that it receives in the U.S. under the EU-U.S. DPF, the U.K Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf is described in the Principles. In particular, Railway remains liable under the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles if our agents process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, unless Railway proves that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the U.K Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Railway commits to resolve EU-U.S. DPF Principles and Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the aforementioned frameworks should first contact Railway at [privacy@railway.app](mailto:privacy@railway.app).

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Railway has further committed to refer unresolved complaints under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to BBB National Programs, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [https://dpfservices.bbbprograms.org/complaint](https://dpfservices.bbbprograms.org/complaint) for more information or to file a complaint. The services of BBB are provided free of charge to you.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Railway commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of human resources data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF in the context of the employment relationship.

If your complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Annex 1 of the Data Privacy Framework Principles, located at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction).
