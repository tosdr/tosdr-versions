The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. It is our policy to respond to notices and counter-notices that properly conform with the DMCA's requirements. Accordingly, notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see the Copyright Office's web page at www.copyright.gov for details of the current DMCA requirements.

If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Browserling infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted by a user on one of our message boards), you (or your agent) may send us a written notification pursuant to the DMCA, by providing our DMCA Agent with the information listed below (and as further set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)) and requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked:

Identification in sufficient detail of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works on the Services are covered by a single notification, you may provide a representative list of such works on the Services, however, the representative list must still contain sufficient detail of the copyrighted works so that we can identify them;

Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Services that contains the material that you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must provide us with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the alleged infringing material(s), so that we can comply with your request to remove or deny access to it/them;

Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available);

The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;

A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information contained in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice will not be valid. You must submit any notification of an alleged copyright infringement to Browserling's DMCA Agent by email at support@browserling.com.

Browserling may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete your Account with or without notice to you, at any time for any reason or for no reason, including without limitation, for violation or suspected violation of the Terms of Use. For example, your Account may be deleted and terminated without warning if Browserling believes, in its sole discretion, that you are under 18 years of age; if you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete); or Browserling has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete.
