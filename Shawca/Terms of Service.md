Most Web browsers offer an alternative way of following navigation links by using keyboard access keys. To use an access key when using Windows, hold down the Alt key and press the appropriate access key. For Macintosh users, hold down the Control key and press the appropriate access key. Internet Explorer may require you to use the Enter key to activate the link. To return to the home page, the access key is Alt+1.

All links throughout SHAW.ca use the first letter of the link as its access key. As an example, pressing Alt+A activates the link to the About Us section. If a page has multiple links starting with the same letter, you can move through the available options by holding down the Alt key while pressing the access letter key.

#### Skip Navigation Form

SHAW.ca allows people with screen reading software to jump from the top of the page to the main content of the page. This feature is available through access key Alt+X.

#### Images

All content images used on Shaw.ca are accompanied by alternative text captions describing the image if your browser supports the alt-text function. Decorative graphics have blank alt-text attributes.

#### Resizable Text

The size of text on Shaw.ca can be increased or decreased based on each user's preference.

#### Table Summaries

The Table Summary feature allows visitors with screen readers to know what the table's content is before the software begins reading.

#### Acronym Tool Tip Definitions

Where possible we have spelled out the entire name of our products and services, but occasionally we rely on acronyms when space is limited. If you need a reminder of what a particular acronym stands for just move your mouse over the letters to see the full name.

#### Documents

Documents on our website are presented in PDF format. PDF documents are generally accessible to users with screen-reading software.

Overdue accounts are subject to termination of the services by Shaw. You agree to pay Shaw $25.00 if your credit card is denied or if your cheque is returned due to non-sufficient funds. Should it become necessary to disconnect a past due account, payment of the full outstanding balance plus a reconnection charge will be required before service is restored, provided Shaw is not under any obligation to restore the services to any person who continues to fail to make timely payment of the amounts due.

You agree that Shaw may, for any reason, and without notice to you, modify or terminate Shaw Go WiFi and these Terms of Use without liability to you, any user or any third party. If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms of Use or any modifications which may be made by Shaw from time to time, do not access or use Shaw Go WiFi and immediately contact Shaw.

YOUR NONTERMINATION OR CONTINUED USE OF SHAW GO WIFI AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ANY CHANGES MADE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE AS MODIFIED BY SUCH CHANGES.

#### Access to and Use of Shaw Go WiFi

You understand that Shaw Go WiFi is a feature of Shaw's Internet service and that you must be a current subscriber to a Shaw Internet service in order to use Shaw Go WiFi. As with other Shaw services, you are permitted to use Shaw Go WiFi only for lawful purposes.

In order to access Shaw Go WiFi, you must provide your Shaw userid, password and certain other information ("**Shaw Go WiFi ID**") that may be requested from time to time. Shaw may also automatically collect certain information, such as MAC address, device location and device type, in order to provide you services and improve your service experience. You acknowledge and agree that you will be responsible for all activities during any session using Shaw Go WiFi under your Shaw Go WiFi ID. You may not provide any third party with your Shaw Go WiFi ID for the purpose of accessing Shaw Go WiFi. You remain responsible for all bandwidth usage incurred utilizing your Shaw Go WiFi ID as well as any account changes that may be imposed as a result of your bandwidth usage as set out in the Terms of Use, and agree to pay any applicable fees charged to your account for the use of Shaw Go WiFi, plus any applicable taxes and other fees imposed as a result of these Terms of Use.

You may use Shaw Go WiFi solely for your own lawful personal purposes. You may not in any way distribute, resell or otherwise provide third parties with access to or use of Shaw Go WiFi.

#### Performance of Shaw Go WiFi

In order to use Shaw Go WiFi, you must have a Wi-Fi capable device that:

The Wi-Fi device must be in close enough proximity to Shaw Go WiFi wireless access points to achieve connectivity with the Shaw Go WiFi network. Shaw Go WiFi access location lists and maps may be updated from time-to-time. Actual Shaw Go WiFi coverage, locations and quality may vary.

Shaw will endeavour to provide useful and reliable Shaw Go WiFi services, but you acknowledge that Shaw Go WiFi utilizes public, unlicensed radio-frequency spectrum. As such, Shaw Go WiFi is subject to external interferences, environmental influences, and other factors and variables beyond Shaw's reasonable control. Performance and availability may vary, including but not limited to or affected by,

a. transmission and download speed and accuracy;  
b. network congestion;  
c. performance, configuration, and functionality of your Wi-Fi devices and wireless cards (including, but not limited to memory, storage and other limitations);  
d. physical obstructions and distances between your WiFi device and the Shaw Go WiFi network;  
e. availability of electric power;  
f. collocation failures;  
g. transmission and equipment limitations, failures, maintenance or repair; and  
h. user error.

Shaw Go WiFi may also be interrupted, refused, limited or curtailed for these reasons. Shaw is not responsible for data lost or misdirected due to these and other foreseeable and unforeseeable factors. Network speed is an estimate and is no indication of the speed at which your Wi-Fi device or Shaw Go WiFi will operate. Actual network speed and other performance will vary.

In order to maintain acceptable levels of service for all Shaw Go WiFi customers and to improve this service, Shaw reserves the right to monitor use of Shaw Go WiFi and to make such adjustments to the use of such services as necessary to maximize the benefit and enjoyment for all Shaw Go WiFi customers. Additionally, the Shaw Go WiFi service may use automated processes to monitor and scan communications over the Shaw Go WiFi network in order to maintain and provide services, improve your experience, ensure the integrity of your communications, convey messages related to your Shaw Go WiFi account, deliver relevant advertising and for various other purposes related to the provision of Shaw Go WiFi services. By using the Shaw Go WiFi service, you acknowledge and consent to Shaw's automated processing of your communications through the Shaw Go WiFi network, including information such as your IP or MAC address, Shaw Go WiFi ID, device location, HTTP requests and other information related to the provision of this service.

#### Service Subject To Interception and Unauthorized Use

You acknowledge that communications over the Shaw Go WiFi network may be subject to interception by unauthorized third parties. Although Shaw uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with a secure and reliable service, your use of Shaw Go WiFi is "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and Shaw cannot and does not make any general or specific warranties regarding the security, availability, performance or other functionality of Shaw Go WiFi. You are responsible for implementing your own security protections while using Shaw Go WiFi. In the event you become aware of any unauthorized use of Shaw Go WiFi or any other security breach (including but not limited to third-party use of your Shaw Go WiFi ID and password), you agree to immediately notify Shaw. Shaw expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability for your use of Shaw Go WiFi and for any lack of security that may result from your use of Shaw Go WiFi. You agree to hold Shaw harmless for the loss of any file, data or other information while using the Shaw Go WiFi services, and for any unauthorized access to or utilization by any third party of any of your personal, financial, or other sensitive information.

#### Marketing and Shaw's Use of Wi-Fi Data

You understand and agree that Shaw may from time to time use location or other data generated from your use of Shaw Go WiFi to deliver general or user specific messaging or advertising from Shaw or a third party to the browser you are using to access the Internet. Furthermore, you understand and agree that the Shaw Go WiFi "watermark" bearing Shaw's logo may appear superimposed from time to time over portions of website pages you visit, that the watermark is intended solely to identify Shaw Go WiFi as the source of your wireless Internet access service, and that this in no way indicates Shaw's approval of or responsibility for the content of such websites, which are solely the responsibility of the website operators and/or content providers. You agree that you will not seek to hold Shaw responsible in any way for any third party website content or the operation of any third party website accessed via Shaw Go WiFi, or for the appearance of our Shaw Go WiFi "watermark" over a portion of any website.
