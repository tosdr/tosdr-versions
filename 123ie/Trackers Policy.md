Cookies \& Similar Technologies Policy

Updated July 2024



What are cookies and why do we use them?

Cookies are usually small text files stored on a

device, such as a PC, a mobile device or any

other device that can store information.

Cookies serve several important functions,

including to remember a user and their

previous interactions with a website. Our

website uses cookies to distinguish you from

other users of the website letting us know for

example when you have returned to the

website. This helps us to provide you with a

good experience when you browse our website

and allows us to continually improve the

overall website experience.



These types of cookies are set by us and are

called first-party cookies. To protect your

privacy, your browser only allows 123.ie to

access the cookies it has already sent to you,

not the cookies sent to you by other websites.

We also use third-party cookies, which are

cookies from a domain different than the

domain of the website you are visiting, for our

advertising and marketing efforts. For example,

if you visit 123.ie and the domain of the cookie

placed on your computer is 123.ie, then this is

a first-party cookie. If, however, you visit 123.ie

and the cookie placed on your computer says

Facebook for example, then this is a third-party

cookie.



Just to reassure you, cookies are not computer

programs and can't read other information

saved on your hard drive. They can’t be used to

disseminate viruses or, for example, get hold of

a user's email address. They only contain and

transfer to the website as much information as

the users themselves have disclosed to that

website. Please note that cookies are

computer-specific, so if you log on to any

website from a different computer or



smartphone, the cookie settings on that

particular device will apply.



You can block cookies by activating the setting

on your browser that allows you to refuse the

setting of all or some cookies. However, if you

do not give your consent to the setting of some

cookies and/or use your browser settings to

block all cookies (including essential cookies),

you may not be able to access all or parts of

our website. It’s also worth bearing in mind

that turning all cookies off may interfere with

your browsing experience across the Internet.

For instructions on how to manage and disable

cookies, see the privacy and help

documentation of your specific browser’s

website. If you use more devices and/or

browsers, you will need to disable cookies on

each device and on each browser individually.

For further information about managing and

disabling cookies on your computer, please

visit www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-

cookies.



Finally, we have implemented a cookie consent

preferences manager on our website which

allows you control over the non-essential

cookies that our website sets. By using this

consent manager e.g., when you first browse

our site, you can let us know whether you give

consent (or not) to the setting of the different

types of cookies that our website uses. If you

return to our website in 6 months’ time, you

will be prompted to re-consent to our use of

non-essential cookies. You can withdraw or

change your consent at any time through the

cookie banner and by clicking on the “Cookie

Preferences” link which can be found at the

bottom of our website. Any change to your

preferences will apply straight away.

Cookie Policy



Updated: July 2024 2



Lifespan of cookies

Some cookies are retained in your browser for only as long as you visit our website, while others

persist for a longer specified period of time. Broadly, these are categorised as Session and Persistent

cookies.



1. Session cookies are temporary cookie

files, which are erased when you close

your browser. When you restart your

browser and go back to 123.ie, our

website will not recognise you. A new

session cookie will be generated, which

will store your browsing information and

will be active until you leave the website

and close your browser.



2. Persistent cookies stay in one of your

browser's subfolders until you delete

them manually or your browser deletes

them based on the expiry date

contained within the persistent cookie's

file.



Types of Cookies

There are three types of cookies used on the 123.ie website:



Strictly Necessary cookies: These cookies are

fundamental to the running of this website and

must always remain enabled to ensure that the

website works correctly. Strictly necessary

cookies are usually only set in response to

actions made by you which amount to a

request for services, such as allowing you to

securely use the basic functionality of our

website. For example, generating an insurance

quote online, availing of discounts online,

paying for your policy online, renewing your

Car or Home Insurance online, accessing

MyAccount or the 123 Customer Portal to

upload policy documents online. Other

Essential cookies are considered strictly

necessary on the basis that they solely enable

the transmission of communications over a

network.



Performance cookies: These cookies allow us

to get to know how you use the website and

identify ways to enhance the website

experience. For example, 123.ie uses Google

Analytics to track anonymised usage statistics

for the site. They’re used to analyse visitor

information such as how often people visit the

site, how the website is found, and which

pages are most frequently viewed. The

information is combined with data from

thousands of other users to create an overall



view of website usage and is used to improve

the website experience for all users.



Advertising cookies: These cookies are linked

to advertising services provided by third

parties. We use cookies set by third parties to

measure the effectiveness of our online

advertising campaigns. For example, for

measuring how many unique browsers have

seen a particular ad from 123.ie and how many

of those subsequently visit our website. These

cookies ensure that any ads you see are

relevant and related to your preferences and

interests. These cookies allow us to limit the

amount of 123.ie ads you may be shown when

browsing throughout the internet. If you opt

out of these cookies, you will experience less

targeted advertising. Each third party has their

own privacy policy which will tell you how they

use cookies and data tags.

Cookie Policy



Updated: July 2024 2



Other Similar Technologies

In addition to cookies, we may use other

technologies, such as:



Social widgets: Social widgets are buttons or

icons provided by third-party social media

providers (for example a social media

website) that allow you to interact with

those social media services when you view a

web page. These social widgets may collect

browsing data (data about what pages you

are viewing, what links you are clicking on

etc.), which may be received by the third

party that provided the widget, and are

controlled by the third parties.



Web Beacons (Pixels): Web beacons are

snippets of programming code or included in

web pages, emails, and ads that notifies us or

our trusted third-party service providers

when those web pages, emails or ads have

been viewed or interacted with.



UTM Codes: UTM codes are strings that can

appear in a URL (the Uniform Resource

Locator, which is typically the http or https

address entered to go to a web page) when a

user moves from one web page or website to

another, where the string can represent

information about browsing, such as which

advertisement, page, or publisher (a website

that included an advert) sent the user to the

receiving website (the website the advert

was about). These codes may also be used in

emails to track user engagement and

campaign performance.



Local Storage: Local storage objects are sets

of data that can be stored on your browser

by a site. They can be used to maintain

preferences, a history of your usage, or even

the state or settings of a site.
