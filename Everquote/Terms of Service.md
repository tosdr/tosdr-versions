**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE.**

By accessing EverQuote.com, using any of our services and/or accessing and using any other websites on which these Terms and Conditions reside (collectively also referred to herein as the "Site"), or any of the Site's Content (as defined below), you acknowledge that you agree to and are subject to the following Terms and Conditions, including without limitation, binding arbitration (described in Section 2 below), the EverQuote [Privacy Policy](https://www.everquote.com/privacy-policy/), E-Sign Consent, and any operating rules, policies, and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site (collectively, the "Terms"). NOTE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN US AND YOU AND THAT LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or otherwise use the Site or the Content. The Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us, EverQuote.com, the operator of the Site (hereafter referred to as "we", "us" or "our"). References in these Terms to "Site operator," "we", "us" and "our" include our affiliates (including, without limitation, EverQuote, Inc.), agents, successors and assigns. The Site is available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Site is intended for and made available only to residents of the United States, age 18 or older. By accessing and using the Site, you accept and agree to, without qualification, the Terms and represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the User (as defined below) to these Terms and that your use of the Site, including the provision or use of any Content, does not violate any applicable law.

### 1\. Our Services

The Site acts as a portal to facilitate insurance agents, insurance companies, lead aggregators and other similar parties (each a "Provider") to offer for sale and to sell, insurance and other products to potential consumers who have applied through the Site to receive insurance or other authorized quotations from a Provider (each, a "Prospect"), and all Prospects and potential Prospects that use the Site are collectively called the Site's "Users" (and hereafter may be referred to as "you" or "your"). We may, with a Prospect's authorization, collect certain information (a "Lead") about a Prospect and sell the Lead to a Provider. We are not responsible for the legality, safety or quality of the products offered for sale by a Provider, the accuracy or veracity of the representations regarding the products, the ability of Providers to sell the products or the ability of Prospects to pay for the products. For all purposes we are an independent contractor. With the exception of certain life insurance transactions, we do not issue insurance contracts or bind coverage. We are not responsible for, nor do we assume any financial or other liability whatsoever, for the conduct of any Prospect or Provider. With the exception of certain life insurance transactions, we do not endorse or recommend any Providers or insurance policies or other related products offered by such Providers. With the exception of certain life insurance transactions, we do not provide any type of insurance, tax, financial, legal or any other advice. We do not guarantee that any Providers to whom we send a Prospect's application will contact the Prospect or agree to provide the Prospect with the requested insurance coverage. If you would like personal advice or insurance specific policy recommendations, please consult with a qualified professional. Be advised that we do not offer or sell any insurance or other products shown on the Site.

### 2\. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.** You agree to attempt in good faith to settle any dispute or claim that has or may arise between us, which arises out of or relates in any way to these Terms or your use of the Site or the Content, including, without limitation, any dispute or claim between you and a Provider (each, a "Claim"), by way of consultations between you and us, which consultations will be initiated upon written notice by any party to the other (the "Consultation Notice"). The Consultation Notice must describe the nature and basis of the Claim and set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If such Claim cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days after the Consultation Notice is received, any party to the consultations may initiate an arbitration proceeding upon written notice to the other party in accordance with this Section 2. Any notice to us under this Section 2 should be addressed to: [\[email protected\]](https://www.everquote.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) ("Notice Address").**You agree to arbitrate all Claims between you and us, or any Provider, that cannot be amicably resolved in accordance with the foregoing paragraph.** This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (a) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of your relationship with us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; and (b) claims that could be alleged as class action Claims (and you agree to waive the right to participate in a class action in accordance with this Section 2). For the avoidance of doubt, references in this Section 2 to "Site operator," "Provider," "we", "Prospect", "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the services, information or Site Content available through the use the Site. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing an individual action in small claims court if your claims qualify, and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. Further, this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Trade Commission. You agree that, by entering into this arbitration agreement, you and we are each waiving our respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action, and that arbitration of disputes pursuant to this Section 2 shall be in your individual capacity. THIS MEANS YOU ARE LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE, COMBINE, OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. You acknowledge and agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

The arbitration will be governed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its then-prevailing rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement (but expressly excluding the Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitration and any other AAA Rules that conflict with the waiver of class arbitration and representative proceedings below), and will be administered by one (1) arbitrator with relevant industry experience appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The AAA Rules are available at [https://www.adr.org/Rules](https://www.adr.org/Rules) or by calling (800) 778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall apply Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, without limitation, issues relating to the applicability and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the arbitration, any arbitration hearings under this Section 2 will take place in the county where you are domiciled. If your Claim is for $5,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your Claim exceeds $5,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for in this Section 2, in any arbitration between you and us under this Section 2, all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above where Claims for damages do not exceed $10,000 shall, at your written request, be paid by us. Any request for payment of fees by us shall be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other Users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same User to the extent required by applicable law.

With the exception of the provision in the preceding paragraph prohibiting class arbitration or representative proceedings, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 2 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 2 shall still apply to the maximum extent possible. In the event that the foregoing prohibition on class arbitration or representative proceedings is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 2 shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms, including, without limitation, Section 16 (Choice of Law and Forum), will remain in force.

You may opt-out of this arbitration provision only by written notice to us at the Notice Address ([\[email protected\]](https://www.everquote.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) within thirty (30) days of your acceptance of this agreement, which notice shall include your name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration.

If we make any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your relationship with us, that change shall not apply to any Claim against us initiated prior to the effective date of the change. The change shall apply to all other Claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us. We will notify you of changes to this arbitration provision by posting the amended terms on the Site or by email, in each case at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, Providers shall be third party beneficiaries of the rights to dispute resolution and arbitration set forth in this Section 2, and each Provider shall have the right to enforce this Section 2 against Users as if such Provider were a party to the agreement set forth in this Section 2 in the event of any dispute or claim between you and such Provider based on or relating to any transaction or interaction between you and such Provider that is enabled by or arises in connection with your use of the Site.

* If you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add @everquote.com to your email address book.
* You understand that you may request paper copies of the Disclosures, and that we will provide them to you by mail at no charge. You can request paper copies and/or withdraw consent by contacting us at: EverQuote, Inc. 210 Broadway, Suite 302 Cambridge, MA 02139

Any withdrawal of your consent to receive electronic Disclosures will be effective only after we have a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal. You understand and agree that if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic Disclosures, we may—though we are not obligated to—cancel your account.

At any time, you can update the email address to which we will send alerts that Disclosures are available. You can change your email address by contacting us at: [\[email protected\]](https://www.everquote.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

By consenting, you agree that electronic Disclosures have the same meaning and effect as if we provided paper Disclosures to you. When we send you an email or other electronic notification alerting you that Disclosures are available electronically and we do in fact make them available online, that shall have the same meaning and effect as if we provided paper Disclosures to you, whether or not you choose to view the Disclosures, unless you had previously withdrawn your consent to receive Disclosures electronically. You understand and agree that Disclosures are considered received by you within 24 hours of the time posted to our website, or within 24 hours of the time emailed to you unless we receive notice that the e-mail address is invalid.

You understand and agree that we reserve the right to cancel this electronic Disclosure service, change the terms of use of this service or send Disclosures in paper form at any time.

You understand and agree that we are responsible for sending notice of the Disclosures to you electronically including at the email address you have provided, but are not responsible for any delay or failure in your receipt of the email notices.
