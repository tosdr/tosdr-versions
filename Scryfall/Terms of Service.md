**We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read:** When we say “Scryfall” we mean the Scryfall website, API, chat bots, chat rooms, and other related services. When we say “we” or “us” we mean Scryfall, LLC, a United States company. When we say “content”, “your content”, or “post” we mean any information you submit or store on Scryfall services, including account names, deck information, and chat messages.

**We may modify these terms at any time.** We’ll try not to, but just know that we can change these terms at any time. If the changes are material, we’ll let you know by email or by posting a notice before the changes go into effect. The notice will designate a reasonable amount of time after which the new terms will go into effect for all users. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you may delete your account and stop using Scryfall. If you do not delete your account or do not stop using Scryfall within the notice period, your content and use of the site will be subject to the new Terms of Service going forward.
