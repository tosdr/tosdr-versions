We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

  

**SECTION 2 - ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS AND TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION**

We are not responsible if information made available on this Site is not accurate, complete, or current.

Certain products, services, or materials sold or made available through this Site may be subject to separate or additional terms and conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Terms, the provisions of the additional terms will govern.

  

We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of our products that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee that your device's display of any color will be accurate, nor that a given product will have the exact color or shade displayed except to the extent expressly promised on that product’s page.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of products, services, or pricing are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product or service at any time.

We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household, or per order.

In the event that we change or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e‑mail, billing address, or phone number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BOSU CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE AGAINST VIRUSES, WORMS, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED USERS OR HACKERS ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO THIS SITE OR INFORMATION TRANSMITTED TO OR FROM THIS SITE OR THE WEBSITES OF BOSU’S CONTRACTED VENDORS AND/OR SERVICE PROVIDERS.

  

You agree that at any time, we may restrict access to all or part of the Site for indefinite periods of time, delete specific pages, remove certain products or services, or terminate the Site entirely without notice to you. You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Site is at your sole risk.

  

In no case shall BOSU, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers, or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, arising from your use of the Site or any products or services procured using the Site, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the Site or any product or service, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Site or any content, services, or products posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Site, even if advised of their possibility.

In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service. Any such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

  

**SECTION 17 – TERMINATION**

These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us.

**SECTION 22 – CONSTRUCTION AND TRANSLATIONS**

**The provisions of these Terms of Service shall be construed simply according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. The captions and headings used within these Terms are for convenience of reference only and will not be deemed to define, describe, expand, or limit the meaning of the language of the Terms of Service. Words such as “any” and “including” will be construed as “any and all” and “including but not limited to,” respectively. The words “herein,” “hereof,” “hereunder” and other words of similar import shall refer to the entirety of the Terms of Service and not to any particular article, section, or paragraph unless otherwise specifically provided. Words of the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall mean and include the correlative words of other genders, and words importing the singular number shall mean and include the plural number and vice versa.** Terms such as “including” are used for purposes of illustration and not of limitation and mean “including but not limited to.” Reference to any law (including statutes and ordinances) means such law (including any and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) as amended, modified, codified, reenacted, or replaced, in whole or in part, and in effect at the time of determining compliance or applicability.
