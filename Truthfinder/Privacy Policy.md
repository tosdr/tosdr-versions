#### III. COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

Cookies and web beacons are small text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. TruthFinder collects information through cookies and web beacons about your web browsing activities such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referrer page you previously visited, the time you are viewing the page, your browsing environment, and your display settings. We may use cookies and web beacons on our Site for the following purposes:

* Understanding traffic patterns and the number of visitors to the Site and other websites that we partner with;
* Understanding how you use and interact with the Site;
* Improving TruthFinder's products and services;
* Optimizing your experience on the Site;
* Providing anonymous individual or aggregate auditing, research, modeling, and reporting for our advertisers and other partners;
* Storing your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site;
* Providing you with relevant advertising and content; and
* Managing our Site.

Please note that cookies may be placed by a third-party service provider who performs these functions for us. These service providers may have their own privacy policies. You can control our use of cookies using the cookie consent tool we provide on our Site, by adjusting your browser settings, or by contacting us as set forth in “Contact Information” below. See Section 2.V, Section 8.III and Section 8.IV for more information.

#### IV. SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may share your Personal Information with advertisers and other third parties as part of our service to you. We do not share your Financial Data with these third parties, though we may share Financial Data with business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners agree to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality described in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Financial Data to carry out their specific business obligations to TruthFinder.

We also disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:

* Our affiliates;
* Service providers;

Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your Personal Information in connection with products or services we provide to you;

Law enforcement officers when appropriately requested in TruthFinder’s discretion, and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations; and

* Other third parties as necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers, or others.

Lastly, if we are involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us is among the assets transferred, your Personal Information may be shared with third parties to effectuate this activity in accordance with applicable law.

If you are a law enforcement officer seeking information from TruthFinder about one of our users, please reference our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://www.truthfinder.com/law-enforcement/) for further information.

#### V. INTEREST-BASED ADS

We may also share your Personal Information with advertisers and other third parties who may use it for advertising purposes, including to serve targeted advertising on unaffiliated third-party sites. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels, or other technologies to collect user information (e.g., hashed, de-identified data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information about your online activities on the Site or other websites over time. For example, information collected across multiple sites may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are likely to be of interest to you. To opt out of these types of ads, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative for information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members.

See [http://www.thenai.org](http://www.thenai.org/) for general information about the NAI and [https://thenai.org/opt-out/](https://thenai.org/opt-out/) for the opt-out page. You may also visit [https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=E](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) to learn about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies. Please note that you may need to opt out on each device and browser you use to access our Site.

Our co-sponsors will have the right to use your Personal Information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for the Personal Information we obtain from you to be shared with our co-sponsors, please do not participate in these co-branded offerings.

If you would like to download the Publicly Available Information that we have retained about you, or suppress your information from appearing in others’ searches, you may do so at [https://www.TruthFinder.com/privacy-center/](https://www.truthfinder.com/privacy-center/).

We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you exercise any of the rights listed above.

_"Do Not Track" / "Global Privacy Control"_: Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Additionally, some browsers or plug-ins use a “Global Privacy Control” (“GPC”), which you can learn more about at [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/). Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. However, if our site detects a GPC signal from your device, we will interpret it as either a Do Not Sell request or a request to limit the sale or sharing of personal information for targeted advertising depending on the law applicable to your jurisdiction.

_Verification and Appeal Process:_ We are required by law to take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to responding to your request. Please note that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., the maintenance of legal privilege). If we are unable to process your request via you authenticating yourself on the Site, we may verify your request by asking for information sufficient to confirm your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. Requests to exercise these rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and as permitted by applicable law. Where required by applicable law, we will notify you if we reject your request, and notify you of the reasons we are unable to honor your request.

If you are a resident of Colorado, Virginia, or Connecticut, you have the right to appeal a request we deny when we have verified your identity and still decline to honor your request. The process for that appeal will be sent to you separately if your request is denied.

_Authorized Agent:_ Depending on where you live, you may have the right to use an authorized agent on your behalf to exercise a privacy right discussed above. If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of a user to communicate with us or to exercise a privacy right discussed above, you must be able to demonstrate that you have the requisite authorization to act on behalf of the user. If you are an authorized agent trying to exercise rights on behalf of an TruthFinder user, then you can make a request on the user’s behalf by contacting us as set forth below in the “Contact Information” section. Such requests must include a written authorization from the consumer that includes the consumer’s full name, address, telephone number and valid email address used by the consumer to interact with TruthFinder that is signed by the consumer and clearly bestows upon the agent the proper authority. Alternatively, an acting agent can provide a valid power of attorney signed by the consumer on the agent’s behalf and a valid email address used by the consumer to interact with TruthFinder. In addition, for a request under the Right to Know, Right to Delete, or Right to Correct, the email address of the consumer will be used to separately verify the agent’s authority directly with the consumer.

_Refer-a-Friend, Promotions, and Similar Incentive Programs:_ We may offer referral programs, promotions such as sweepstakes, or other incentivized information collection programs. We may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide Personal Information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Site. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) Alternatively, we may ask you to provide your Personal Information in exchange for a reward or participation in a promotion. These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your information to us depends on how you ultimately use our Site, whereas the value of the referred party’s information to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately uses our Site. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program. You may withdraw from the incentives at any time. In order to withdraw from the financial incentive, please contact us as described below.

_Shine the Light Disclosure:_ California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice that identifies the categories of Personal Information that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and provides contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like this information, please submit a written request to us using the contact information below.
