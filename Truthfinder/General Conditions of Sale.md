### 3\. Arbitration

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED BELOW) THAT HAVE ARISEN OR MAY ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, RATHER THAN IN COURT.

Except where expressly provided below, you and the Company agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between you and the Company, its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, related companies, predecessors in interest, successors or assigns and any and all of their respective directors, officers, employees and contractors, that have arisen or may arise, shall be resolved by the final and binding arbitration procedures and terms set forth in this section. This arbitration provision is intended to be broadly interpreted. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to, all claims, disputes or controversies relating to (i) the Websites, the Services and Materials available on or through the Websites, (ii) the display of information about you on the Websites, Services and Materials and Background Information Services, (iii) any transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use of our Websites, communications between us, or the purchase, order, or use of our Membership Plans, (iv) the information provided in connection with our Background Information Services, and the use of our Background Information Services, (v) the issue of arbitrability, including the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, whether any of the aforementioned claims arise in tort, contract, federal, state or local statute, law, order, ordinance, regulation or other basis, and whether such claims arose prior to your agreement to these Terms or may arise after your termination of your use of the Website, Information and Services and Background Information Services (all collectively “Claims”).

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN THE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD A PREVAILING CLAIMANT ANY RELIEF THAT A COURT COULD AWARD PROVIDED SUCH RELIEF IS ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELEIF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM AND NOT CLAIMS OF ANY THIRD PARTIES. UNLESS THE PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION. You acknowledge that this PROVISION is material and essential to the arbitration of any Claims between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this PROVISION is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.

BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. In the arbitration provided for in this provision, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator, rather than by a judge or jury. ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, REVOCABILITY AND SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY THE COURT. THIS ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION, ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER, INCLUDING ENFORCEMENT OF ANY RESULTING AWARD, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (“FAA”).

The following procedures shall apply to any arbitration conducted under this section:

A. Negotiate First. In the event a party wishes to proceed with binding arbitration, it shall provide written notice thereof to the other party by registered or certified mail and shall describe in such notice (“Notice of Dispute”), with reasonable particularity, the nature and basis of such Claim and the total amount of the Claim. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the party receiving notice of a Claim shall provide a written response which, with reasonable particularity, sets forth its position concerning the Claim. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute arising from the Claim by good faith negotiations to be conducted within the thirty (30)-day period following the written response, either of them may initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein. This is a mandatory requirement prior to initiating any arbitration proceeding.

B. Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be administered by the AAA. If the AAA is unavailable or refuses to arbitrate the parties’ dispute for any reason, the arbitration shall be administered and conducted by a widely-recognized arbitration organization that is mutually agreeable to the parties, but neither party shall unreasonably withhold their consent. The AAA Rules are available online [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/).

C. Location. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall take place in the capital city of the state in which the consumer resides, but may proceed telephonically if both parties agree.

D. Cost Sharing. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. The Company will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator may award reasonable documented attorneys' fees to the party that ultimately prevails.

E. Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will decide the substance of the Claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, regardless of choice of law principles. The arbitrator will have the power to award a party any relief or remedy that the party could have received in court in accordance with the laws that apply to the Claims except as limited by the provision above requiring that claims be adjudicated on an individual basis. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall not issue a reasoned written decision.

Exceptions

A. Small Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may choose to pursue their Claims in small claims court (rather than arbitration) where jurisdiction and venue over the Company and you are proper, and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief, and so long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

B. Temporary or Preliminary Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in court. The proceeding shall be limited to determining the appropriateness of preliminary or injunctive relief only and only with respect to the claim for which such relief is sought. Any decision rendered by the court shall then be subject to review by the arbitrator should the seeking party pursue permanent injunctive relief or other Claims in arbitration.

Arbitration Opt-Out

Agreeing to this arbitration is not a mandatory condition of your contractual relationship with the Company. If you do not want to be subject to this arbitration provision, you may opt out. To do so send written notice of your decision to opt out to the address in Section 36. The opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to this agreement to arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number and email address(es) used to register with or use the Website, the related Services and Materials or the Background Information Services, as well as the name, address, phone number and email address(es) of any person for whom you are opting out as their agent. You and any persons for whom you are opting out as an agent on their behalf must sign the opt-out notice for it be effective.

The required opt out must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of either the Website, the related Services and Materials or the Background Information Services, or if you are already a user of the Website, the related Services and Materials or the Background Information Services upon initial posting of this arbitration provision, within thirty (30) days of the posting of this arbitration provision. Any opt-out not received within the applicable thirty (30) day period set forth above will not be valid. For existing users bound by a prior arbitration provision with the Company for which they did not opt out, any opt out exercised within thirty (30) days of the posting of this arbitration provision, shall only apply to this arbitration provision. Your existing arbitration provision with the Company will remain in full force and effect. Moreover, neither your acceptance of this Agreement nor your decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will affect any obligation you have to arbitrate disputes not specified in this arbitration provision pursuant to any other agreement you have with the Company.

If you opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate, you and the Company agree that any Claims will be resolved by a state or federal court located in San Diego County pursuant to Section 5. Further, if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will remain bound by the separate Class Action Waiver set forth below.

Administration of Coordinated Arbitrations

If 10 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (whether such case are pursued simultaneously or not), all the cases must be resolved in staged proceedings. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your claim. In the first stage, claimants’ counsel and the Company will each select an equal number of cases (up to the lesser of one-half of the similar claims each or 25 cases each (50 cases total)) to proceed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators. In the meantime, no other cases involving the same or similar subject matter may proceed in arbitration, and the parties will jointly request that the AAA to not assess or demand payment of fees for the remaining cases or administer or accept the remaining cases.

The arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties. After the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases, and the Company will pay the mediation fee. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve any of the remaining cases after mediation, they will repeat the process of selecting and filing up to 50 cases to be resolved individually by different arbitrators, followed by mediation.

If any cases remain after the second stage, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved, with four differences. First, a total of 100 cases may be filed in the third and later stages. Second, the cases will be randomly selected. Third, arbitrators who decided cases in the first two stages may be appointed in later stages if different arbitrators are not available. Fourth, mediation is optional at the election of counsel for the claimants.

Between stages, counsel will meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the staged proceedings, including whether to increase the number of cases filed in each stage. Either party may also negotiate with the AAA regarding the amount or timing of AAA fees.

This Section concerning Coordinated Arbitrations and each of its requirements are intended to be severable from the rest of this arbitration provision. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that the staging process in this Section is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in arbitration and the payment of AAA Fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed rather than when arbitrations are initiated.

### 4\. Class Action Waiver

Separate and apart from the agreement to arbitrate set forth above and to the maximum extent permitted by law, the parties hereby independently waive any right to bring or participate in any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative action, however denominated, in any way for any Claims against the other.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY, ITS AGENTS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND/OR ASSIGNS IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

### 5\. Forum Selection

Unless you and the Company agree otherwise, to the greatest extent permitted by law, the state and federal courts in San Diego County, California will have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes that are not subject to arbitration or actions to enforce any arbitration award (except for disputes brought in small claims court). You and the Company consent to the jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or venue in those courts, or any other basis or right to seek to transfer or change venue to another court.

Neither the Company, nor its subsidiaries and affiliates, nor any third-party data provider (for purposes of indemnification, warranties, and limitations on liability, the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its data providers are hereby collectively referred to as "Released Parties") shall be liable to you (or to any person claiming through you to whom you may have provided data that you obtained from the Company as a result of its Background Information Services), and you covenant not to sue the Released Parties, for any loss or injury arising out of or caused in whole or in part by the Released Parties' acts or omissions in procuring, compiling, collecting, interpreting, reporting, communicating, or delivering the services available in connection with the Company’s Background Information Services. In no event shall the Released Parties be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, however arising, incurred by you from receipt or use of information delivered hereunder or the unavailability thereof. Due to the nature of public record information, the public records and commercially available data sources used in the Background Information Services may contain errors. Source data is sometimes reported or entered inaccurately, processed poorly or incorrectly, and is generally not free from defect.

In addition to the above, you expressly absolve and release the Released Parties from any claim of harm resulting from a cause beyond the Released Parties’ reasonable control, including, but not limited to, failure of electronic or mechanical equipment or communication lines, telephone or other interconnect problems, computer viruses, unauthorized use or access, theft, operator errors, severe weather, earthquakes, or natural disasters, strikes, or other labor problems, wars, or governmental restrictions.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION, STATUTORY CLAIMS AND ANY AND ALL OTHER TORTS. YOU HEREBY RELEASE COMPANY FROM ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES, AND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATIONS STATED HEREIN.

IN ADDITION, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF THE RELEASED PARTIES TO YOU UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE THE GREATER OF ONE-HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH YOUR CLAIM AROSE. NO ACTION, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE THIS WEBSITE, THE MEMBERSHIP PLANS AND/OR BACKGROUND INFORMATION SERVICES OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE, MAY BE BROUGHT BY YOU MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR FOLLOWING THE EVENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION.

These Terms will take effect (or shall re-take effect) at the time you click “I ACCEPT” or “I AGREE” or otherwise acknowledge your agreement to these Terms, submit information through this Website, respond to a request for information, complete a purchase, select a method of payment, enter in payment method information, and/or begin installing, accessing, or using the Website, whichever is earliest. The Company reserves the right at any time and without notice to deny you access to the Website or to any portion thereof and to terminate your rights under these Terms, in its sole and absolute discretion. Any benefits, but not obligations, provided to you under these Terms will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with these Terms. Such termination will be effective without notice. Upon termination, you must promptly destroy all copies of any aspect of the Website in your possession. Without limitation, the provisions concerning permission to use postings, proprietary and intellectual property rights, submissions, indemnity, disclaimers of warranty, limitation of liability, access and use restrictions, audit rights, arbitration, class action waiver, release of claims, payment for Membership Plans, audit, the Company’s use and ownership of your search inquiry data, security, customer data, admissibility of these Terms, and governing law will survive the termination of these Terms for any reason.

### 33\. Waiver & Severability

Failure to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. No waiver by the Company of any right under these Terms will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision drafted and provided by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall remain enforceable and continue in effect.

### 34\. Electronic Signature

You acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to this Agreement electronically you are expressly agreeing to the terms set forth herein. You acknowledge and agree that by affixing your electronic signature you are submitting a legally binding electronic signature and entering into a legally binding contract. You acknowledge that your electronic submission constitutes your agreement and intent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Pursuant to any applicable statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or other laws, including without limitation the United States Electronic Signatures in Global Commerce Act, P.L. 106-229 (the "E-Sign Act") or other similar statutes, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED THROUGH THE PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE OPERATOR OF THE WEBSITE.

The Company may, at any time, impose restrictions and/or prohibitions on your use of the Background Information Services or certain data available through the Membership Plans.

Upon written notification by the Company of such restrictions, you agree to comply with such restrictions. Your continued use of this Website, the Services and Materials or Background Information Services following any addition, modification, or deletion will be conclusively deemed acceptance of any change to the terms and conditions of these Terms.
