Terms of Service
================

We (the folks at Gyroscope (Gyroscope Innovations, Inc.)) run an app and website platform called Gyrosco.pe and would love for you to use it. Gyroscope requires a membership to use, and we have a few membership tiers ranging from our digital offering to track, store and analyze your data, and Gyroscope Coach, which includes a human coach and advanced nutrition tracking. Almost all of our revenue comes from these paid subscriptions, which is at the core of our privacy model.

Our service is designed to give you as much control and privacy over your account as possible, while also providing powerful tools to help you live a healthier and happier life.

Your privacy is critically important to us. The entire purpose of the service is to sync and process your information. This is done on our servers, so if that is not something you feel comfortable with then you should not sign up for an account or connect your data. See the complete details of how we collect and use your personal information in our [Privacy Policy.](https://gyrosco.pe/privacy/)

### TLDR: 

This agreement has a lot of legal language and is a bit long, but how Gyroscope works is quite simple. Here are the basics you need to know:

* We do not sell your data, and rather make money from you subscribing directly.
* You own your content, but give us a right to use it.
* When you pay for a renewing subscription, it will renew until [cancelled](https://gyrosco.pe/billing/).
* You can cancel your membership or [delete your account](https://gyrosco.pe/delete/) at any time.
* Subscription payments are not refundable.
* Data in accounts without memberships will be deleted periodically.
* We can cancel your account if you act inappropriately.
* We want your feedback, and you allow us to use it.
* You agree to arbitrate if there is a dispute between us.
* Follow any suggestions or insights at your own risk — We are not your doctors and do not provide medical advice.
* By using Gyroscope, reading or listening to content, or attending any live or recorded workouts, meditations, breathwork or other activities, you agree to the [informed consent agreement](https://gyrosco.pe/waiver/) and understand associated risks.

Full Terms of Service

The Gyroscope websites, related mobile applications and services (collectively, the “Services”) are made available to you by Gyroscope Innovations, Inc., subject to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and in accordance with the Gyroscope Privacy Policy (the [“Privacy Policy”](https://gyrosco.pe/privacy/)). More information about the Services may be found at [https://gyrosco.pe](https://gyrosco.pe/). You agree to comply with these Terms and any supplemental terms which Gyroscope makes available to you on the Services which shall form part of the Terms.

BY ACCESSING, USING OR UPLOADING OR DOWNLOADING ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS TO OR FROM THE SERVICES, OR BY INDICATING YOUR ASSENT TO THESE TERMS BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT, CLICKING “SIGN UP” OR ANY SIMILAR MECHANISM, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES. This agreement was written in English. To the extent a translated version of the Terms conflict with the English version, the English version controls.

If you access or use the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent that you have authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms and that it is fully binding on them. In such case, the term “you” will refer to such entity and its affiliates. If you do not have authority, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms contain disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability that may be applicable to you.

The Gyroscope Services cannot be provided and the agreement described in these Terms of Service cannot be performed without Gyroscope processing data about you, and other Gyroscope members, including your location data. Processing of the data you share with Gyroscope, including location data, is essential to the Services which we provide and a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you.

The following terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern all use of the Gyroscope website and all content, services, and products available at or through the website, app and other platforms. Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, Gyroscope’s Privacy Policy) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Gyroscope (collectively, the “Agreement”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these Terms will apply to any upgrades.

We refer to Gyroscope Innovations, Inc. “Gyroscope” or “we” throughout this agreement.

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the Terms of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services. If these Terms are considered an offer by Gyroscope, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms.

Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (16 years or older in the European Union).

### Registration and Accounts

The Services are intended solely for persons who are 13 years old or such higher age required in your country to use the Services. If you are younger than that, do not sign up for a Gyroscope account or send us your personal data.

To use the Services, you must register for an account. You agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself (“Member Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Member Data. You agree that Gyroscope may use your Member Data to provide Services that you access or use and as otherwise set forth in these Terms. If you provide any Member Data that is inaccurate or not current, or Gyroscope has reasonable grounds to suspect that such Member Data is inaccurate or not current, Gyroscope has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse current or future use of the Services. In consideration of your use of the Services, you represent that you are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your account and for restricting access to your password, your computer and mobile device while logged into the Services. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your computer and mobile devices. We endeavor to use reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to your account. We cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your Content (as defined below) or the personal information you provide, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally accessing the Services or its contents. You agree to immediately notify Gyroscope of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other breach of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to Member Data and any other information or content you provide to Gyroscope.

You may register for or log-in to your account via a third-party network, such as Facebook. If you do so, you hereby authorize Gyroscope to pre-populate the registration and other relevant information fields of your account and/or to use such third-party credentials to log you into your account. If you connect your account to a third-party network, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such third party.

Fees, Payment, and Renewal.
---------------------------

### Fees

Some of our Services are offered for a fee — such as data syncing and storage, reports, Health Score processing, human support, custom domains, annual reports, food analysis, health coaching, and other features marketed in the app (“Paid Services”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees, which we’ll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel. You can cancel to stop renewals or change plans at any time from the billing page at gyrosco.pe/billing/ (for payments initiated on our website) or through the Apple App Store for subscriptions started in the iPhone app or through the Google Play Store for subscriptions started in the Android app.

### Payment

If you payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.

### Automatic Renewal

To ensure uninterrupted service, our Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service 24 hours before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any taxes). Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time. **Payments are not refundable.** For example, if you purchase a Gyroscope annual plan, you will be charged each year. Subscriptions can be cancelled prior to their renewal at any time at https://gyrosco.pe/billing/

### Refunds

Subscriptions must be cancelled prior to renewal to prevent charges. Refunds for previous payments will not be granted. The payment systems is designed to be 100% automated and self-managed in order to provide the lowest costs possible. Some services charge very high margins and then expect a certain number of refunds, but at Gyroscope we have already lowered the price as much as possible so this type of refund policy is not included. Please do not email app support requesting refunds, as we do not have the support staff or ability to create refunds.

### Fee Changes

We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we will give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service. Typically, you will be able to keep your promotional price forever until cancelled, and price changes will only affect new memberships.

Cancellation
------------

If you signed up on the Gyrosco.pe website, you may cancel your membership by visiting the “Billing” page and selecting “Cancel”. You can also navigate directly to https://gyrosco.pe/cancel/ to cancel the membership.

If you signed up through the Google Play or iTunes store, you may cancel your Premium membership by downgrading through the corresponding store. Those memberships are not viewable on the Gyroscope website or processed by us. The cancellation of a membership will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle. When your Premium membership ends, your account will remain and become a free membership.

A premium account is required to store and sync data, so after a period of inactivity a free account may be emptied of its content or removed from the service.

You can renew your subscription at any time without opening a new account, although the Premium membership fees may have increased. You can delete your account at any time by going to https://gyrosco.pe/delete/ after cancelling any active subscriptions and deleting the app to prevent new syncs.

Proprietary Rights

Changes
-------

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose. 

### Termination.

Gyroscope may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Gyroscope account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.  

Informed Consent
================

Exercise Program Informed Consent and Release Agreement
-------------------------------------------------------

Use of Gyroscope constitutes an acceptance of the liability waiver, fully detailed at https://gyrosco.pe/waiver/. Following insights, workouts, meditations or any other instructions from the app includes risks, including injury or death (though these are generally unlikely).

Gyroscope Innovations, Inc. (“Gyroscope”) is facilitating and offering one or more online exercise, meditation, breathwork, and/or other health or wellness classes (collectively, the “Exercise Program”). As a condition of my participation in the Exercise Program, I hereby voluntarily enter into this Exercise Program Informed Consent and Release Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Gyroscope.

Participation in Gyroscope by individuals under 18 years of age is strictly prohibited. I hereby represent and warrant that I am at least 18 years of age and that I am legally capable of forming a binding contract with Gyroscope.

I understand that the Exercise or Meditation Programs may be strenuous and may require me to do bodily, mental, emotional, or other physical movement that I am not familiar with in order to improve overall fitness. I know that there may be risks associated with the Exercise Program, Meditation Programs or other insights, and **I assume full responsibility for any risks, injuries or damage, known or unknown, which I might incur as a result of participating in the Exercise Program, including, but not limited to, dizziness, headaches, heart attacks, muscle strains, muscle pulls, muscle, ligament or tendon tears, broken bones, shin splints, heat prostration, injuries to back, neck, knee, leg, foot, arm, hand or other body part, or any other injury, illness or soreness, including death.**

I understand that I am responsible for monitoring my own safety, health and medical condition(s) while participating in the Exercise Program and, to the extent I deem advisable, I will consult with a physician before participating in the Exercise Program. Should any unusual or concerning symptoms occur while I am participating in the Exercise Program, I will immediately stop until such symptoms have resolved or I have sought appropriate medical consultation.

I make the representations and acknowledgements in this Agreement to Gyroscope with the full understanding that Gyroscope is relying on these representations.

### WAIVER / RELEASE OF LIABILITY

In consideration for being allowed to participate in the Exercise Program, which I do freely and voluntarily for my own personal benefit, I hereby take the following action for myself, my executors, administrators, heirs, next of kin, successors and assigns:

1\. I hereby voluntarily release, waive, discharge, relinquish, and covenant not to sue Gyroscope, its related companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, directors, officers, employees, agents and/or representatives, contractors or instructors (collectively, the “Releasees”) for any and all claims, causes of action, or liability for my personal injury, sickness and/or disease, property damage or wrongful death, caused by the negligence of the Releasees or otherwise, relating to or arising out of the Exercise Program or my participation in the Exercise Program.

2\. I hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Releasees from any and all liabilities or claims made by third parties (including individuals or entities) resulting or arising from my acts or omissions during or relating to my participation in the Exercise Program.

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be adjudicated in the state and federal courts of Delaware. If any provision of this Agreement is declared illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction (or other applicable governing body or agency) and cannot be modified to be enforceable (with such modification as shall be necessary to make it enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under law), such provision shall immediately become null and void leaving the remainder of this Agreement in full force and effect. The failure by Gyroscope to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. A signed copy (including via electronic signature) of this Agreement or acceptance of the terms of this Agreement transmitted by email or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original executed copy of this Agreement for all purposes.
