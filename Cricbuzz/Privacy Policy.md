2. #### Information We Collect

    **Automatically Collected Information**
    
    Most of the data we collect in and through the Site, App and the Services is technical in nature and is collected and processed automatically through so-called application programming interfaces, software development kits, cookies and similar software-based technologies. Alone or in combination with other data, such automatically collected data may constitute Personal Information. The data we may collect by automated means may include, without limitation:
    
    * Device Data and other Technical Information: including, but not limited to, data and information about your hardware, operating system, browser type, browser settings, your mobile carrier, or internet service provider, and unique ID’s and identifiers associated with your device, including IP address, and location data.
    * Usage and Viewing Data: including, but not limited to, videos and programming viewed or streamed, webpages, apps and ads you see and interact with, search terms entered, mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling, and pages viewed.
    * Network and Internet Information: including, but not limited to, URLs, Internet Protocol addresses, bounce rates, use of spoofing, active (TCP/IP) ports, number of sessions initiated, click streams, location information and network/Wi-Fi access points.
    * Information we collect on the use of the Site via cookies: please see the “How We Use Cookies and Other Technologies” section below for more information.
    
    We may use, depending on the Services, (i) location based on the IP address presented by you and (ii) network-based geo-location data based on proximity of network towers or the location of Wi-Fi networks. Please note that disabling location service will not anonymize data already collected and uploaded to our servers.
    
    **Analytics**
    
    The Services may use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect and process data about your use of the Services, including when you visit the Website, URLs of the websites that you visit prior to visiting the Services and when you visit those websites, and IP addresses assigned to the devices from where you access the Internet. Our analytics providers may set and read cookies to collect this data and your web browser will automatically send data collected by those cookies to our analytics providers. Our analytics providers use this data to provide us with reports that we will use to improve the Services’ structure and content.
    
    For more information on how Google uses this data, visit Google’s Privacy Policy and Google’s page on How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps. To prevent this data from being used by Google Analytics, follow the instructions to download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for each browser you use. Using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on will not prevent us from using other analytics tools and will not prevent data from being sent to the Services itself or to Google. For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies to measure user interactions on websites, visit Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites. You may disable cookies as discussed below, but that may impact your use and enjoyment of the Services.
    
    **Advertising Networks, Personalized Advertising, Remarketing & Retargeting**
    
    From time to time the Services may use or participate in advertising networks and related advertising services that are managed and provided by third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors, or research firms.
    
    These services collect information about your visits to and interactions with the Services and other websites and will use that information to target advertisements for goods and services and to display those advertisements on other websites. The information collected may be associated with your personal information.
    
    Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of web browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of the website and other websites, the location of your Internet service provider, the date and time of a visit to a website, and other interactions between you and a website.
    
    We use Google Analytics and Campaign Manager advertising features on our Services, which we use for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. Through Google Analytics and Campaign Manager, Google uses your Internet searches, cookies, and similar identifiers (e.g., pixel tags) to collect information about your visits to the Services and your interaction with our products and services to generate targeted advertisements to you on other websites that you visit across the Internet.
    
    To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google, to customize your ad preferences, or to limit Google’s collection or use this information, visit Google’s Safety Center and Google’s Ad Settings and follow Google’s personalized ad opt-out instructions. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site.
    
    We may also use the advertising services and networks offered by social media platforms to deliver advertising content. Use of these services requires social media platforms to implement cookies or pixel tags to deliver ads to you while you are logged into the applicable social media platformIf you do not want social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, X, etc.) to collect information relating to you via the Services or to link information collected via the Services to your social media accounts, we suggest that you: (a) do not connect to or share information with social media platforms using the Services; (b) hide social media platform plug-ins using an ad blocker; (c) always log off completely from social media platforms before visiting the Services or other websites and delete all related cookies; and, (d) where the option is made available by a social media platform, disable the advertising services and networks operated by that platform.

    The Services may include links to third party websites and social media platforms where you will be able to post comments, stories, reviews, images, recordings or other information.

    **How We Use Cookies and Other Technologies**
    
    Some of the features on the Site and App, and the Services, require the use of “cookies” - small text files or code that are stored on your device’s hard drive, browser or device to help websites remember you and collect information about your use of the website or services. We use cookies to measure which pages are being accessed, and which features are most frequently used. This enables us to continuously improve the Site and App to meet the needs of our visitors.
    
    The following sets out how we may use different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookie settings:
    
    | Type of Cookies | Description | Managing Settings |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required cookies** | Required cookies enable you to navigate the Site and/or App and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the Site and /or App and using the Services. If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we use cookies containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Site and to process your online transactions and requests. | Because required cookies are essential to operate the Site and/or App, there is no option to opt out of these cookies. |
    | **Performance cookies** | These cookies collect information about how you use our Site and/or App, including which pages you go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. These cookies do not collect information that individually identifies you. Information is only used to improve how the Site and/or App functions and performs. From time-to-time, we may engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information relating to individuals who visit the Site and/or App. We may also utilize Flash cookies for these purposes. | To learn how to opt out of performance cookies using your browser settings, [click here](https://www.aboutcookies.org.uk/managing-cookies). To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, [click here](https://www.privacypolicyonline.com/flash-cookies/). |
    | **Functionality cookies** | Functionality cookies allow our Site and/or App to remember information you have entered or choices you make (such as your username, password, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Site and/or App after logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Site and/or App to personalize your visit. | To learn how to opt out of functionality cookies using your browser settings, [click here](https://www.aboutcookies.org.uk/managing-cookies).

    | **Targeting or advertising cookies** | From time-to-time, we may engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from individuals who visit the Site. We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Site. By way of example, as you browse the Site, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our advertising partners then enable us to present you with retargeted advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with the Site. Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. | To learn more about these and other advertising networks and their opt out instructions, [click here](https://www.aboutcookies.org.uk/managing-cookies). To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, [click here](https://www.privacypolicyonline.com/flash-cookies/). |
    
    We and our service providers may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar tracking technologies in connection with the Services and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of users, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. Our advertisement partners may use a “pixel tag” or “beacon,” which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the content was viewed.
    
    We may use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-ID” or “IDFA”) and information related to how mobile devices interact with Services. A mobile SDK is akin to the mobile app version of the pixel tag or beacon discussed above. We may use this technology, for example, to analyze how you interact with the content and ads and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.

        * Sharing with Facebook.

    If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) (collectively “CCPA” unless identified individually).
    
    Your privacy rights may include, to the extent applicable and to the extent granted under applicable law: (i) the right to know and access your Personal Information that we collected, disclosed, sold, used or shared, the categories of sources from which your Personal Information was collected, the business or commercial purpose for collection or selling your Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we shared your Personal Information, and the right to ask for a copy of your Personal Information (i.e., data portability); (ii) the right to delete your Personal Information, subject to certain legally permissible exceptions; (iii) the right to correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information; (iv) the right to non-discrimination for exercising your privacy rights; and (v) the right to appeal a refusal to act on your data rights request.
    
    **Authorized Agents**
    
    The above rights are only exercisable by you where the applicable law grants you the right being exerted and where no exception or exemption under applicable law applies. You may also have an agent (if and only as permitted under applicable law) that you authorize to act on your behalf. If you have an agent act on your behalf, we have the right to authenticate such agent’s authority to act. You must provide an authorized agent with signed written permission that authorizes the agent to submit a request on your behalf, and we may require that you verify your identity directly with us. Alternatively, an authorized agent that has been provided power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465 may submit a request on your behalf. To exercise the rights described herein (only to the extent applicable), you may submit a request to us by the methods set forth under the “Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests” section below.
    
    **Requests to Know**
    
    You have the right to request that we disclose to you what Personal Information we have collected, used, disclosed, shared, or sold about you, and why we collected, used, disclosed, shared or sold your personal information over the last twelve (12) months preceding your request. Specifically, you may request that we disclose:
    
    * The categories and/or specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you;
    * The categories of Personal Information about you we have disclosed for a business or commercial purpose;
    * The categories of sources from which we have collected Personal Information about you;
    * The business or commercial purposes for which we use the Personal Information about you;

    * The specific pieces of Personal Information collected.
    
    **Requests to Delete**
    
    You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information about you that we have collected. Upon receiving a verified request to delete Personal Information, we will do so unless otherwise required or authorized by law or an exception applies.
    
    **Requests to Correct Personal Information**

    We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information that would be considered “sensitive” under applicable law.
    
    **Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information or Targeted Advertising/DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION**
    
    We do not sell your personal data as the concept of “selling” is traditionally understood as being the exchange of something for money. However, we sell your personal data to, and share your personal data with, third parties for the purpose of cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes (e.g., targeted advertising and remarketing). Applicable U.S. state date protection laws hold such disclosures and sharing to be considered “selling” or “sharing.” Therefore, you have the right to opt out of such selling and sharing. In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have sold or shared the following categories of personal data with the following categories of third parties and for the following purposes:
    
    | Category of Personal Data Sold or Shared | Category of Third-Party Recipient | Purpose |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Identifiers | Analytics, marketing, advertising, and remarketing partners and services providers | Analytical and targeted advertising purposes (including, without limitation, cross-contextual behavioral advertising). Specifically, to target advertisements for goods and services and to display those advertisements on other websites. |
    | Internet or other electronic network activity information | Analytics, marketing, advertising, and remarketing partners and services providers | Analytical and targeted advertising purposes (including, without limitation, cross-contextual behavioral advertising). Specifically, to target advertisements for goods and services and to display those advertisements on other websites. |
    
    You have the right to opt out of the selling or sharing of your personal data as described herein. You may exercise this right to opt out by contacting us through the methods set forth below under the “**Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests**” section of the Privacy policy.
    
    We do not knowingly sell or share for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes, the personal data of anyone under the age of 16 years old. See the “Children” section of this Privacy Policy for more information.
    
    Under applicable data protection laws, you may have the right to opt-out of our “sale” or “sharing” of personal information to third parties. If you wish to opt-out of such “sales” please follow the opt-out instructions below. This is a limited opt-out that does not apply to information sold or shared prior to Cricbuzz receiving your request. Additionally, this opt-out is specific to us and does not apply to any third party activity.
    
    **Methods for Submitting Consumer Requests and Our Response to Requests**

    Only you or an authorized agent (if and only as permitted under applicable law) that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. Upon receipt of a request, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity, or if you have a registered agent act on your behalf, we have the right to authenticate such agent’s authority to act. Without limiting the foregoing, the verifiable consumer request must:
    
    * Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
    * Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
    
    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
    
    Subject to our ability to verify your identity, we will respond to your request within the timeframe required under applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Notwithstanding, we will respond to any requests to opt out as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than the timeframe required by law.
    
    The delivery of our response may take place electronically or by mail.
    
    Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
    
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a reasonable fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
    
    **Right to Data Portability**
    
    You have the right to have a copy of the Personal Information that we collected and maintain about you transferred to you or to your authorized agent.
    
    **Right to Non-Discrimination**
    
    You have the right not to be discriminated against for the exercise of your privacy rights described above. Unless permitted by applicable law, we will not:
    
    * Deny you goods or services;
    * Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
    * Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
    * Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
    
    **Right to Appeal**
    
    If we deny your request to exercise any of the data rights described above, under applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision within a reasonable period of time after your receipt of our decision.
    
    You may appeal our decision by sending an email to grievance@cricbuzz.com. Your email should include “Appeal” in the subject line. We will respond to an appeal within the timeframe required under applicable law. Our response to your appeal will inform you of decisions and actions in response to your appeal, including an explanation of the reasons for the decisions.
    
    If you have concerns about the results of your appeal, you have the right to contact your state Attorney General, or if applicable, your state’s Division of Consumer Protection.

11. #### International Transfers of Personal Information
    
    We are based in the United States. As a result, Personal Information that we collect in and through the Services and on the Site or App may be transferred to our U.S. offices. In addition, we may work with third-party service providers in the U.S. and in other countries to support our business activities. Thus, Personal Information may be transferred to, stored on servers in, and accessed from the United States and countries other than the country in which the Personal Information was initially collected. By accessing, receiving, or using the Services or by providing consent to us (where consent is required by applicable law), you specifically acknowledge and agree that information may be transferred outside of the country from which you access the Services (including, for example, to the United States, Canada, and India) and that such countries’ data protection and related laws, regulations, and rules may be different than, and may not be as protective as, those of the jurisdiction from where you access the Services. In all such instances, we use, transfer, and disclose Personal Information solely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice and in compliance with applicable laws.
    
12. #### Data Retention
    
    We keep Personal Information related to your Account for as long as reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to provide our services, to deal with possible legal claims, to comply with our business interests and/or as otherwise required by applicable laws. Thereafter, we either safely delete Personal Information about you or de-identify it. Please note that even if you request the deletion of Personal Information about you, we may be required (by law or otherwise) to retain the Personal Information and not delete it. However, once those requirements are removed, we will safely delete Personal Information about you in accordance with your request.
    
13. #### Additional Information for Canadian Residents
    
    The following section of this Privacy Policy only applies to Canadian residents. Under Canadian laws and regulations, you may have certain rights in regard to our collection of Personal Information (subject to all exemptions and exceptions, as applicable). These rights include:
    
    * The right to request access to your Personal Information;
    * The right to request corrections to your Personal Information; and
    * The right to lodge a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and/or the applicable Canadian provincial regulatory body if you consider that the collection and use of your personal information violates this Privacy Policy or applicable law.
    
    The above rights are only exercisable by you where applicable law in the jurisdiction in which you reside actually grant you the right being exerted.
    
14. #### Passwords
    
    You are the sole authorized user of your Account, and you agree not to share your password, account information or access to the Services with any other person. Each user is required to have a separate username and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any log-in, password, and Account number provided by you or given to you by us for accessing the Services. You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur through the use of or under your password or Account, even if not authorized by you. Cricbuzz has no control over the use of any user’s Account and expressly disclaims any liability derived therefrom. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your password or Account or you suspect any other breach of security, you agree to contact us immediately.
