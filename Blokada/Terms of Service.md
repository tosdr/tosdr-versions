Blokada Plus / Blokada Tunnel (VPN) is a service offered by Blocka AB (559198-8265) registered in Sweden. By using this service, you are agreeing to these terms.

The service
-----------

The service protects personal information with the use of encryption and masks user metadata by hiding the user’s IP address and replacing it with one of ours. This replacement address is shared with many other users, which not only protects each individual’s user data but also breaks the traceable chain between the user and their online activity.

To protect ourselves, our customers, and the quality of our service, we block TCP port 25 because of email spam and ports 137, 138, 139, and 445 due to a Microsoft security issue.

Access to the Service
---------------------

In order to access the service, you need to use an account ID with the Blokada app or by downloading WireGuard® configuration files to another device. You can create a new account ID and download configuration files at [app.blokada.org](http://app.blokada.org/).

The cost for the service is €5 per month, it is valid for up to 5 active device at a time. You can see how much time there is left for the current subscription period on the account management screen in the Blokada app or by visiting [app.blokada.org](http://app.blokada.org/). Please be sure to write down your account ID in a safe place.

Payment
-------

We accept payment by credit card, PayPal and Stellar. One month is equal to €5. The service is activated as soon as the payment is credited, these terms will expire at the end of the period purchased.

You may choose to subscribe by credit card. With a subscription, €5 is automatically charged each month in advance. You may cancel the subscription at any time through the Blokada app or [app.blokada.org](http://app.blokada.org/). When cancelled, no more payments will be charged and the account will be valid until the current period ends. Subscriptions must be cancelled at least one day before account expiration.

Refund policy
-------------

We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee which means that you have the right to withdraw from these terms if you are not satisfied with our service. If you wish to exercise your right to a refund, please email [hello@blokada.org](mailto:hello@blokada.org) with the last four digits of your credit or debit card or relevant transaction id, the expiry date of the card and also the date at which you made the payment.

### Exceptions

We do not offer refunds for cash payments due to anti-money laundering regulations.  
Payments made in the App Store are entirely subject to Apple’s terms and conditions for refunds.

Privacy
-------

We strongly believe in having minimal data retention because we want you to remain anonymous. However, in some situations we might process your personal data to enable payments by credit card and when handling support cases initiated by the user. In those cases the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other data protection laws may apply to the processing. For more information, please read our [Privacy Policy](https://community.blokada.org/t/privacy-policy/6).

Disclaimers
-----------

Blocka AB reserves the right to modify the Service by updating the software or making changes to certain features. We will attempt to prevent interruptions and defects in the service, on the Blokada app and on [app.blokada.org](http://app.blokada.org/). Despite our best efforts, the service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, and Blocka AB does not guarantee that the service will be available at all times, the accuracy of the service or any other material provided by the service or on the Blokada app and [app.blokada.org](http://app.blokada.org/). You are solely responsible for your use of the service.

Limitations of Liability
------------------------

Blokada AB cannot be held responsible for any loss of service due to external damages or interruptions. Blokada AB is not responsible for data leakage as a result of user behavior or due to 3rd party apps installed on a device.

Applicable law and venue
------------------------

The terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with the terms shall be handled by the National Board for Consumer Disputes (ARN) or the Swedish courts, with the city of Gothenburg’s district court as the court of first instance.
