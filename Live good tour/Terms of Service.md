Section 3 Compensation



LiveGood Customers, Members, or Affiliates may participate in our compensation program as

outlined on the Pay Plan page of the website.



Commissions are paid as outlined on the Pay Plan page of the website. All Customers, Members, or

Affiliates understand BEFORE become joining or purchasing any product that there are NO

GUARANTEED EARNINGS. Customers, Members, or Affiliates understand that any and all content

on the website is not to reflect earnings, but to be used only for demonstration purposes and as a

representation of company growth and does not mean anything in terms of commissions.



Customers, Members, or Affiliates should not participate in LiveGood under the expectation of

earning income without referring new Customers, Members, or Affiliates and Customers. Neither

LiveGood, nor its Customers, Members, or Affiliates can guarantee "spillover" or earnings simply by

becoming a Customer, Member, or Affiliate. LiveGood Customers, Members, or Affiliates should not

participate in LiveGood opportunity if they are not planning on sharing the products with others.



Most Customers, Members, or Affiliates earn less money each month in the compensation program

than they are paying for their products. Although it is possible, LiveGood Customers, Members, or

Affiliates should NOT expect to make a profit simply by becoming a Customer, Member, or Affiliate

as it is very possible that will not occur.



LiveGood cannot guarantee that Customers, Members, or Affiliates earn a profit by implementing the

training materials provided. The products are for educational purposes only.



No Customer, Member, or Affiliate should spend money that they cannot afford to lose to purchase

products, advertising materials, or anything else related to LiveGood. It is possible that you will NOT

earn any income as a Customer, Member, or Affiliate of LiveGood.



A. Earnings. Commissions are paid to Customers, Members, or Affiliates who qualify pursuant

to the Compensation Plan and who are in compliance with the Contract. A Customer, Member, or

Affiliate’s success is only achieved through the regular and repeated purchase of products and the

regular and repeated product sales by its Downline Organization. As the success of any Customer,

Member, or Affiliate depends largely on the personal efforts of that Customer, Member, or Affiliate,

the Company does not guarantee any level of profit or success, nor does it guarantee a Customer,

Member, or Affiliate a specific income. A Customer, Member, or Affiliate does not receive

compensation for sponsoring or recruiting other Customers, Members, or Affiliates. The only way to

earn Commissions is through the sale of Products.



B. Payment. The Company will pay Commissions to qualified Affiliates on Product orders and

Memberships which:

(i) are received by the Company before the end of the Commission period, and (ii) have been fully

paid with appropriate payment.



1\. Commissions are paid in the name of the Person or Business Entity listed in Payment Option

link on the My Earnings section of the website. When no payment option is selected,

commissions will be held until selected.

C. Commission Payments. In the event that a Commission payment does not arrive to an

Affiliate and has been returned to the company, the company will resend the commission at no

additional charge.



D. Minimum Payment Amount. Affiliates will select how they choose to get paid on the Payment

Options page of the website. The minimum amount for payment of commission payments is ten

dollars ($10 USD). Commissions less than the minimum for a pay period will accumulate until they

equal or exceed the minimum payment amount.



E. Returned or Unpaid Payments. The Company makes every effort to ensure that an Affiliate

receives its commission payments. However, if a commission payment is unpaid due to insufficient

information or other reasons beyond the control of the Company, the payment will be held for the

benefit of the Customer, Member, or Affiliate for 90 days. After such 90 days, a monthly

maintenance charge of ten dollars ($10 USD or equivalent local currency) will be deducted from the

Affiliate’s payment.



F. No Manipulation. Manipulation of the Compensation Plan is not permitted and may result in

disciplinary action. Manipulation of the Compensation Plan includes, but is not limited to, an Affiliate

purchasing, to qualify for various Ranks or Commissions, large quantities of Product that are not

sold through the direct marketing channel, placing orders in his/her Downline Organization, and any

other actions that may violate state, federal or foreign anti-pyramid scheme laws. Such

manipulations may, in the discretion of the Company, result in the suspension of Commissions and

termination of the Affiliate.



G. Deductions and Offsets. Affiliates authorize the Company to deduct fees from its

Commissions as outlined on the Payment Option page and/or as deemed appropriate at the sole

discretion of the Company.



Section 4 Ordering Company Products



A. Inventory. As the Company imposes no specific minimum inventory requirement on its Customers,

Members, or Affiliates, a Customer, Member, or Affiliate must use its own judgment to determine

the amount of inventory it will need to sustain its projected personal use.



B. Ordering. Products can be ordered by Internet. Unless otherwise arranged, all membership

payments and product purchases will be done from the company website.



C. Back Orders. If the Company is temporarily out of stock on ordered Product, a Customer,

Member, or Affiliate will receive a “back order” notice with his or her shipment. Back orders are

filled first as new inventory arrives. Volume on back orders is credited to the month in which

payment for the original order was received by the Company.



D. Autoship Program .

1\. A Customer, Member, or Affiliate may choose to participate in the Autoship Program if available on

the website. When instituting Autoship program at the time of enrollment, the Customer, Member, or

Affiliate Agreement serves as confirmation for the setup. An Autoship account will be charged at a

set time during the month, and the Product will be shipped at a set time thereafter. The Customer,

Member, or Affiliate may obtain tracking numbers from the Company after the Product is shipped for

countries where tracking numbers are available. The scheduled dates for Autoship processing,

account charges, shipping or account changes may be selected in the Autoship section of the Order

Product page on the website.



4. There is no limit as to how many Autoship orders a Customer, Member, or Affiliate may have

set up or how many bottles of product are included in each Autoship order. All Autoship orders will

be shipped to the Shipping Address in the Personal Info section of the website. If an Autoship order

fails for billing reasons, the company will attempt to bill the payment method on file for each of the

next 10 days until the order goes through.



5. To change or terminate one’s Autoship order, the Customer, Member, or Affiliate may either

select it on their Autoship page of the Product Order section of the website, or contact customer

support. Autoship orders may be cancelled at any time prior to the order being billed.



H. Sales Tax, GST, VAT.

1. Sales tax is collected on the Product’s suggested retail price and is calculated using

the applicable rates for the location to where the product is shipped. The Company will

collect and remit sales tax to the proper taxing authority. In those jurisdictions where a

Customer, Member, or Affiliate may and has registered as a withholding agent through a

local sales tax agency and submitted a “Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate” or

equivalent document to the Company, the collection of sales tax will be the responsibility

of the Customer, Member, or Affiliate. It is the responsibility of the Customer, Member, or

Affiliate to provide an updated copy of its certification for exemption from sales tax each year.



2. In all other jurisdictions, GST, VAT, or other applicable transaction tax is based on the

purchase price. The Company will provide its GST or VAT number and proper invoicing,

which may include electronic invoicing, where permitted by law. The Company does not

include GST or VAT in commission payments. Customers, Members, or Affiliates who are

GST or VAT registered and are required to collect and remit GST or VAT on their services

may send a valid GST or VAT invoice to the Company to charge them for GST or VAT on

commission income.



I. Returns, Refunds, and Exchanges. The Company will refund the purchase price of Product or

exchange it pursuant to the following.



1. If the Customer, Member, or Affiliate (and/or his or her Customer who ordered directly

from the Company) is not completely satisfied with the First Product Purchase, he or she

may send to the Company the unused portion of the First Product Purchase within thirty (30)

days of the original purchase date and the Company will refund 100% of the purchase price

(less shipping and handling). If the First Product Purchase is returned after the thirty (30) day

period, no refund will be given.



2. Any Commissions paid to the Customer, Member, or Affiliate and his or her Upline for

the Product returned by the Customer, Member, or Affiliate or Customer will be deducted

from the respective Upline Customers, Members, or Affiliates’ accounts or withheld from

present or future Commission payments. A Customer, Member, or Affiliate agrees that he or

she will not rely on existing Downline Organization Volume at the close of a Commissions

period, as returns may cause changes to his or her Title, Rank and/or Commissions payout.



3. All shipping or courier costs for the return of Product will be borne solely by the

Customer, Member, or Affiliate unless otherwise prohibited by law. Any damage or loss that

occurs to returned Product during shipping will be the responsibility of the Customer,

Member, or

Affiliate.



4. The Company will exchange Product if the Product is damaged in shipment,

incorrectly sent due to a Company error, or of substandard quality. However, when an

exchange is not feasible, the Company will refund the amount of the returned Product. If

Product is damaged or defective, a Customer, Member, or Affiliate should contact the

Company within ten (10) days of receipt of the order.

A. Use of Sales Tools. A Customer, Member, or Affiliate may use only Sales Tools approved by the

Company for an Authorized Country. The Customer, Member, or Affiliate agrees that if it uses a

fulfillment house or other third party to sell or distribute Sales Tools, the Customer, Member, or

Affiliate will enter into a non-disclosure agreement (to be provided by the Company) with the

fulfillment house or third party to ensure that all Customer, Member, or Affiliate and Customer

information is protected from disclosure and remains the sole property of the Company.



B. Approval of Sales Tools. A Customer, Member, or Affiliate must submit all Sales Tools to the

Company for approval prior to use. The Company has complete discretion whether to approve or

reject a proposed Sales Tool. The approval process generally requires a minimum of three (3)

weeks to complete. To comply with changing laws and regulations, the Company may rescind its

prior approval of a Sales Tool, and may require the Customer, Member, or Affiliate to remove from

the market at its own cost and obligation a previously approved Sales Tool. If approved, the

Company will issue an email to the Customer, Member, or Affiliate confirming approval of said

be done on a Company Licensed Website and the advertising and selling price of all Products on

such website (i) if sold to an Applicant, must not be lower than the Customer, Member, or Affiliate

price of the Products plus reasonable shipping and the amount the Company charges for taxes,

handling. In connection with this Section, the Customer, Member, or Affiliate also agrees that all

advertising regarding the price of Products will be truthful and will not contain misleading

statements (e.g. "lowest price available" which infers that a Customer, Member, or Affiliate is able

to sell the Products at a price lower than other Customers, Members, or Affiliates, etc.). Customer,

Member, or Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that he or she shall not advertise or sell any

Products on the Internet which were purchased from another Customer, Member, or Affiliate. Any

violation of this Section by a Customer, Member, or Affiliate shall constitute a breach of the

Contract and will be subject to termination of Customers, Members, or Affiliateship.



M. Mass Communications. For purposes of this Section, “Mass Communications” are defined as

communications intended to reach twenty (20) or more Customers, Members, or Affiliates in the

sender’s Downline Organization or at least three Customers, Members, or Affiliates who are

crossline, within a seven (7) day period. The following rules apply to all Mass Communications

issued by a Customer, Member, or Affiliate:



1. Customers, Members, or Affiliates targeted to receive the Mass Communications must

have knowingly “opted in” to hear or receive the Mass Communication



a. through registration (if the Mass Communication will be received at an event or

webinar); and/or



b. through an affirmative request if the Mass Communication is delivered through an

email or on a website.



2. If by e-mail, there must be an “opt out” feature prominently displayed in the Mass

Communication.



3. The Mass Communication must comply with the terms of this Section.



4. The following disclaimer shall be prominently positioned in all Mass Communications that

promote any particular building method:



There are many methods and techniques used successfully for building your LiveGood

business. The building method promoted [in/at] this [website/webinar/email/ meeting/] may

be different from that which is taught by your upline. Please consult with your upline if they

have taught you a different building method or if you have any questions.



5. Customer, Member, or Affiliate acknowledges that allowing the Customer, Member, or

Affiliate to create databases of Customer, Member, or Affiliate information for Mass

Communications, the sale of tools, and for any other purposes constitutes the use of

Company Confidential Information, which information is the Company’s trade secrets, and

such use can be a substantial financial benefit to the Customer, Member, or Affiliate.

Customer, Member, or Affiliate acknowledges that he or she is subject to the CrossCompany

Recruiting obligations set forth in this agreement and shall survive the termination of the

Contract.



N. Lead Distribution. Persons who are outside the Company network often make inquiries to the

Company about its Products. If the Company is able to determine that the inquiring Person

received the information from a specific Customer, Member, or Affiliate or that there is a particular

Customer, Member, or Affiliate that the Person is acquainted with, every attempt will be made to

refer the Person to that Customer, Member, or Affiliate. If an association with a particular

Customer, Member, or Affiliate cannot be determined, final judgment with respect to the

positioning of leads remains the right of the Company.

O. Public Relations Matters. The Company encourages Customers, Members, or Affiliates to use

personal media coverage to expand and build their business; however, certain situations require

the Customer, Member, or Affiliate to contact the Company. These would include:



1. instances where the story or medium has national potential;



2. cases where the story calls for a wider Company/Product perspective; and/or



3. when the Customer, Member, or Affiliate is questioned about Company sales figures

and/or business strategies.



P. Retail or Service Establishments: A Customer, Member, or Affiliate may sell Products or promote

the business opportunity through Retail or Service Establishments as long as i) The display of

Independent Customer, Member, or Affiliate information within the premises of a Retail or Service

Establishment is clearly indicated, and ii) the product is not sold for an amount less than the

Customer, Member, or Affiliate price of the product as shown on the website.



Section 6 Breach of Contract Procedures



A. Conditional Obligations. The Company’s obligations to a Customer, Member, or Affiliate are

conditioned upon the Customer, Member, or Affiliate’s faithful performance of the terms and

conditions of the Contract. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if a Customer,

Member, or Affiliate is in breach of the Contract and may elect any or all available remedies.



B. Remedies. In the event of breach, the Company may elect to take no action or to exercise some

or all contractual remedies and remedies at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:



1. Notify the Customer, Member, or Affiliate either in writing or verbally of the breach and

providing a notice to cure the breach;



2. Require from the Customer, Member, or Affiliate additional assurances of future

compliance;



3. Withhold or deny recognition and attendant perks;



4. Assess damages and withhold them from commission payments;



5. Suspend Customer, Member, or Affiliate Rights temporarily or permanently;



6. Seek injunctive relief;



7. Terminate the Contract; and



8. Seek damages and associated costs.



C. Reporting Contract Breaches. If a Customer, Member, or Affiliate observes or is aware of another

Customer, Member, or Affiliate’s violation of any term or condition of the Contract, the observing

Customer, Member, or Affiliate shall submit a written complaint to the Company’s support department

through email. Because of the difficulties of investigating and asserting appropriate remedies for

stale claims, any complaint for breach of the terms and conditions of the Contract other than Cross-

Company Recruiting must be brought to the Company’s attention for review within eighteen (18)

months of the start of the alleged violation; Cross-Company Recruiting violations must be brought to

the Company’s attention within six (6) months of the alleged violation. Failure to report a violation

within that time period may result in the Company not pursuing the allegations in order to prevent the

Customer, Member, or Affiliate Business from being disrupted due to stale claims.

However, this policy does not waive the Company’s right to investigate and discipline Customers,

Members, or Affiliates found guilty of the stale claims.



D. Circumvention of the Contract. The Contract is designed to protect Customers, Members, or

Affiliates and the Company from the adverse consequences of their violation. Customers,

Members, or Affiliates who intentionally circumvent the Contract to accomplish indirectly what is

prohibited directly will be disciplined as if the applicable policy or rule had been broken directly. In

such circumstances, all of the available remedies as stated above will be available to the

Company. The Contract is not intended to give a Customer, Member, or Affiliate the right to

enforce the Contract against another Customer, Member, or Affiliate directly, or to take any legal

action against another Customer, Member, or Affiliate.
