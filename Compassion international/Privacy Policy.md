#### How We Protect and Retain Personal Information

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we will notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if legally permitted.

Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.

We retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.

#### Miscellaneous

The following additional information relates to our privacy practices:

* **Transmission of Information to Other Countries.** Your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws are less stringent than the laws in your country. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence, including, but not necessarily limited to, the Unites States. Compassion utilizes Standard Contractual Clauses as an adequacy measure for data transfers from the European Union.
* **Third Party Applications/Websites.** We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. In order to complete certain kinds of NFT transactions you may need to use third-party applications. In doing so you may be required to provide personal data to such third-party applications and in those cases, the privacy policies and terms of the third party will apply to the processing.
* **Changes to This Privacy Policy.** We may change our privacy policy and practices over time. To the extent that our Privacy Policy changes in a material way, the policy that was in place at the time that you submitted personal information to us will generally govern that information unless we receive your consent to the new privacy policy. We will note the effective date of the latest version at the beginning of the Privacy Policy.
