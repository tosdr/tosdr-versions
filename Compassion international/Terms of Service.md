#### Child Sponsorship

**Recurring Donation.**To ensure your donations are not interrupted, you must provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. If you agree to a monthly donation, your donation will be charged to the Payment Method you provided monthly until you contact us to cancel and, if selecting a Sponsorship Plan, you agree that the Payment Method on file will be charged the donation amount then in effect on a recurring basis without any further authorization from you. Your specific monthly payment date (“Billing Date”) may be determined by the day or month you sign up and will be indicated on your “Account” page. Visit the Compassion.com website and click on the “Billing details” link on the “Account”. The terms of your payment may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, debit/credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method (your “Payment Method Provider”). For some Payment Methods, the Payment Method Provider may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method Provider for details (see “Cancellation” below).

**Different Child Sponsorship Plans.** We may from time to time offer a number of different Child Sponsorship or donation plans, each with different donation amounts which will be disclosed at the time of your selection or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your sponsorships and other donations by visiting the Compassion.com website and clicking on the “Account” link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.

**Additional donations.** We may offer a number of alternative donation opportunities from time to time, including one-time donations and recurring donations. These may be restricted or unrestricted. Details will be disclosed at the time of your selection or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding the additional donations you have committed to by visiting the Compassion.com website and clicking on the “Account” link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.

**Updating your Payment Methods.** You can update your Payment Methods by going to the “Account” page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by or with authorization from your Payment Method Provider. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).

**Cancellation.** You can cancel your recurring donations to Compassion at any time, this includes your Child Sponsorship plan. Donations are not, however generally refundable. To cancel, please provide at least 3 working days before your Billing Date to avoid any future charges by visiting My Account or calling 800–336–7676.

**Changes to the amount of Child Sponsorship plans.** While we work hard to keep the cost of our programs low, there are rare times where we may need to increase the rate of our Child Sponsorship plans. This is generally due to inflation increasing the cost of providing care to the children we support. While we know that most supporters recognize this challenge and support these rate rises, we also understand that some of our sponsors are already giving at their maximum, and we appreciate that! If we need to take this step in future, unless stated otherwise in a particular communication, we will provide you at least 30 days notice and provide you an opportunity to opt out of the increase.

#### Child and Youth Protection and Appropriate Conduct Standards

As a child and youth focused organization, Compassion cares about the treatment of all children and youth. As such, it is expected that all supporters must comply with Compassion’s Child and Youth Safeguarding standards (as outlined below) and any periodic updates made to them. Failure to comply with these standards may result in immediate suspension and possible termination of a sponsorship or other engagement.

##### General Commitments

These are the behavioral expectations that Compassion expects regarding the treatment of all children and youth, regardless of their affiliation with programming or status as a participant.

* Demonstrate respect for all children and youth and not engage in behaviors or use language (including in the form of suggestions or advice), that is verbally, emotionally or spiritually abusive, sexually suggestive, degrading, humiliating, belittling, shaming, coercive, harmful or is otherwise culturally inappropriate.
* Recognize that a supporter is accountable for their response to a child or youth’s behavior, even when a child or youth initiates inappropriate behavior.
* Recognize that it is never appropriate for an adult to engage in a romantic relationship, marriage or sexual/sexually suggestive behavior (including in-person and digital/virtual interactions) with anyone under age 18, even if it is legal according to local law.
* Never condone or participate in illegal, unsafe, coercive or abusive behavior of any child or youth, including physical or sexual assault, emotional abuse, in-person or online exploitation, trafficking, harmful traditional practices, and spiritual or ritualistic abuse.
* Never hire or compel a child to engage in any form of work that is mentally, physically, socially, or morally dangerous and harmful to children or youth, or that interferes with their education. Ensure any employment of a child or youth, supports his or her development and complies with all local laws regarding the employment of minors.

##### Commitments relating to participants, former participants, and their families

These are the behavioral expectations that Compassion expects from supporters regarding the treatment of all participants, former participants, and their families.

* Always uphold the trust and confidence placed in you as a child and youth advocate to protect children and youth and serve their best interests. Conduct yourself in a way that safeguards participants from all forms of abuse, neglect and exploitation.
* Never share or publish personal or private information about a participant, former participant, or their family without the person’s permission, unless when done in compliance with required child protection related reporting or as mandated by law. The principle of keeping participant information confidential applies even if a supporter no longer has any affiliation with the participant, child and youth development center, Compassion International, and/or International Partner.
* Recognize that in some circumstances, particularly those related to inappropriate physical or digital behavior, a breach of these Child and Youth Protection and Appropriate Conduct standards may also be a breach of law and therefore subject a sponsor or donor to serious legal consequences.
* Ensure all written and digital communications with participants is healthy and respectful, following all Compassion guidelines about written and digital communication with participants.
* For the best interest of all parties, only communicate with a participant through Compassion’s established communication processes.
* Never visit a participant or their caregiver(s) independent from Compassion or otherwise outside the bounds of what has been arranged on a Compassion trip or visit.

##### Protection and Safeguarding Commitments when participating in trips, visits or other programmatic engagements:

In addition to the behaviors outlined above, these are the expectations for behaviors in the context of participating in programming, trips, or visits at the child and youth development center and/or with program participants, regardless of age.

* Always uphold the trust and confidence placed in you as a child and youth advocate to protect children and youth and serve their best interests. Conduct yourself in a way that safeguards participants from all forms of abuse, neglect and exploitation.
* Treat all participants with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender, age, race, religion, social background, culture, special needs or disability. Contribute to creating an environment where children or youth are respected and encouraged to discuss their concerns and rights.
* Only engage in activities and relationships with participants that are in line with biblical principles, and appropriate to their age and developmental abilities.
* Understand that sponsorship and other forms of monetary support may create a dynamic of power and authority that can affect participants and their caregivers. Avoid situations where these dynamics could be abused for personal advantage.
* If made aware of any actual or potential abuse, neglect or exploitation of participants, immediately follow Compassion’s process for raising concerns and respect the privacy of everyone involved.
* Engage in program-related activities with participants only in open or visible places. In the event that an activity needs to take place in an enclosed space, follow the “two adult rule,” and ensure that at least one other approved adult is present.
* Submit to the lawfully permitted background or police checks as requested prior to any real-time (in-person or digital) contact with participants or access to their personal information.
* Seek guidance about what is locally appropriate when taking photos or videos. Always follow Compassion and church dignity standards and will respect the wishes of people captured in the photograph or video.
* Respect that participants’ and their communities may have different expectations and cultural values around appearance, language, expressions of affection and other actions and ensure that my behavior demonstrates that respect. Follow any recommendations provided by Compassion.
* Respect that everyone’s personal boundaries and comfort with appropriate physical affection is different. Avoid any kind of physical contact with participants, their families or others unless they are comfortable.
* Do not use any kind of violence, physical discipline or physical punishment with participants or program staff.
* Do not travel alone with a participant except in an emergency where circumstances require immediate movement to protect against serious physical injury or death. If a life-threatening emergency occurs, make all possible efforts to continue implementing child safeguards.
* Comply with the specific obligations and expectations Compassion provides for each specific trip or visit.

##### Suspension and Termination

Where a sponsor or supporter breaches the Child and Youth Protection and Appropriate Conduct Standards, Compassion may elect to suspend or terminate a sponsorship.

In addition, any person listed on a sex offender registry and/or who has been convicted of a sex crime, or living at the same address as such a person is ineligible to be a sponsor or donor. Compassion will terminate the sponsorship or donation account of any person found on a sex offender registry and/or who has been convicted of a sex crime. Compassion will also terminate the sponsorship or donation account of any persons living at the same address as a registered and/or convicted sex offender.
