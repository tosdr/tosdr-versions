_Last Updated:_ September 12, 2023

**1\. INTRODUCTION**

Welcome to the Internet websites of Common Sense Media, including [https://www.commonsensemedia.org](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/), [www.commonsense.org/education](http://www.commonsense.org/education), and commonsense.org (together with any materials and services available on the sites, including paid access to certain premium features or content (the “**Member Services**”); collectively, the “**Site**”), which have been developed and are controlled and maintained by Common Sense Media (“**CSM**”). Please note that while the Site is owned and operated by CSM, the services provided on the Site may be performed by entities affiliated with or under contract to CSM. CSM and any and all such affiliated or contracted entities are collectively referred to herein as “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”.

**PLEASE READ THESE GENERAL TERMS OF USE (“Terms of Use”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE. These Terms of Use apply to you if (a) you are user of the Site over the age of 18 (or, if not 18, the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction) or (b) you are a parent or guardian entering into these Terms of Use on behalf of a child under the age of 13 who will be a user of the Site. By using this Site or by clicking a box that states that you accept or agree to these terms, you (i) signify your agreement to these Terms of Use, and (ii) affirm that you fall into either category (a) or (b), above. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use or do not fall into category (a) or (b), above, please exit the Site immediately, as you are not authorized to use the Site. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 (or, if not 18, the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction), please navigate to the** [**Teen Terms of Use**](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/teen-terms-of-use)**, which terms will govern your use of the Site. These Terms of Use incorporate any additional terms and conditions posted by CSM through the Site, or otherwise made available to you by CSM.**

**WHAT TERMS APPLY TO EU-BASED USERS – If you are an individual (acting as a consumer) who is based in a Member State of the European Union or the UK (whether or not the UK remains an EU Member State), please note that these Terms of Use apply to you in a slightly amended form. The amendments applicable to you are outlined in the EU-specific terms contained in** [**Section 21 (Terms specific to EU-based users)**](#section-21)**.** 

**WHAT TERMS APPLY TO USE OF OUR DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP OFFERINGS BY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM?**

* **Please note that the terms that govern and condition UK-based Educational Institutions’ use of our Digital Citizenship Offerings are our** [**UK Digital Citizenship Terms of Service**](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/uk-digital-citizenship-terms-of-service) **(together with the associated** [**Data Processing Addendum**](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/featured-content/files/csm_uk_digital_citizenship_offering_data_processing_agreement.pdf)**, which covers our Processing of certain Personal Data on behalf of such Educational Institutions).**
* **If you are an educator in UK or otherwise act on behalf of a UK-based Educational Institution, please read our UK Digital Citizenship Terms of Service carefully.**
* **The application of the UK Digital Citizenship Terms of Service to UK-based Educational Institution’s use of the Digital Citizenship Offerings does not affect or limit the general application of these Terms of Use to you and your use of the Site.**

**IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO MEMBER SERVICES, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION AT CSM'S THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION FEE UNLESS YOU DECLINE TO RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIBE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8 BELOW. MEMBER SERVICES ARE PROHIBITED IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES: CUBA, IRAN, LEBANON, SYRIA, NORTH KOREA, LIBYA, SUDAN, SOMALIA, AND BY SUBSCRIBING TO MEMBER SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE NOT LOCATED IN THOSE COUNTRIES.**

**THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 17 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS OF ANY KIND.**

You acknowledge that these Terms of Use are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged. From time to time, these Terms of Use may be changed, expanded or amended, and may include the introduction of additional terms for certain Site features. Any changes to these Terms of Use may be made without notice and will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site, so please be sure to review them on a regular basis. The effective date appearing at the top of this page indicates when the latest changes were made to these Terms of Use.

If you subscribe to Member Services, CSM will also provide notice of material changes the Terms of Use to the last e-mail you provided when registering your account. If you refuse to accept the updated Terms of Use then CSM reserves its right to discontinue your use of the Member Services.

To assist you with your review of these Terms of Use, we provide at the end of most sections a short, very high-level summary of the applicable section. **These summaries are included for reference purposes only, do not constitute contractual terms and are not a substitute for reading the actual contractual terms; the summaries will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms of Use, and, in all cases, the substantive terms of these Terms of Use (and not any summary) will govern and take priority over any summary.**

Summary:     
Welcome to our Site! We are Common Sense Media. We know that Terms of Use can be very long, so we have tried to summarize the key concepts for you in summary boxes throughout these Terms of Use in non-legalese. Although these summaries are helpful, please be sure to read all terms carefully, because the language in each Section (aside from these summaries) is the legally binding language. These terms apply to you if you are over the age of 18 or are a parent or guardian entering into these terms on behalf of a child under the age of 13. If you fall into one of these categories, and if you use the Site, you are indicating that you agree with these terms. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please navigate to the Teen Terms of Use, because those terms will govern your use of the Site. We may change these terms at any time and may do so simply by posting a revised version here. You can always check if we have changed the terms by looking to the date at the top of the page. If they have been modified, you will want to take time to review what has changed. You will also want to take a close look at Section 17, which requires that legal disagreements between you and us be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in a court room before a judge and jury.

**2\. MATERIALS ON THE SITE AND RELATED RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS**

The information and materials provided through the Site, including any data, text, photographs, graphics, images, music, audio and video clips, logos, icons, software and links (collectively, the “**Materials**”) are intended to educate and inform you. The Site is owned and operated by CSM in conjunction with others pursuant to contractual arrangements, and the Materials (and any intellectual property and other rights relating thereto) are and will remain the property of CSM and its licensors and suppliers. The Materials and the selection, compilation, collection, arrangement and assembly thereof are protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark and other laws, and you acknowledge that these rights are valid and enforceable. The Materials may be used solely to the extent necessary for your authorized use of the Site, as provided in these Terms of Use or as expressly authorized in writing by CSM or, if so indicated in writing by CSM, its licensors or suppliers. Modification of the Materials or use of the Materials for any other purpose is a violation of our copyright and other proprietary rights, and is strictly prohibited. We may change the Site or delete Materials or features at any time, in any way, for any or no reason. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Site or the Materials.

CSM currently allows you to access a limited number of CSM-curated reviews of a variety of content types (including movies, books, apps, TV shows, video games, websites, music etc) via the Site (“Reviews”) free of charge in a given time period. From time-to-time, CSM may at its sole option and discretion increase or decrease the limit on the number of Reviews that may be accessed via the Site free of charge and/or may shorten or lengthen the period of time to which such limit applies. If you wish to access additional Reviews beyond the then-current limit in the relevant time period, you will need to purchase a subscription to the Member Services to do so. You agree that you will not, and will not attempt to, circumvent any such limitations on the number of Reviews that may be accessed via the Site free of charge in the given time period.

Although CSM strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, laws, regulations, data and other information change frequently and are subject to varying interpretations. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although CSM endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete. Further, the Materials should not be construed as professional advice on any subject matter, and availability or use of the Materials is not intended to create, and does not create, any professional services relationship. In certain cases, content available within a Member Service may become unavailable due to restrictions from our licensors or other legal or policy reasons. CSM will have no liability to you for any such unavailability.

The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Site (collectively the “**Trademarks**”) are the registered and unregistered trademarks of CSM, CSM’s licensors and suppliers, and others. Our Trademarks include Common Sense, Common Sense Media, Common Sense Education, and Common Sense Kids Action, and any associated logos. The Trademarks owned by CSM, whether registered or unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not CSM’s, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with CSM or in any manner that disparages CSM. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark without the express written permission of CSM, CSM’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark. Any use of the Trademarks, and all goodwill associated with such Trademarks, shall inure solely to the benefit of CSM, CSM’s licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of such Trademarks. Misuse of any Trademarks is prohibited, and CSM will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights in such Trademarks, including via civil and criminal proceedings.

Summary:     
As between you and us, we own the rights to all of the images and other materials on the Site. You may use these images and other materials in accordance with these terms, but may not make any changes to them. We try to keep the Site up-to-date, but it is possible the Site may not be fully accurate or complete or that content within a Member Service will always be available.

There is a limit on the number of Reviews you can access via the Site free of charge in a specified period. As and when it chooses to do so, CSM may change that limit and/or that time period from time-to-time. If you want to access additional Reviews beyond the relevant limit in the relevant period, you will need to purchase a subscription to the Member Services to get such additional access. You agree that you will not, and will not attempt to, circumvent any limitations on the number of Reviews that may be accessed via the Site free of charge.

The trademarks and logos on the Site belong to either us or their owners. Such trademarks and logos may not be used by you unless you receive permission to do so from the owners of such trademarks and logos.

**3\. SUBMISSION OF MATERIALS**

CSM welcomes and values your contributions to the Site in areas designated for contribution. In such areas, users may post reviews, comments and other content, so long as you adhere to CSM’s [Code of Conduct](#code-conduct), our [Community Guidelines](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/community-guidelines), these Terms of Use and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.commonsense.org/education/privacy-policy).

Please note that, because we and our designees allow users to post reviews and other information on the Site and may in the future host other types of forums on the Site (collectively, the “**Forums**”) and, therefore, redistribute materials you give to us, we require certain rights in those materials. Accordingly, by sending or transmitting to us reviews, comments, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information or other materials (collectively, “**Submissions**”), or by posting such Submissions to any area of the Site, you hereby grant to us and our designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), adapt, modify, edit, create derivative works of, perform and display (publically or otherwise), make, have made, sell, offer for sale, import, analyze and otherwise use such Submissions, alone or as part of other works, in any media now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without additional consideration to you or any third party. None of the Submissions will be subject to any obligation, whether of confidentiality, attribution or otherwise, on our part and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. You also grant CSM and its affiliates and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such Submissions, if we or they so choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights necessary to grant the licenses granted in this section, including with respect to the content in your Submissions; that the content in your Submissions is accurate, does not violate these Terms of Use and will not cause injury to any person or entity, including by violating of the rights of any such person or entity; and that you will indemnify CSM or its affiliates or sublicensees for all claims resulting from Submissions you supply. CSM takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Submissions posted by you or any third party, including if you make any of your personally identifiable information available through the Site.

Our Forums are designed to facilitate the exchange of information between users. Information, products, services and other materials available on our Forums is provided by our staff and other contributors, some of whom use anonymous screen names and are people not otherwise connected with CSM (“**Third Party Materials**”). You acknowledge that a large volume of information, including Third Party Material, is available in our Forums and that people participating in such Forums occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. We neither control, nor endorse, nor are we responsible for such messages or statements, or for any opinion, advice, information or other content or Third Party Materials made or displayed on the Site or Forums by third parties, whether such third parties are visitors to the Site, members of the CSM community or others. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinion(s) of the participants and may not reflect the opinion(s) of CSM. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in articles or postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information or Third Party Materials. Under no circumstances will we or our affiliates, suppliers or agents be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on such information or Third Party Materials.

We have no obligation to monitor the Site or the Forums, or any Submissions or other materials (including Third Party Materials) that you or other third parties transmit or post on the Site or the Forums. You acknowledge and agree that we and our affiliates have the right (but not the obligation) to monitor or analyze your access to or use of the Site and the Forums and the materials you transmit or post, including Submissions; to evaluate, alter or remove any such materials (including, without limitation, any Submissions or postings to a Forum) before or after they appear in a Forum; to disclose such materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party for any reason or purpose, including in order to operate the Site properly; to protect ourselves, our sponsors and our members and visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.

Summary:     
We welcome your participation on our Site! Please be sure, however, that anything you submit is in accordance with our Code of Conduct, Community Guidelines, these terms and our Privacy Policy. If you submit something, you agree that we may use it or share it for any reason, and may include your name in connection with your submission.

**8\. MAKING PURCHASES; MEMBERSHIP FEES**

**Payment.** If you wish to purchase products or services described on the Site, including Member Services, you may be asked by CSM or the third party provider of the product or service to supply certain information applicable to your purchase, including without limitation credit card and other information. You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card that you submit in connection with your purchase. You understand that any such information will be treated by CSM in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree that all information that you provide to CSM or such third party provider will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred. You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes, shipping and handling charges relating to your purchases.

**Third-Party Payment Providers.** All payments will be processed via a third-party platform. CSM accepts payment via the current payment method indicated at time of purchase, which may include credit or debit card, and any other form of payment that CSM makes available to you from time to time. You agree to abide by any relevant Terms of Service or other legal agreement whether with CSM, Apple, Stripe, Google, PayPal or another third-party platform, that governs your use of a given payment processing method.

**Membership Fees.** Subscription fees for the Member Services are recurring payments (except where identified as otherwise). The term may be monthly or annual, as described in the course of transaction. Your subscription begins upon payment of the first installment of subscription fees. The subscription renews monthly or annually as applicable upon the payment of automatically recurring subscription fees. Monthly or annual fees are charged on the same day of the month that the subscription began. (For example, if a monthly subscription began on the 29th, 30th, or 31st day of a month, then membership will renew on the last day of any month that doesn’t have that many days.)

Prices for Member Services may change at any time, and CSM does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. You agree to pay for any Member Services that you order. Your credit card or other form of payment will be charged for the price and billing period listed on the relevant Member Services offer, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations. If you purchase any automatically renewing subscriptions, you agree that CSM will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the relevant subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other similar reason and we are unable to charge you on the next billing period, CSM reserves the right to immediately revoke your access to any Member Services you have ordered until you update your payment method. If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time, CSM may cancel your subscription.

**Taxes.** If CSM is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of Member Services, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction or other appropriate time as applicable. Additionally, if required by law, you are responsible for reporting and paying certain taxes in connection with your purchase and use of Member Services. Such taxes may include duties, customs fees, or other taxes (other than income tax), along with any related penalties or interest, as applicable to your purchase.

**Cancellations and Refunds.** You can cancel your Member Services at any time by updating your plan in the Membership Details section of the Settings tab in your member account or by contacting CSM at [\[email protected\]](https://www.commonsense.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you purchase a subscription to Member Services that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription at any time before the end of the current billing period and the cancellation will take effect on the next billing period, except as otherwise communicated to you by CSM. You will retain access to the Member Services from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period, and will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period. Subscription fees paid are final and nonrefundable, unless otherwise determined by CSM. If CSM reasonably determines that a user has violated these Terms of Service, CSM may immediately terminate the subscription and the user’s access to Member Services without notice and without refund. Refund requests should be directed to [\[email protected\]](https://www.commonsense.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Important Notice With Respect to Products or Services on the Site.** Descriptions or images of, or references to, products or services on the Site do not imply CSM’s endorsement of such products or services. We make no representations as to the accuracy, validity or timeliness of such descriptions, images or references. We reserve the right, without prior notification, to change such descriptions, images or references, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to you Verification of information applicable to a purchase may be required prior to CSM’s acceptance of any order. Price and availability of any product or service are subject to change without notice. It is your responsibility to follow all laws regarding the purchase and use of any product or service.

Summary:

We may make available various products or services for purchase on our Site. Please note that we may run out of or change these products or services at any time or may choose not to sell you something. Just because we make available a product or service on our Site does not mean we endorse it and you should be sure you are allowed to use a product or service before purchasing it. You are responsible for all purchases made using your username and password. If you enter any credit card information to make a purchase, you are indicating to us that you have the right to use that credit card.

If you purchase Member Services, your subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to charge you each billing cycle. Subscription fees are subject to change, and you may cancel your subscription at any time. We may terminate your subscription if we are unable to charge the payment method we have on file for you or if we reasonably determine you are violating these Terms of Service. Subscription fees are final and nonrefundable.

**9\. CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT**

If you believe in good faith that any of the materials hosted on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice by mail or e-mail, requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send CSM a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [https://www.loc.gov/copyright](https://www.copyright.gov/) for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site must be sent in writing to our Chief Financial Officer as follows: by mail to Copyrights c/o Chief Financial Officer, Common Sense Media, 699 8th Street, Suite C150, San Francisco, 94103; or by e-mail to [\[email protected\]](https://www.commonsense.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Our Chief Financial Officer’s phone number is (415) 863-0600. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA. Please note that CSM may terminate any user who it reasonably believes to be a repeat copyright infringer.

**17\. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES; ARBITRATION**

The Site is controlled and operated by CSM from its office in San Francisco, California and is not intended to subject CSM to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than California and the United States of America. The Site is solely directed to individuals residing in the United States. Those who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. **Member Services are not available in Cuba, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, North Korea, Libya, Sudan or Somalia, and you may not, and should not attempt to, purchase Member Services if you are located in any of those countries.**.

We may limit the Site’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we so choose. These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America (including federal arbitration law) and the State of California, United States of America, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law or your location, and the parties hereby expressly exclude application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or any aspect of the relationship between you and CSM, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, **will be resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that CSM and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury**. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at [https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer\_Rules\_Web\_0.pdf](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf). The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow these Terms of Use and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms of Use, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

Summary:     
Our Site is controlled and operated from San Francisco, California, and is only directed to people who live in the United States. If you access our Site from outside of the United States, it is your responsibility to comply with all local laws. Member Services are only available in the United States, and you may not purchase Member Services if you are located outside the United States. If there is a legal disagreement between us, arbitration will be used to resolve our disagreement, rather than a court room with a judge and jury. The arbitration will be subject to the laws of the United States and the State of California.

**18\. Export Control**

The supply of good and services through the Site is subject to United States export control and economic sanctions requirements. By acquiring any such items through the Site, you represent and warrant that your acquisition comports with and your use of the item will comport with those requirements.

Summary:     
Our Site is subject to U.S. export controls and you are responsible for complying with these controls.

The terms and conditions set out in these Terms of Use will only apply to a European User if and to the extent that those terms and conditions are fair and enforceable against consumers under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which such European User is ordinarily resident.

**b) UNAMENDED SECTIONS**. If any Sections of these Terms of Use are not amended by this Section 21 (Terms specific to EU-based users), they will continue apply to European Users in accordance with their terms just as they would apply to any other person who uses the Site and agrees to these Terms of Use.

**c) DISAPPLIED SECTIONS**. The following Sections of the Terms shall not apply to European Users:

i. Paragraph 5 of Section 1 (Introduction), which relates to notice of certain arbitration-specific provisions, which are not applicable to European Users; and

ii. Section 14 (Indemnification).

**d) REVISED SECTIONS**. The Sections of these Terms of Use listed below shall be removed or revised (as applicable) in the context of European Users:

i. Two new paragraphs are added to the end of Section 8 (Making Purchases; Membership Fees) reading as follows:

**‘Cooling-off’.** When you first purchase a subscription to the Member Services, you have the right to change your mind, cancel your purchase without reason, and receive a refund from CSM, during the fourteen (14) days immediately following that purchase (your, “Cooling-off Period”). You can exercise this right by contacting CSM at [\[email protected\]](https://www.commonsense.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) during your Cooling-off Period. If you use the Member Services at all during your Cooling-off Period, we reserve the right to prorate any sum that we reimburse you to reflect such use. Once your Cooling-off Period has come to an end, if you did not exercise your right to change your mind and cancel your purchase, you will lose the right of withdrawal and refund that is described above.

**Price Changes.** As noted above, we may change the prices for Member Services from time to time. We want to make two things clear about how these price changes will occur, and how they might affect you:

* When we change the prices for Member Services, we will provide you with a notification of those changes a reasonable period in advance of their taking effect (as described below).
* Any such price changes will only take effect from the start of your next subscription period (if any) that follows the date on which such price change is notified.
* If you do not wish to accept any such price changes, you can cancel your Member Services prior to their taking effect by contacting CSM at [\[email protected\]](https://www.commonsense.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
* If you do not choose to cancel your subscription after being notified of any such price change, your continued use of the Member Services after that price change coming into effect (as described above) constitutes your acceptance of that price change.

ii. Section 11 (Disclaimer) is replaced with the following:

You expressly understand and agree that (to the extent permitted by applicable law) your use of the Site is at your own risk. The Site is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, it is not bespoke to you and has not been developed to meet your individual requirements. For this reason, it is your responsibility to ensure that the generally available facilities and functions of the Site meet your requirements – for more information on the nature of the facilities and functions of the Site, please see our ‘[About Us](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission)’ page.

iii. Section 12 (Limitation of Liability) is replaced with the following:

**Commercial loss excluded.**

Subject only to the sub-section below titled Compliance with the Law, we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, loss of business opportunity, or any other business-related loss or damage, which arises as a result, or in the course, of your use of the Site for any commercial, business or resale purposes.

**Only Foreseeable Loss Covered**.

To the extent that we may be liable to you for loss you suffer as a result of your non-commercial use of the Site, we are only responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of the Terms or our negligence up to the limit specified in sub-section below titled Cap on Liability, below.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage which you may suffer:

* that is not "foreseeable" – please see below for an explanation of what we mean by the word foreseeable here, as it has a particular ‘legal’ meaning in this context; or
* that results from your breach of these Terms of Use or negligence.

Loss or damage you may suffer will be "foreseeable" if either:

* it is obvious that it would result from our breach or negligence; or
* at the time you enter into these Terms of Use, both we and you knew it might result from our breach or negligence.

**Cap on Liability**.

Subject only to the sub-section below titled Compliance with the Law, our maximum aggregate liability to you under or in connection with the Site and these Terms of Use whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall in all circumstances be limited to one hundred US Dollars (US $100) or the equivalent amount in your local currency.

**Compliance with the Law**.

Nothing in this Section or anywhere else in the Terms of Use shall limit or exclude our liability to you for:

* our willful misconduct;
* death or personal injury resulting from our negligence;
* our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;
* our breach of any terms implied by Section 46 (Remedy for Damage to Device or to other Digital Content) of the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 or any equivalent provision of consumer-protection law implemented elsewhere in the European Union and applicable to you; or
* any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.

iv. A new Section 13(A) entitled **MEMBER SERVICES (CHANGES AND DISCONTINUATION)** shall be added, reading as follows:

**Changes to Terms of Use.** We will only make changes to the Terms of Use that we do not consider will detrimentally affect the Member Services or recipients thereof, or that we believe are required to accord with we consider to be good practice in relation to security, or legal or regulatory compliance, in relation to the Member Services.

For example, we may make edits to these Terms of Use to reflect a change to the existing functions or features of the Member Services or a new piece of law that applies to us and/or the Member Services.

**Our right to discontinue or change the Member Services.** We may discontinue or change the Member Services, or any part of them, at any time:

* for legal or regulatory reasons;
* for security reasons; and
* where applicable in respect of changes to the Member Services:
    * to enhance features of the Member Services;
    * to reflect our obligations to third parties;
    * to reflect advancements in technology;
    * to make reasonable technical adjustments to the Member Services; and/or
    * to ensure the ongoing operability of the Member Services.

We will inform you a reasonable period in advance if we wish to discontinue, or make any material changes to, the Member Services.

**Cancellation and refunds.** If we do choose to discontinue the Member Services, we will give you a prorated refund of fees paid for the Member Services. If you do not wish to accept any such changes to the Member Services notified to you, you can cancel your Member Services by updating your plan in the Membership Details section of the Settings tab in your member account or by contacting CSM at [\[email protected\]](https://www.commonsense.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) – if you choose to cancel your Member Services in these circumstances, we will give you a prorated refund of fees paid for the Member Services.

**Prevail.** A term in this Section 13(A) shall, in respect of European Users who have a Member Services subscription, prevail over any term in any other Section of these Terms of Use in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the two terms – including, without limitation:

* the final sentence of Paragraph 7 of Section 1 (Introduction);
* the final two sentences of paragraph 2 of Section 2 (Materials on the Site and Related Rights and Restrictions);
* the final sentence of Section 13 (Termination; Changes or Discontinuation of Services).

v. Section 17 (Applicable Law and Jurisdictional Issues; Arbitration) shall be replaced with the following:

Please note that these Terms of Users, and their subject matter and its formation, are governed by English law. We and you both agree that the courts of England will have nonexclusive jurisdiction in respect of any disputes arising out of in connection with these Terms of Use or their subject matter. However, if you are a resident of a country elsewhere in the European Union, nothing in this Section will prevent you from bringing proceedings against us in the jurisdiction in which you are ordinarily resident.

vi. The following sentence shall be deleted from Section 19 (Miscellaneous)

“These Terms of Use, including any terms and conditions incorporated herein, constitute the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.”
