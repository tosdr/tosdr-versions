* **Child Members:** To learn about our practices regarding children's Personal Information, please read our [Children's Privacy Policy](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/childrens-privacy-policy). When we intend to collect Children's Personal Information, we take additional steps to protect their privacy, including:
    * Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children;
    * Limiting our collection of Children's Personal Information to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and
    * Providing parents with access to, and the ability to request changes to or deletion of, Children's Personal Information that we have collected.

Please note that:

* For Adult Members and Educator Members, your first name and the first initial of your last name will be displayed next to any reviews that you post on our Services by default. Adult Members have the option to create a username in their Profile to display instead of their real name. Teen Members are identified by their username.Your username identifies you on the Services. For instance, YOUR USERNAME IS INCLUDED IN YOUR PROFILE THAT IS VIEWABLE BY OTHER MEMBERS, AND IS DISPLAYED WITH REVIEWS THAT YOU WRITE. SINCE THE USERNAME IS VIEWABLE BY OTHERS, WE SUGGEST THAT YOU NOT USE YOUR REAL NAME FOR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD, TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY.
* For Adult Members, when you publish reviews on the Services, the ages of your children are displayed on the reviews by default. You can choose to make the ages of your children private in your Profile settings.
* For Educator Members, when you publish reviews on the Services, the name and location of your worksite are displayed the reviews by default. You can choose to make your worksite information private in your Profile settings.

Once you delete your account, all of your Personal Information stored in your account and Profile on our Services will be removed and any reviews you posted will remain on the Services but the author name will switch to "anonymous" so your name will no longer be connected with your content (unless you have chosen to include your Personal Information in that content itself – in which we recommend you request that we remove all content associated with your account). If you wish to delete your reviews you may do so before you delete your account. Or, you can contact us at [Contact Support](https://commonsense.force.com/membersupport/s/contactsupport) and request that we delete your content (including reviews) and account for you.
* If you decide that you would like your posted reviews deleted from our Services, you can do this at any time by logging into your account, viewing the review or comment, and clicking the "delete" button. You can also send us an email at [Contact Support](https://commonsense.force.com/membersupport/s/contactsupport) with your username, date of submitted review or comment, and title of media type that was reviewed. Please note that your request or deletion does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE OR ON PUBLIC-FACING AREAS OF THE SERVICES.
* In addition to the Personal Information you provide to us while using our Services, we may receive Personal Information from other sources, such as Common Sense events, Common Sense education partners, activity on Common Sense social media platforms, and publicly and commercially available databases.

**B. Collection of Information by Payment Services**

Payment Data and Donation Data is processed directly by our Payment Services via payment service pages that we direct you to, or we incorporate into our Site or Apps. When processing payments and donations on our behalf, Payment Services typically act as our ‘processor’ in respect Users’ Payment Data and Donation Data – essentially, this means that they only process your Payment Data and Donation Data for this limited purpose. However, Payment Services may also have their own legal and regulatory obligations that might require them to use your Payment Data and Donation Data for their own compliance-related purposes (e.g., security and fraud prevention) – THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS PAYMENT SERVICES’ PROCESSING OF PAYMENT DATA AND DONATION DATA FOR SUCH INDEPENDENTLY-DETERMINED PURPOSES, WHICH WILL BE SUBJECT TO THAT PAYMENT SERVICE'S PRIVACY POLICY RATHER THAN THIS POLICY.

**C. Automatic data collection**

We may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your activity over time on our Services, such as:

* Device data, such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers, language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.

Some of our automatic data collection is facilitated by cookies and similar technologies. For information about our cookies and similar other technologies, what they do, and how to disable the non-necessary ones, please refer to our full [**Cookie Policy**](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/cookie-policy).

Certain information, like aggregated information or high-level location information, such as the browser language and country during the user session, is treated as non-Personal Information unless applicable law requires otherwise. We may use or disclose such information for any purpose. For instance, we may compile and share aggregate data about the geographic locations or other demographics of our Members, provided that this information does not personally identify any of these Members.

**II. OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**A. How We Use Personal Information**

* **Membership.** If you become a Member, we may use your Personal Information to maintain and update your Profile and postings in our online reviews, surveys and polls. All content that you submit to the Services is governed by our Terms of Use. We may also use Personal Information to send updates and communications to our Members, such as our e-newsletters, surveys and other important Common Sense Media communications such as information regarding the Services or changes to our terms, conditions and policies.

We will not sell or use your Personal Information for targeted advertising or for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similar significant effects.

**B. How We Use Information Collected Through Digital Citizenship Quizzes**

Quizzes provided by Common Sense Education are available at the end of each lesson in the Digital Citizenship Curriculum. Each quiz includes 4-6 questions that have varied formats: multiple choice, drag and drop to complete a sentence, and drag and drop sorting. The quiz is autograded and students can see their results immediately. The quizzes are intended to assess student understanding after the teacher has completed the corresponding lesson.

Common Sense quiz reports (for the entire class and individual student) are only accessible to a teacher who is authenticated with Google Classroom and who requests specific quiz reports on specified students authenticated with Google Classroom. Common Sense uses the data collected through Digital Citizenship Quizzes exclusively for the purpose of providing the CS Digital Curriculum services to the school districts using Common Sense's free online educational services. Common Sense works with the following third party service providers to provide Google Classroom integrated quizzes through the Digital Citizenship curriculum:

* **Learning Locker**                      
    Learning Locker is a Learning Record Store (LRS) database-driven application and analytics tool designed specifically for the learning sector. Common Sense uses Learning Locker to store, sort and share data as recorded using the xAPI specification from Google Classroom. Learning Locker may collect and store the following information including, but not limited to: Google User ID, quiz\_id, quiz name, start time, start date, quiz completion, stop time, stop date, quiz duration, quiz questions, alphanumeric answers, quiz grade, and quiz ranking. Please read Learning Locker’s [privacy policy](https://www.ht2labs.com/privacy-policy/) for more information.
* **Google Classroom**                      
    Google Classroom is a free web service developed by Google and part of the G Suite for Education to help schools streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students. Students using Google Classroom can view assignments, submit homework, and receive grades from teachers to help them stay on track and organized. The G Suite for Education core services are the heart of Google’s educational offering to schools. The core services include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts and Vault. Please read Google Classroom’s [privacy policy](https://gsuite.google.com/terms/education_privacy.html) for more information.                      
      
    The Google Classroom service provides Common Sense with a Google Classroom authenticated teacher’s class roster of student Google IDs. Only authenticated teachers can access student first and last names associated with Google IDs for quiz reporting purposes. Common Sense requests authorization from teachers to access their Google Classroom class roster of student Google IDs in order to combine all the specified student Google IDs present in the class roster with their respective Common Sense quiz submission data and quiz grades in order to generate class and individual student quiz reports for teachers. All quiz reports are generated on-demand by the Google Classroom authenticated teacher and are not stored or retained by Common Sense. When a teacher requests a "class roster" or individual “student” quiz report, Common Sense loads the teacher’s specified Google IDs from our third-party service provider Learning Locker and matches student IDs with Google Classroom to create and display a class roster quiz report for the entire class, or individual student report to produce a Google Classroom listing that includes student names paired with quiz scores. Common Sense and our third-party service providers do not store or retain any class or individual student report data.

**C. How We Use Information Collected Via Cookies and Other Technologies**

We use information collected via cookies, web beacons and other technologies as described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/cookie-policy)

**III. HOW WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SERVICES**

Except as expressly provided in this Policy, we will not share any Personal Information about you without your prior consent.

**Your Posted Reviews.** If you post reviews or ratings on our Services, the contents of those postings may be displayed on our Services along with your name (first name, and first initial of last name) or username, Member photo, Member type, age (if under 18 years of age) and school information (if you are an educator). The ages of your kids may also be displayed if you provide this information and allow it to be posted (this information can also be selected to remain private).

**Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum Training.** For Educator Members who complete our Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum Training, if requested by your school district, we may share your first and last name, school name, and completion date. The purpose of sharing this data is to help your district understand which teachers have received instruction on the Common Sense curriculum. Additionally, if your school receives E-rate support, it will help your district comply with CIPA.

**Third-Party Service Providers.** We work with third-parties who provide services such as data analysis, payment or donation processing, order fulfillment, infrastructure provision, information technology services, content personalization, email delivery services, and market research or third-parties who provide other services to help improve or operate our Services. We may share Personal Information about you with third-parties solely for the purpose of enabling them to provide these services to us. These service providers are given access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but are restricted from using the Personal Information for purposes other than providing services for us. When we engage a third-party who will need to access and process your Personal Information as part of their services, we ascertain that the third-party is capable and obligated to provide at least the same level of data privacy and protection as we hold ourselves to. Our third-parties are required to notify us if they determine they can no longer meet the expected level of data privacy and protection, and we monitor for compliance to our data protection terms based on the nature of the services being provided.

**Single Login**:If Educator Members register or login to the Services through a Single Sign-On Service, we will ask you for your permission to access your data on the Single Sign-On Service to create an account and profile. In addition, we may use this data for several purposes, including:

* Populating Account and Profile Fields: When you are connected via a Single Sign-On Service, we will pre-populate and update your account and Profile fields with data from the Single Sign-On Service that you allow us to access. You can update this information at any time on your Account and Profile pages.

We might also display lists of content for you that similar users also like.
* Aggregate Reporting: When you are connected via a Single Sign-On Service, we may use Personal Information from the Single Sign-On Service that you allow us to access to learn more about the demographic information of our users.

Educator Members may disconnect from a linked Single Sign-On Service at any time by visiting the "My Account" or "My Profile" section of the Site.

We will not share any information about you collected on the Services with a linked Single Sign-On Service without your approval. This means that we will not post anything to your Google account or similar unless you give us specific permission to do so, and we will not contact your friends or followers at any time. We do not store or utilize the names of your friends or followers even if they are passed to us by a single sign-on service in the initial registration process.

Single Sign-On Services provide varying levels of control over the extent to which content or information you submit to the Services is also made public and shared on linked Single Sign-On Services. When you use a Single Sign-On Service to log into the Services:

* You share your information with it and its privacy policy applies to the Single Sign-On Service's collection, use, and disclosure of such information.
* In addition, the Single Sign-On Service may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Services, and it may notify your connections on the Single Sign-On Service about your use of the Services.
* Such services may also employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering targeted advertising to you.

Please note that the privacy policies and terms of use of linked Single Sign-On Services may be different from our own and we encourage you to read them. We also encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy controls and account settings on linked Single Sign-On Services for information on how to customize your privacy settings with respect to content or information submitted to the Services.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to use your Personal Information, and to disclose it to others, as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under a requirement of applicable law, (b) to comply with legal process, (c) to respond to governmental requests, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service, (e) to protect our operations, (f) for assistance in fraud detection and prevention; (g) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Common Sense Media, you or others, (h) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and (i) in connection with a disposition of all or a substantial portion of our business, assets or stock, such as the sale of the Site or Services, a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, assignment, or bankruptcy or similar proceedings.

Personal Information about you may be transferred, stored, and processed by us or the third-parties we work with in countries whose data protection laws and regulations may be different to those of your country. We allow transfers of Personal Information made between countries or regions in a fashion that complies with applicable law.

**IV. DONOR PRIVACY POLICY**

At Common Sense, we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our donors. We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any Personal Information we obtain from you with care and respect.

In addition to obtaining information from you, we may supplement your information with data from public databases, including to research donors and conduct fundraising analysis, including to assess individuals’ philanthropic interests and ability to support Common Sense. We are not in the business of renting, selling, or trading our donors’ names or Personal Information, nor of sending mailings to our donors on behalf of other organizations. If this should ever change, we would only do so with your prior consent.

We may use third-party service providers to provide certain services on our behalf, including to process donations. To the extent that any third-party service provider is used to process donations, that service provider has assured Common Sense it will not use personal donor information for any purpose other than what is necessary to process the gift transaction for Common Sense. And any additional service providers, such as email providers, are given access to personal donor information only as needed to provide their functions for Common Sense.

This policy applies to all donor Personal Information received by Common Sense, both online and offline, on any Services, as well as through any electronic, written, or oral communications.

Please note: if you choose to make your donation ‘anonymously’, we will not use information relating to your donations for the purposes described, whether or not you would have been eligible based on the amount of the relevant donation.

**V. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We keep your Personal Information only for as long as it is warranted to provide our Services, fulfill our commitments to you, and/or adhere to legal or regulatory requirements. If you are a Member or a donor, we keep your Personal Information for the duration of our relationship. Certain Personal Information may be kept and archived for longer though, as required for recordkeeping purposes or backing up Services’ data for example. When Personal Information is expired, or is no longer needed and does not have to be retained, we may return, delete, destroy, or anonymize it, depending on what method is systematically and procedurally possible, most secure, and what our related retention commitments are.  

**VI. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION**

_Links_. For your convenience and information, we may provide links to websites and other third-party services and content that is not owned or operated by us. The third-party websites, services and content to which we link may have separate privacy notices or policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any entity that we do not own or control.

**What is our “legal basis” for processing your Personal Information?** In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Information (see [below](https://www.commonsense.org/education/privacy-policy#Purposes-for-Processing)), the GDPR requires us to have a "legal basis" for that use.

**Purpose limitation.** We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which we collected it as listed [above](https://www.commonsense.org/education/privacy-policy#Purposes-for-Processing), unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your Personal Information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law (including the GDPR).

**What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data or you withdraw consent?** Where we _**need**_ to process your Personal Information either to comply with law, or to perform the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you. Similarly, if we rely on your consent to process your Personal Information, you are entitled to withdraw your consent, but if you do, we may not be able to provide certain services or features to you. We will keep you informed of when your access to service or features depends on your consent.

**Our newsletters**. EEA+ Users who are Adult Members, and other EEA+ Users over the age of 18, can opt-in to receiving our newsletters. Please note, however, that you may continue to receive ‘service-related’ and other non-marketing emails from us, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or this Policy.

**How do you get consent from parents of Children when we are required to do so?** We use the term "Children" to refer to younger kids for whom collecting parental consent is required under applicable laws. For example, under Article 8 of GDPR, when Personal Information is collected under the lawful base of consent (as provided by Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR) in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a Child parental consent is required. The age range that requires parental consent varies per Member State but in no event can be higher than 16 years of age. If parental consent is required in respect of any processing of a Children’s Personal Information, that Child must provide their parent’s email address. We use that email address to contact the Child’s parent to ask for their consent to the relevant processing – we also explain to the parent:

* what Personal Information we collect about their Child;
* how we use it and why; and 
* how the parent can revoke their consent and/or ask that we delete their Child’s Profile and their Personal Information.

If at this stage, the parent gives us their consent, we will carry out the processing. If not, we won’t.

**What rights do EEA+ parents have?** If you are a parent of a Child who is an EEA+ User, and we need your consent to certain processing of your Child’s Personal Information, please contact us if you:

* believe your Child is participating in an activity on the Services that uses their Personal Information without the parental consent required by law; and/or
* no longer wish for your Child to participate as a member of the Services,

We will delete your Child’s Profile, and any parental contact information we may hold, on request. If you wish to exercise these rights, you can do so through our Privacy Requests Portal.

**Personal Information from Third Party Sources.** In addition to the Personal Information that we collect directly from you we also collect certain of your Personal Information from the following categories of third party:

* Single Sign-On providers – we may receive certain Identity Data, Contact Data, and Service Personalization Data relating to Educator Members who register for, and access the Services using, a Single Sign-On Service.
* Fundraising Tools – we derive or receive Donor Analysis Data from certain commercial- and publicly-available sources, which we use to enrich the profiles of our current and prospective donors (example of such data sources are the iWaves PROscores, CoreLogic, VeriGift, Larkspur Data databases).

**International transfers**. We are headquartered in the United States. The Personal Information that we collect from and about you will be stored and processed in the United States and may be stored and processed in other countries outside of the EEA+. However, it is our policy to ensure that adequate contractual or other safeguards are applied to Personal Information transferred outside of the EEA+ where required by the GDPR. If you have questions about the safeguards applied to your Personal Information, you may contact us at [Contact Support](https://commonsense.force.com/membersupport/s/contactsupport).

**Members:** Visitors who complete the membership registration process through our Services. Members join an active and vibrant community of families and educators interested in the impact of media on their children and students and can engage in activities not available to Non-Members, such as creating user reviews on media products, participating in surveys and polls, and saving favorites to a personal page. If you are not currently a Member, you may [click here](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/user/register) to register, or [here](https://www.commonsense.org/user/register) if you are an educator, and become eligible for our Services' features.

**Visitors:** Individuals who visit our Services but who do not complete the membership registration process.

Child or Children: Younger kids for whom collecting parental consent is required under applicable laws. For example under COPPA in the United States, children for these purposes are considered to be individuals under the age of 13. This age range may vary in other countries and regions. Where consent is required or recommended for a particular purpose or practice, we aim to get parental consent for youth in accordance with the age designated by the country they are in.

**Teen:** Older kids for whom collecting parental consent is not required under applicable laws. In the U.S. a Teen would be a kid that is 13 or older yet under 18. This age range may vary in other countries and regions, but in all cases, an individual over 18 is not considered a Teen.

**GDPR:** The EU General Data Protection Regulation and the so-called ‘UK GDPR’
