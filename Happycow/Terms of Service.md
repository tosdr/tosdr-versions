The use of HappyCow's Services is expressly conditioned upon your assent to all these terms and conditions, to the exclusion of all other terms; if these terms and conditions are, at any point, considered or characterized as an offer by HappyCow, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.

Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, and any access to or use of Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A.

#### Intellectual Property

The contents of Services are protected by U.S. and International copyright and trademark laws. The contents of the Services are owned by or licensed to HappyCow or its affiliates. In the case of User Materials (as defined in the "User Materials" section below) the contents are licensed to HappyCow by the user. You may not reproduce, distribute, republish, upload, transmit, display, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform, sell, transfer, assign, license or use for commercial purposes any copyrighted material on the Services without the prior written consent of HappyCow, except as provided below. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms of Use are reserved to HappyCow.

You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.

You may copy, or download, and print a limited amount of content, for your personal, non-commercial use only, provided that (a) you include, without modification, all copyright and other proprietary notices contained in the content, (b) you do not modify the content, (c) you do not use the content in a manner that suggests HappyCow promotes or endorses your, or any third party's, causes, ideas, websites, products or services, and (d) you do not use the content in any way that is unlawful or harmful to any other person or entity.
