--------------

1\. The materials on The StoryGraph's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. The StoryGraph makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

2\. Further, The StoryGraph does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

4\. Subscriptions
-----------------

1\. Some parts of The StoryGraph are billed on a subscription basis. If you purchase a subscription, you will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis. These billing cycles are set on a regular basis, typically monthly or yearly.

2\. At the end of each billing cycle, your subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or The StoryGraph cancels it. You may cancel your subscription renewal at any time either via your online account management page or by contacting customer support.

3\. A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide The StoryGraph or its third-party payment processor, with accurate and complete billing information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize The StoryGraph to charge all subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. All amounts paid are non-refundable. You further agree to be responsible for all taxes associated with the service, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by your financial institution and intermediaries. All amounts are in US Dollars, British Pound Sterling, or Euros.

4\. The StoryGraph may, at its sole discretion, offer a subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time. You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for a free trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for a free trial, you will not be charged by The StoryGraph until the free trial has expired. On the last day of the free trial period, unless you cancelled your subscription, you will be automatically charged any applicable subscription fees.

5\. At any time and without notice, The StoryGraph reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of the free trial offer, or cancel any free trial offer.

6\. The StoryGraph, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of your current billing cycle. The StoryGraph will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the service after the subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.

5\. Refunds
-----------

All amounts paid are non-refundable. Certain refund requests for subscriptions may be considered by The StoryGraph on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of The StoryGraph.

6\. Limitations
---------------
