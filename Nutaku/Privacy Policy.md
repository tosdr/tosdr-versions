### 7\. Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies

As you navigate through and interact with our Website, we use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including information such as your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

* **Cookies (or browser cookies)**

Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, and allow a website to recognize a user’s device.

We currently use the following types of cookies:

* * _Strictly necessary cookies_: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log in to our Website and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular service or content.
    * _Analytical cookies_: These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Website. These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily.
    * _Functionality cookies_: These cookies are not essential but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience on our Website. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you return to our Website and to remember, for example, your choice of language.
    * _Targeting cookies_: These cookies record the visit of a user on our Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed in order to enable us to make our Website more relevant to the users' interests.

Analytics, Functionality and Advertising/Targeting cookies can be switched off at any time by accessing the ‘Manage cookies’ option that is located at the footer of The Website. However, if you decline to accept these cookies, some functionality on The Website may be disabled and can interrupt your access to certain parts of The Website.

Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires, or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years.

Do Not Track: Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals.

_Flash Cookies_. Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see “**Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information**”.

* **Web Beacons:**

Pages of our Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.

* **Analytics:**

We use third party analytics and advertising tools and technologies, in particular Google Analytics and DoubleClick provided by Google, Inc., USA (“Google”). These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including IP addresses, devices, and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device identifiers, and other similar information via the use of cookies. The information generated by Google Analytics and DoubleClick about your use of this Website (including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Because we activated IP anonymization for Google Analytics and Double Click, Google will anonymize the last octet of a particular IP address. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of this Website, compiling reports on Website activity, and managing advertising content. The information collected by Google Analytics may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved by the EU and the adequacy decision of the EU Commission C (2023) 4745 confirming an adequate level of data protection in the US under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and applicable national extensions (for example the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework). You can learn more on how Google uses data [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), and you can opt-out of Google Analytics by visiting the [Google Analytics opt-out page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or by accepting only necessary cookies.

### 8\. Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on this Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website. Unless expressly stated otherwise, our website does not provide any Personal Information to these third parties, however the information they collect may be associated with your Personal Information or they may collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.

We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see “**Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information**”.

### 9\. Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us.

* You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Website.
* You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this Website may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
* You may opt out of the double-click a cookie or of Google Analytics by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?hl=en) or by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at [Google Analytics opt-out page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

* verify you are a real-life person and to prevent the use of methods which would allow a user to identify as someone else; 
* to help confirm your age

We only process biometric information in jurisdictions that require age verification to access the Websites. Such verification is processed through a trusted third party provider.

### 12\. Financial Information

Financial information (including Personal Information) that you have provided to us will only be shared with our third-party processors in order to initiate and complete any orders placed on your account. All credit card transactions and such are processed with industry standard encryption through third party processors who only use your financial information and Personal Information for that purpose. All financial data and related Personal Information will not be shared by us with third parties except with your authorization or when necessary to carry out all and any transactions requested by you with the understanding that such transactions may be subject to rules, terms, conditions, and policies of a third party. All such information provided to a third party is subject to their terms and conditions.

### 13\. Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries

Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer Personal Information to countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.

By using this Website, you consent to the transfer of information that we collect about you, including personal information, to any country in which we, members of our corporate group (that is, entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us) or our service providers are located.

### 14\. Retention of Personal Information

We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Where we no longer need to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, we will delete your Personal Information from our systems.

Where permissible, we will also delete your Personal Data upon your request. Information on how to make a deletion request can be found under “**Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information**”.

If you have questions about our data retention practices, please send us an e-mail at [support@nutaku.net](mailto:support@nutaku.net).

The period for which we keep your Personal Information that is necessary for compliance and legal enforcement purposes varies and depend on the nature of our legal obligations and claims in the individual case.

### 15\. How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural measures) to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Information.

You are responsible for always maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information. We are not responsible for circumventions of any privacy settings or security measures contained on this Website.

### 16\. Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information

Subject to local law, you have certain rights regarding the Personal Information we collect, use or disclose and that is related to you, including the right:

* to receive information on the Personal Information concerning we hold about you and how such Personal Information is used (right to access);
* to rectify inaccurate Personal Information concerning you (right to data rectification);
* to delete/erase your Personal Information (right to erasure/deletion, “right to be forgotten”);
* to receive the Personal Information provided by you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit those Personal Information to another data controller (right to data portability);
* to object to the use of your Personal Information where such use is based on our legitimate interests or on public interests (right to object);
* in some cases, to restrict our use of your Personal Information (right to restriction of processing); and
* withdraw your consent at any time where our processing is based on consent (right to withdrawal of consent).
* If you are in the EEA or the UK, you also have a right to file a complaint with your local data protection authority. 

You may exercise your right to access and deletion using the buttons at the bottom of this page. Additionally, you may, at any time, send us an e-mail at [support@nuaku.net](mailto:support@nuaku.net) to exercise your above rights in accordance with the applicable legal requirements and limitations.

Please note that unless you have created an account with us, we may not have sufficient information to identify you and therefore may not be in a position to respond to your request. Additionally, in some cases in order to adequately verify your identity or your authorization to make the request, we may require you to provide additional information.

Note that some requests to delete certain personal information will require the deletion of your user account as the provision of user accounts are inextricably linked to the processing of certain personal information (e.g., your e-mail address).
