Dear EasyChair Users,
---------------------

EasyChair is currently down due to a hardware problem. The system disk of our third-party service host is malfunctioning. We want to emphasise that **NO** data will be lost as EasyChair has multiple backups.

We are currently migrating to a new server. This will be done in **24 hours or less**, and EasyChair should be fully functional at 6pm London time, October 23rd, at the latest.

We deeply apologize for all the inconvenience caused.

Yours sincerely,

EasyChair LTD
