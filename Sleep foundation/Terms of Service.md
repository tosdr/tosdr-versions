**13\. Governing Law and Arbitration**

This Site is controlled by Sleep Doctor from its corporate offices in Seattle, Washington, United States of America. It can be accessed from all 50 states, as well as from other countries around the world. As each of these jurisdictions have laws that may differ from the laws of the State of Washington, by accessing Site both you and Sleep Doctor agree that the statutes and laws of Washington, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof, will apply to all matters relating to use of this Site.

Sleep Doctor and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us except for (i) claims seeking injunctive relief in connection with the intellectual property of Sleep Doctor, and (ii) claims for amounts less than $10,000. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

* claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
* claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
* claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
* claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Sleep Doctor are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Sleep Doctor and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Sleep Doctor may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Sleep Doctor or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Sleep Doctor is entitled.

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless Sleep Doctor and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Seattle, Washington. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND SLEEP DOCTOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Sleep Doctor agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.

If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you agree that any such disputes will be resolved through the courts located in Seattle, Washington.

**14\. General**

1. This Agreement shall be governed by Washington law and controlling United States federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, and any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Site, with the exception of claims for injunctive relief, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.
2. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provisions shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provisions, with all other provisions remaining in full force and effect.
3. It may be necessary for Sleep Doctor to perform scheduled or unscheduled repairs, maintenance, or upgrades and such activities may temporarily degrade the quality of the Site or result in a partial or complete outage of the Site. Sleep Doctor provides no assurance that you will receive advance notification of such activities or that access to the Site will be uninterrupted or error-free.
4. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Sleep Doctor as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. The failure of Sleep Doctor to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Sleep Doctor in writing.
5. If you have not entered into another agreement with Sleep Doctor regarding the subject matter contained herein, then this Agreement comprises the entire agreement between you and Sleep Doctor and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding such subject matter. However, if you and Sleep Doctor have entered into another agreement regarding the subject matter set forth herein that is a written and signed agreement between you and Sleep Doctor, then this Agreement should be read and interpreted in conjunction with such agreement and, in the event of a conflict between this Agreement and a written, signed agreement between the parties, the written, signed agreement shall govern and control.
