Copyright © Cameyo Inc., a Delaware Corporation doing business at 5000 Centre Green Way, Suite 500 in Cary, North Carolina, USA, 27513. All rights reserved.

Use of Website
--------------

You are hereby authorized by Cameyo to view, download, copy and print documents and the graphics incorporated therein (“materials”) from this website subject to the following restrictions and in accordance with any written agreement between you and Cameyo: 1) the materials may be used solely by you for your own personal informational, educational or other non-commercial purposes unless otherwise expressly indicated; 2) all copies you make must properly attribute the appropriate source, including any copyright or other proprietary notices originally shown or included in the materials; 3) you may not modify any of the materials found at this website unless otherwise expressly indicated, nor attempt to pass off any materials found at this website as your own; 4) you may not use, reproduce or publicly display or perform, or distribute any of the materials within this website for any commercial or public purpose, unless Cameyo has given you prior written consent to do so; 5) you may not “mirror” or “frame” any portions of this website in any other environment without prior written consent from Cameyo; and 6) you may not display or transmit Cameyo RSS feed content in a manner that does not permit successful linking to, redirection to, or delivery of the applicable official Cameyo URL, and you may not insert any intermediate page, splash page, or other content between the Cameyo RSS link and the applicable official Cameyo URL. Cameyo reserves the right to terminate the access of any user in its sole discretion, including users who do not observe these Terms and Conditions or who infringe or otherwise violate the rights of others.

Cameyo provides proprietary information, including copyrighted materials, about its software and services on this website for the benefit of its customers and not for unrestricted use by the public. You agree that you may not use, or allow any other person or entity to use, any materials found on this website for the purpose of investigating, supporting, threatening or filing any intellectual property infringement claim against Cameyo or its affiliates or for the purpose of developing or using an offering or product directly or indirectly competing with an offering or product from Cameyo. Your failure to comply with these prohibitions constitutes breach of these Terms and Conditions with respect to the materials at issue. Each instance of noncompliance (e.g., each use of a digital file contrary to these Terms and Conditions) constitutes a separate instance of breach and subjects you to a payment obligation in the amount of $75,000 USD per instance of breach, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. In addition, Cameyo reserves the right to seek damages for infringement for copyrighted materials. You agree that damages reasonably anticipated from a potential breach are difficult to ascertain because of their indefiniteness or uncertainty and the amount stipulated is reasonably proportionate to the damages actually caused by the breach.

You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to Cameyo via this website any material that is unlawful, obscene, pornographic, libelous, defamatory, threatening or otherwise inappropriate.
