Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

**Marketing**  
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.

We may use your data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you. You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased from us and you have consented to receiving that marketing, where consent is required.

Third party marketing  
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party who may then contact you for their own marketing purposes.

**Opting out**  
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing communication sent to you. Alternatively you can contact us directly by calling +44(0)1270 444 450.

**We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:**

* Where processing your data is necessary for the performance of a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you
* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Legitimate interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service / product and overall experience. We make sure that we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests
* Where we need to comply with a legal obligation

  
Generally we do not rely on consent as a lawful basis for processing your personal data. However we will get your consent where it is required before sending direct marketing communications to you. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time.

**Purposes for which we will use your personal data

5\. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in Section 4, ‘How we use your personal data’:

* Internal third parties (such as other companies within the Volkswagen Group)
* External third parties (such as Retailers, service providers acting on our behalf, professional advisers and other authorities/ regulatory bodies)
* Third parties, to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.  
 

6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (subject also to any relevant data localisation legislation). It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA who works for us or for one of our suppliers, such as your local Bentley Retailer. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and provision of support services. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and current UK Data Protection Law unless otherwise stated.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing at least one of the following safeguards:

* We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission
* Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific model contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe

7\. DATA SECURITY

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

8\. DATA RETENTION

**How long will you use my personal data for?**  
We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.  
In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that you are not identifiable and the data can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes. In this case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.  
 

9\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

**Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:**

* Request access to your personal data, commonly known as a "data subject access request". This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you
* Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. In many instances you can amend the personal data directly
* Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request
* Object to processing of your personal data. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms in this instance
* Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
* If you want us to establish the data's accuracy
* Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
* Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
* You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
* Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party
* Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our DPO:

**Fees  
**You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you  
**We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond  
**We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
