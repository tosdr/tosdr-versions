Lively Direct Privacy Policy
============================

The Lively flip cell phone and medical alert are sold by Journey Health & Lifestyle™, formerly known as firstSTREET. At Journey Health & Lifestyle™, we understand that the protection of consumers’ privacy is an important public concern. Accordingly, we have adopted this Privacy Statement to serve as the foundation for our internal privacy policies and procedures. It is our commitment to providing meaningful privacy protection for our customers.

2\. Information security
------------------------

We maintain technical and organizational safeguards to protect the confidentiality of personal information about our customers against unauthorized access or disclosure, accidental loss, alteration or destruction.

3\. Information Quality
-----------------------

We maintain procedures to assure that the personal information we collect is accurate, up-to-date and as complete as possible. If we obtain information about individuals who are not our present customers, we strive to treat this information in the same manner as we treat information about our existing customers.

4\. Use of Customer Information
-------------------------------

We collect personal information from our customers themselves, from when we provide products or services to our customers and from consumer reporting agencies and outside sources. We use personal information only for purposes of administering our business activities, providing service and making available other products and services to our present and prospective customers.

The personal information that our customers give us, and information about our customers’ orders may be shared with third parties. These marketing partners may use this information to send our customers offers of interest.

We use third parties to improve our ability to identify visitors to our website. As part of this service, we may make available identifiers to these third parties including our visitors’ IP addresses, cookies, and hashed versions of email addresses captured from your visit. We, and third parties, use this data to obtain more information about our visitors and reach out to them through other channels, such as email and/or direct mail. You have the right to opt-out of this activity.

5\. Do Not Solicit Option
-------------------------

We recognize that some of our customers do not want to be solicited for offers and promotions from us. So, we provide our customers the option to have their names and addresses removed from our mail and/or telephone solicitation lists. We have procedures that assure a consumer’s name, address and telephone number are removed from our marketing lists.

Customers that do not want us to contact them can let us know by calling, writing, or sending an email to us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.livelydirect.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Customers that do not want us to share their name and addresses with third party marketing partners can let us know by sending an email to us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.livelydirect.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

6\. Maintaining Customer Privacy with Our Business Partners
-----------------------------------------------------------

We strive to ensure that the companies we use as our business partners support our commitment to privacy protection in their handling of personal data about our customers.

7\. Employee Education
----------------------

We provide training to our employees about their responsibilities under this Privacy Statement, and we expect them to do their parts in protecting our customers’ privacy. We also conduct regular internal audits to support our commitment.

8\. Privacy Statement Availability to Customers
-----------------------------------------------

We want our customers to know about our commitment to providing privacy protection. Therefore, this Privacy Statement is available upon request to customers, investors, employees, governmental authorities and members of the general public.
