**11\. Dispute Resolution; including MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS WAIVER**

Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms and/or the Site, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties between you and either us or a Third Party Service Provider (a “Dispute”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If the parties are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to American Arbitration Association rules and procedures for commercial arbitration, including provisions for the resolution of consumer disputes, if applicable (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Either party may bring a Dispute in small claims court in New Castle County, Delaware to the extent permitted by the Arbitration Rules. If the amount in controversy is less than $10,000, the parties agree that the Dispute will be decided on the basis of written submissions without a hearing. The decision of the arbitrator will be final without option to appeal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive, special, consequential, or indirect damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees shall be divided in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. No disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE; AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PRESENT ITS CLAIM OR DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW OR BEFORE A JURY. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s), if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

**12\. Third Party Service Providers as Third Party Beneficiaries**

In fulfilling a request to contact a consumer through our Site, the Third Party Service Providers are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as it relates to Sections 3 and 10 of these Terms.

**13\. Governing Law**

The Terms are governed according to the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. Subject to the dispute resolution process described above, all claims, disputes, and suits must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware, and the parties agree to the jurisdiction thereof.

**14\. Indemnity**

You will defend, indemnify, and hold us, the Third Party Service Providers, and our respective affiliates, vendors, service providers, officers, directors, owners, employees, contractors, and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, governmental investigations, demands, actions, and proceedings, real or threatened, and all losses, judgments, awards, settlements, damages, fines, injuries, penalties, and costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of or related to (i) any breach or alleged breach of these Terms by you; (ii) your violation of any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your negligence or willful misconduct; or (iv) your use of the Site.

We provide links as a convenience and the inclusion of the link does not imply that we endorse or accept any responsibility for the content on those sites. We are not responsible for content including but not limited to advertising claims, special offers, illustrations, names or endorsements on any other sites to which the Site may be linked to or from which the Site may be accessed. Further, we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with the linked site, unless specifically stated therein.

**17\. Miscellaneous**

The Terms constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, the parties intend that the offending provision be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be lawful and enforceable. Portions of the Terms which by their nature would survive termination of your use of the Site (e.g., disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, indemnification) shall be deemed to survive. The Terms do not create any joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between the parties. You agree that ambiguities in the Terms will not be construed against us by attribution of drafting. We may assign any of our rights or obligations to others at any time without notice to you.
