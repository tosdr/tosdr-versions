PRIVACY NOTICE
==============

Revised Date: July 10th, 2024

Auto Accident Team and its affiliated companies (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respect the privacy of all individuals. This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) in connection with your use of our website(s) on which this Privacy Policy is linked (collectively, “Sites”) and any transactions, interactions, or other engagements you might have with us (collectively, “Services”). For clarity, the term “Sites” does not include any sites owned or operated by third parties.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the Sites or Services, you consent to the collection and use of your information by us as set out in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy forms a part of and is incorporated into our [Terms of Service](https://autoaccidentteam.com/terms-of-use), and any capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Service. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE OR ACCESS THE SITE.

**ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

**Privacy Policy Changes**

This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently for any revisions or amendments. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, the revised policy will be posted on the Sites with the date of revision. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting. You will be deemed to have been made aware of and have accepted the changes by your continued use of our Sites or Services. If we determine that a change to this Privacy Policy will result in using your Personal Information acquired before the change being used in a materially new way, we will provide notice, such as by a posting on the Sites or an email to your last known email address, before using your Personal Information in the new way.

**Conflict Between this Policy and Laws and Regulations**

When federal, state, or local laws and regulations require a higher level of protection for your Personal Information, they take precedence over this Privacy Policy. The specific requirements of this Privacy Policy apply unless disallowed by applicable laws or regulations. Please be aware that the Sites and Services are subject to the laws of the United States of America and that your Personal Information will be processed in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Sites and Services are intended for use by individuals in the United States.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Personal Information**

We may collect information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with you (“Personal Information”), including:

* _Identifiers and Contact Information_ such as name, address, email address, phone number;
* _Protected Classification Characteristics_ such as age, marital status, gender, and veteran or military status;
* _Health Information_ such as a medical condition or diagnosis related to your request;

Some of the Personal Information listed above may be considered sensitive under relevant privacy laws. This includes health information. We refer to this type of Personal Information as “Sensitive Personal Information” in this Policy. Each type of Sensitive Personal Information may overlap with a category of Personal Information listed above.

The specific Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Sites and/or Services and your relationship with us.

**Business Information**

We also collect information about businesses and their representatives that engage with us such as EIN, TIN, address, phone number, email address, bank account information (collectively, “Business Information”). This information is generally not considered Personal Information because it relates to a business. If such Business Information relates to a business contact person, we will treat it as Personal Information.

**Usage Data and Sites Activity**

We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites (“Usage Data”). For example, each time you visit our Sites, we may automatically collect the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, the type of your operating system, the name of your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view on our Sites, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, and the number of clicks to, from, and within the Sites, and the duration of your visits to the Sites. If this information is reasonably capable of being associated with you, we treat it as Personal Information under the category Internet and Network Information. If this information is not reasonably capable of being individually associated with you, we treat it as Usage Data.

**Communication Recordings**

We may record calls and retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications between you and us. By communicating with us, you explicitly consent to our recording and retention of communications.

**HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION**

**From You**

We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us (online or offline), use the Sites or Services, enter into a relationship with us, and at other times.

We will process verified requests within 45 days, subject to any applicable exceptions and extensions permitted by law.

If you are an Oregon resident, you have the right to request once per 12-month period that we provide you with a list of specific third parties to whom we disclosed (a) your Personal Information or (b) any Personal Information. We have the discretion to determine which list to provide.

**Right to Deletion**

You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information we collected about you.

**Submitting a Request**

If you are a resident of a state that provides privacy rights and you would like to exercise your rights, you may submit a request by email to [info@autoaccidentteam.com](mailto:info@autoaccidentteam.com) or using this [online form](https://autoaccidentteam.com/do-not-sell-my-information). After you submit your request, we may contact you to obtain additional information necessary to verify your identity.

**Non-Discrimination Notice**

We will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their privacy rights under law or this Privacy Policy.

**DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS**

Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other “Do Not Track” mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised Privacy Policy on the Sites.

**COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT**

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information, Usage Data, and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our sole discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to legal requests (including court orders, investigative demands, and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of ourselves, consumers, or any other third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with law.

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your Personal Information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the Personal Information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide Personal Information to us, and we encourage you to exercise discretion regarding the Personal Information you choose to disclose.
