Privacy for All
===============

At Wickr, we believe privacy is a universal human right. We know that privacy fuels global innovation and economic growth and empowers democracy.

Privacy cannot be only for a select few individuals or organizations. That is not the basis of a fair, safe and secure society.

This belief is essential to our fundamental philosophy that the communications of all Wickr users should always be private at all costs. The privacy of Wickr users – whether everyday citizens, members of the military or business professionals working in some of the world’s most critical organizations – is essential to our mission of delivering the world’s most secure communications platform.

_We call this privacy for all._

This simple yet profound belief drives all our decisions – even when those decisions are neither easy nor popular.

Citizens from around the world regularly face arguments for limiting privacy. We couldn’t disagree more. Privacy should never be limited.

Other communications platforms store or share their users’ communications with governing bodies or third-parties. Wickr does not. We will never share the communications of Wickr users. In fact, Wickr does not have access to any encrypted communication conducted on our platform and conversations are never stored on our servers, thanks to our privacy-first architecture. Wickr enables enterprises to implement their own message archival and monitoring regimes in accordance with internal policies and government regulations.

Today, when the right to privacy is under attack across the world, we stand by our beliefs and our role as leaders in end-to-end encryption.

Wickr is committed to operating in an environment of complete transparency. Learn more about Wickr’s privacy position and how we respond to law enforcement requests using the buttons above.

**Why We Use Cookies**

As a privacy-focused company, Wickr has built and operated its platform as a ‘zero-knowledge’ system to ensure that our users have full control and ownership of their communications. This means that Wickr as a company is built private-by-design from its very start to provide secure its communications service, and does not collect or monetize your content.

Your trust is important to us and we tirelessly work on improving our services and raising awareness about our products, which are designed to ensure our users’ security and privacy. To accomplish these goals, we use cookies that enable us to learn how our website visitors navigate our content and how web users interact with our marketing materials so we can understand how to improve our website and our content so we can continue building privacy and collaboration-enhancing features accessible to all users. We may also use cookies to recommend content that might interest you based on your past interactions with us. We make every reasonable effort to: a) minimize the information we collect to operate the service, b) limit the amount of time we keep it and c) enable our users to proactively minimize the data they store on their devices to ensure its privacy and security.

**What Are Cookies?** 

A cookie is a small text file, unique to your device or browser, that helps us learn about things like when users arrive at our site, how they use the site, when they leave, and when they come back.   We use session-based, persistent cookies and pixel-tags. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. Pixel tags, which are small blocks of code installed in or on a webpage, also provide us with insight about our users’ preferences. It’s important to note that no information about web traffic associated with our marketing and web optimization efforts can be traced back to the actual end users of Wickr products.

**What Types of Cookies We Use**

In addition to our own cookies, we use third-party cookies through partners like Google Analytics to understand website performance and customer interest in our product, as well as optimize the on-boarding experience for new network administrators (on Wickr Pro only). These cookies do not allow us to know your personal information, only how you interact with our website and marketing materials published on the web.  
We provide the utmost transparency on and up-to-date overview of cookies used on our website including the ability for website visitors to check, withdraw or modify consent for non-necessary cookies at any time.

**Deleting Cookies**

In addition to modifying cookies by visiting our website, you can also control and delete cookies from your browser. _Here is how to do so on different browsers:_

[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored) | [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647) | [Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411?locale=en_US)

**Disabling Cookies**

You can also disable or block cookies to prevent them from being used in the first place.

For more information about these controls, visit your browser or device’s help material.

The [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and other leading digital rights organizations recommend a number of ways to do this:

* Users can opt out of providing their website activity to Google Analytics via the [Google Analytics Opt-Out browser add-on](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en).
* Users can install [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) and enable EasyPrivacy to block ads and disable 3rd party tracking;
* Users can also change cookie settings on the browser to “disallow” 3rd party cookies and “set cookies to expire when you exit your browser.”
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411)
* Users can turn off referers with the extension [Referer Control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/referer-control/hnkcfpcejkafcihlgbojoidoihckciin). This will prevent an HTTP request from giving user information to websites.
* Finally, users can install EFF’s browser add-on [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) or [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger). Details on how to set these features up can be found [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/4-simple-changes-protect-your-privacy-online).
