### Details of Personal Data Processing

In the course of our business, we collect and process the Personal Data as set out in this Policy. This may include data we receive directly from a Data Subject (for example, by completing forms or by corresponding with us by mail, phone, email, or otherwise) and data we receive from other sources (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, credit reference agencies, government bodies, and others).

We will only process Personal Data for the specific purposes set out in this Policy or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the applicable law. We will notify those purposes to the Data Subject when we first collect the data or as soon as possible thereafter.

Limited personal data concerning the teachers use of the features will be processed on behalf of the school or district as part of the service.

The school or district will be the controller related to such sub-processors processing of personal data in relation to providing the AI-features. Prior to engaging new sub-processors providing AI services, Showbie will notify the school or district in writing, thereby giving the school or district the opportunity to opt-out the use of such services.

#### If you are a Teacher/Administrator:

We collect and process your name, address, school/institution name, contact details, and payment information to facilitate payment of our Services; for internal and external auditing and to make appropriate financial returns to revenue; to process payment of invoices etc. Our payment system also collects the IP address of users who pay online to facilitate credit card location verification.

Users can log in to our Services directly using the Showbie app/web page or by using certain specified third-party accounts such as Google and Microsoft. We may add other third-party sign-on functionality in the future. By signing on in using a third-party account, we use your name, profile picture (if available), and email address to authenticate your identity and to pre-populate your profile.

Some third-party services, such as Google, give you the option to post or share information about your use of the services to your third-party account. The settings for that kind of sharing are outside of our Services. It’s up to you to check the sharing and privacy settings on any third-party accounts.

The lawful basis for this processing is the Terms of Use you have agreed to, or our legitimate interest in facilitating the provision of the Applications and Services to our customers, including processing payment.

If you input the Personal Data of others into the application, you are responsible for ensuring that you have obtained any permissions or authorizations for any Personal Data of others that you input or send through the Application.

We will communicate with you regarding our Services and your account. We will do this via the internet and via the email address you have provided. You acknowledge that data and information transmitted over the internet is susceptible to error or security breaches.

The lawful basis for this activity is the agreement you have entered into or our legitimate interests in providing you with important information about the Services and your account.

#### If you are a Student:

Showbie collects limited Personal Data from minor students only as needed for the operation and management of the Services provided by Showbie, and only where that student’s school board, educational institution, or teacher has contracted with Showbie to do so. Showbie collects names, usernames, and, optionally, profile pictures. This profile information collected allows students to interact with other teachers, students, and other users from their school or institution as more particularly described below.

(a) **It is the responsibility of our customers, e.g. the school board, educational institution, or teacher to obtain the consent of parents/legal guardians prior to our collection of such student Personal Data. If you are a minor student, do not upload or send any Personal Data about yourself or other students to Showbie, other than what is requested upon signing up for the Services.** If we discover we have the Personal Data of a student without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, we will permanently destroy that information as quickly as possible. If you believe a student may have provided us Personal Data without consent of a parent/legal guardian, or information in excess of what we request upon sign-up, please contact us at [**privacy@showbie.com**](mailto:privacy@showbie.com).

(b) Students can sign up to our Services with a username and password. Your teacher may provide you with a class code which grants you access to that teacher’s virtual classroom, and also the ability to view other users’ profiles and contributions to discussions/groups. Students are unable to see the grades of other students, irrespective of whether or not they are members of the same course group on the site.

(c) Students should be aware that their parent/legal guardian has access to all information within or associated with their Showbie account, including, but not limited to, messages between other students, teachers, and assignment grades.

(d) The Showbie site allows students and teachers to interact, post information, assignments, grades, and other similar information. This information will also form part of the Personal Data of students. However, Showbie is a Data Processor of this Personal Data on behalf of the students’ school board, educational institution or teacher who has contracted with Showbie, and that school board, educational institution, or teacher is the Data Controller.

(e) Showbie conducts a small number of user research interviews to gather constructive feedback from the users of the Showbie services. The feedback is used to improve and develop the services. Before conducting a user research interview we ask for the consent from those we interview, which are mostly teachers or administrators. When conducting the interview, some student data may be processed. This may occur as a natural part of the interview, e.g., if a teacher shares their Showbie interface with us during the interview. Showbie will make every effort to limit the collection of student data in interviews and the scope of the research is never targeted to student data. The incidental processing of student data may include the following: name of the organization, geographic location, age of students, subjects taught, extracurriculars participated in, example student work (uploaded files, annotated documents, comments), student names, student profile pictures, student class enrolment. For the processing of student data as part of the user research interviews, Showbie is the Data Controller.

When Showbie acts as a Data Controller for the purposes set out above, the lawful basis for the processing is the agreement entered into with us, or our legitimate interests in providing the Application and Services through our agreement with your school board, educational institution, teacher, or the like.

#### If you are a Parent:

**Parents** can create a Showbie account using their first name, last name, and email address. A parent account allows a parent to log in and access their child’s work. Parents don’t have access to any other student’s work ,nor any shared/group discussion.

When processing Personal Data about parents, our lawful basis is the agreement we have entered into with the parent.

#### Information collected as part of our sales and marketing efforts:

We collect, use and disclose Personal Data of administrative users or teachers for marketing purposes provided it does **not direct advertising to any student users**, and provided that student Personal Data is not used or disclosed. We collect Personal Data relating to administrative users or teachers for relevant product or marketing communications. We will never direct advertising to students or disclose student Personal Data. Users may unsubscribe from marketing notifications at any time.

We collect, aggregate, and anonymize data for system monitoring, quality control, marketing, and product improvement purposes, provided it does not entail processing of any Personal Data of users.

The lawful basis for this activity is legitimate interest in selling and marketing our services when advertising to existing customers and consent when advertising to new and potential customers.

In any case, we will challenge any overbroad or inappropriate disclosure and disclose only the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary to satisfy an access request.

### How Long do we Keep Hold of Your Information?
