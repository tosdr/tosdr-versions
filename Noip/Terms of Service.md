### Domain Registration Agreement

This Domain Name Registration Agreement ("Agreement")is made by and between No-IP, Inc. ("No-IP"), a Nevada corporation, and you, your heirs, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, "You"), and is made effective as of the date of electronic execution. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your use of No-IP's Domain Name Registration and represents the entire agreement between You and No-IP. By participating in this transaction, You acknowledge that You have read, understand and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the ICANN Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy[http://www.icann.org/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm](http://www.icann.org/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm&sa=D&ust=1557185954688000) along with any new, different or additional terms, conditions or policies, including the Universal Terms of Service which No-IP may establish from time to time. Such terms, conditions or policies may be found [here](https://www.noip.com/legal/tos).

You also agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement for transactions entered into on Your behalf by anyone acting as Your agent, and transactions entered into by anyone who uses the account You have established with No-IP, whether or not the transactions were on Your behalf. You acknowledge that No-IP's acceptance of any application made by You for services provided by No-IP will take place at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") accredited registrar's offices located in Reno, Nevada, USA.

You acknowledge that No-IP is a registrar bound by an agreement between No-IP and ICANN. You agree that No-IP may modify this agreement in order to comply with applicable law and the terms and conditions set forth by ICANN and/or the Registry Administrator chosen by ICANN, as well as any registration rules or policies that may be published from time to time by No-IP.

### 1\. Fees

In consideration for the services and products ("Service" or "Services") purchased by You and provided to You by No-IP, You agree to pay No-IP at the time service is provided. Payment is to be made by You by providing either a valid credit card, an online check, or using PayPal to establish a cash reserve for charge by No-IP (collectively, the "Payment Method"). All personal checks will be delayed fourteen (14) days until the money is credited, which may delay Your usage of the Service, and any check that bounces will result in a $25 bounced check fee. If You purchase an automatically renewing Service by personal check, it is Your responsibility to arrange for each renewal payment. You understand that ICANN requires No-IP to collect a small registration fee when you purchase your domain name registration. You agree to pay such fees. Payments are non-refundable. If for any reason No-IP is unable to charge Your Payment Method for the full amount owed No-IP for the service provided, or if No-IP is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, You agree that No-IP may pursue all available remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that the remedies No-IP may pursue in order to effect payment include, but will not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to You of any domain names registered or renewed on Your behalf. No-IP reserves the right to charge a reasonable service fee for administrative tasks outside the scope of its regular services. These include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that cannot be handled via email but require personal service, and disputes that require legal services. These charges will be billed to the Payment Method we have on file for You. You may change your Payment Method at any time by logging into Your [Account Manager](https://www.noip.com/login).

Current fees can be found [here](https://www.noip.com/pricing).

### 2\. Domain Name Renewals

When You register a domain name, your domain name will be automatically renewed on the expiration date. The renewal term will be for one year and will continue to renew at that interval until you cancel the service. No-IP will automatically renew any domain name that is active and not canceled at the end of the service term, and will take payment from the Payment Method You have on file with No-IP, at No-IP's then current rates. If a payment method is not on file, renewal notifications will be sent via email to the email address on file prior to the next billing date.. If for any reason No-IP is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method You have on file, and You fail to pay Your invoice, Your domain name registration will expire. Notices of expiration will be sent via email to the email address on file on the day of expiration. Additionally, Past Due notices are sent via emailafter the expiration date. It is Your responsibility to keep current Your Payment Method information, which includes the expiration date if You are using a credit card.You agree that No-IP will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that You fail to renew. In any case, if You fail to renew Your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply. If You signed up for domain masking, domain forwarding, or any other similar service, with Your domain registration, these services may be automatically renewed when Your domain registration is up for renewal, and You may incur an additional renewal fee unless You cancel in advance.

If you fail to renew your domain name, you agree that No-IP may, at its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf. If No-IP decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may reimburse No-IP for the renewal and keep your domain name. The Renewal Grace Period is currently 30 days but subject to change under the terms of Section 3 of this Agreement. If you do not reimburse No-IP for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period, then your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion. At that point, you will have a 30 day period during which you may pay No-IP a Redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The Redemption fee is currently $150 USD. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30 day redemption period, No-IP may, at its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.

If your domain is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30 day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay No-IP a redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is currently $150. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period, then the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.

Current renewal fees can be found [here](https://www.noip.com/pricing).

You further agree that No-IP may charge You a small fee if You cancel Your domain within the five (5) day grace period after registering Your domain with No-IP. No-IP will not charge You a fee if No-IP cancels Your domain name during this period because of fraud.

You agree that No-IP may modify this agreement from time to time. No-IP may also discontinue services it provides under this agreement. You agree to be bound by any changes No-IP may reasonably make to this agreement when such changes become effective.

You agree to review No-IP's web site periodically to determine if changes have been made to the Dispute Resolution Policy. If You cancel Your agreement with No-IP as a result of the modified Dispute Resolution Policy, no fees will be refunded to You.

You agree that if a dispute arises as a result of one or more domain names You have registered using No-IP, You will indemnify, defend and hold No-IP harmless as provided for in this agreement. You also agree that if No-IP is notified that a complaint has been filed with a governmental, administrative or judicial body, regarding a domain name registered by You using No-IP, No-IP, in its sole discretion, may take whatever action No-IP deems necessary regarding further modification, assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event, You agree to hold No-IP harmless for any action taken by No-IP.

In order to further protect Your domain, any domain registered with No-IP or transferred to No-IP shall be placed on lock status. The domain must be placed on unlock status in order to modify any of the Whois information (including the name servers) or initiate a transfer of the domain name away from No-IP to a new Registrar. You may log into Your account with No-IP at any time after Your domain name has been successfully transferred to No-IP, and change the status to unlock.

In the event You are purchasing a domain name on behalf of a third party customer, You agree to inform any such customer that they are in fact registering their domain name through No-IP and that No-IP is an accredited registrar with ICANN. You agree to provide complete, accurate and current data for each such registrant to be added to a registry in accordance with ICANN requirements for inclusion in the Whois database. You agree not to represent that You are an ICANN accredited registrar or that You are in any way providing superior access to the ICANN Domain Name Registry.

### 21\. Additional Provisions Applicable To .BIZ Registrants

#### \* .BIZ Restrictions \*

Registrations in the .BIZ TLD must be used or intended to be used primarily for bona fide business or commercial purposes. For purposes of the .BIZ Registration Restrictions ("Restrictions"), "bona fide business or commercial use" shall mean the bona fide use or bona fide intent to use the domain name or any content, software, materials, graphics or other information thereon, to permit Internet users to access one or more host computers through the DNS:

1. To exchange goods, services, or property of any kind;
2. In the ordinary course of trade or business; or
3. To facilitate (i) the exchange of goods, services, information, or property of any kind; or, (ii) the ordinary course of trade or business. Registering a domain name solely for the purposes of (1) selling, trading or leasing the domain name for compensation, or (2) the unsolicited offering to sell, trade or lease the domain name for compensation shall not constitute a "bona fide business or commercial use" of that domain name.

#### \* .BIZ Certification \*

As a .BIZ domain name registrant, You hereby certify to the best of Your knowledge that:

1. The registered domain name will be used primarily for bona fide business or commercial purposes and not (i) exclusively for personal use; or (ii) solely for the purposes of (1) selling, trading or leasing the domain name for compensation, or (2) the unsolicited offering to sell, trade or lease the domain name for compensation. More information on the .BIZ restrictions, which are incorporated herein by reference, are available online .
2. You have the authority to enter into the registration agreement; and
3. The registered domain name is reasonably related to Your business or intended commercial purpose at the time of registration.

#### \* Domain Name Dispute Policy \*

If You reserved or registered a .BIZ domain name through us, You agree to be bound by our current domain name dispute policy that is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement by reference. Please take the time to familiarize Yourself with that policy. In addition, You hereby acknowledge that You have read and understood and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the following documents, as they may be amended from time to time, which are hereby incorporated and made an integral part of this Agreement:

1. The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Policy;
2. The Start-up Trademark Opposition Policy ("STOP")[http://www.neulevel.biz/ardp/docs/stop.html](http://www.neulevel.biz/ardp/docs/stop.html&sa=D&ust=1557185954708000); and
3. The .BIZ Restrictions Dispute Resolution Criteria and Rules [http://www.neulevel.biz/ardp/docs/rdrp.html](http://www.neulevel.biz/ardp/docs/rdrp.html&sa=D&ust=1557185954708000)\>.

The STOP sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between a registrant of a .BIZ domain name ("Registrant") with any third party (other than Registry Operator or Registrar) over the registration or use of a .BIZ domain name registered by Registrant that is subject to the Intellectual Property Claim Service. The Intellectual Property Claim Service, a service introduced by Registry Operator to notify a trademark or service mark holder ("Claimant") that a second-level domain name has been registered in which that Claimant claims intellectual property rights. In accordance with the STOP and its associated Rules, those Claimants will have the right to challenge registrations through independent ICANN-accredited dispute resolution providers.

The UDRP sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between a Registrant and any party other than the Registry Operator or Registrar over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by Registrant.

The RDRP sets forth the terms under which any allegation that a domain name is not used primarily for business or commercial purposes shall be enforced on a case-by-case, fact specific basis by an independent ICANN-accredited dispute provider. None of the Restrictions will be enforced directly by or through the Registry Operator. The Registry Operator will not review, monitor, or otherwise verify that any particular domain name is being used primarily for business or commercial purposes or that a domain name is being used in compliance with the SUDRP or UDRP processes.

#### \* Domain Name Disputes \*

You agree that, if Your use of our domain name registration services is challenged by a third party, You will be subject to the provisions specified in our dispute policy in effect at the time of the dispute. You agree that in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, You will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Agreement. If we are notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding Your use of our domain name registration services, You agree not to make any changes to Your domain name record without our prior approval. We may not allow You to make changes to such domain name record until (i) we are directed to do so by the judicial or administrative body, or (ii) we receive notification by You and the other party contesting Your registration and use of our domain name registration services that the dispute has been settled. Furthermore, You agree that if You are subject to litigation regarding Your registration and use of our domain name registration services, we may deposit control of Your domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by supplying a party with a registrar certificate from us.

#### \* Reservation of Rights \*
