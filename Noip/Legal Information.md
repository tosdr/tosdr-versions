### Domain Name Transfer Agreement

This Domain Name Transfer Agreement ("Agreement") is by and between Vitalwerks Internet Solutions, LLC. ("No-IP") a/an Nevada limited liability corporation and You, Your heirs, agents, successors and assigns ("You"), and is made effective as of the date of electronic execution. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your use of No-IP's Domain Name Transfer and represents the entire agreement between You and No-IP. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of transferring a registered domain name from any other Registrar TO No-IP (as "Registrar"). By participating in this transaction, You acknowledge that You have read, understand and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including our dispute policy, along with any new, different or additional terms, conditions or policies including the Universal Terms of Service which No-IP may establish from time to time. Such Agreements may be found in the [No-IP Terms of Service](https://www.noip.com/legal/tos).

In addition to transactions entered into by You on Your behalf, You also agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement for transactions entered into on Your behalf by anyone acting as Your Agent, and transactions entered into by anyone who uses the account You've established with No-IP, whether or not the transactions were in Your behalf. You acknowledge that No-IP's acceptance of any application made by You for services provided by No-IP will take place at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") accredited registrar's offices located in Reno, Nevada, USA.

You acknowledge that No-IP or its licensor is a registrar bound by an agreement between No-IP or its licensor and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"). You agree that No-IP or its licensor may modify this agreement in order to comply with applicable law and the terms and conditions set forth by the Internet ICANN and/or the Registry Administrator chosen by ICANN, as well as any registration rules or policies that may be published from time to time by No-IP or its licensor.

This Document will be effective upon acceptance of the Registration and Transfer agreements in Step 3 of the Online Transfer Application process.

### Steps for Transferring Your Domain Name Registration

NOTE: Once the transfer is complete, you will be able to RENEW, MODIFY DNS, and perform other functions by logging into Your Account Manager. Complete all required information requested through the online transfer application, i.e. contact information, nameserver information, etc. Proceed through to the shopping cart and pay for your transfer(s). Update your Registrant and Administrative contact's email address at your current registrar. We will be contacting the Registrant's email address, or if not provided by the registrar, the Administrative contact's email address for transfer approval. The transfer will only be initiated upon approval from your Registrant or Administrative contact. Once initiated, a transfer will be accepted or denied by the losing registrar within 7 days.

### Failed or Rejected Transfer Requests

No-IP may elect to accept or reject your domain name transfer application for any reason at its sole discretion. Rejections may include, but are not limited to: The current Registrar rejected the transfer. The original registration took place less than sixty (60) days prior to the transfer request. The domain name has been placed in a locked status by either the Registry or by the losing registrar. The domain was transferred to No-IP less than sixty (60) days prior to the transfer request. The domain name expired but was not renewed. The domain name expired and was renewed during the forty-five (45) day grace period, and the forty-five (45) day grace period has not yet passed. The Domain Name Registrant was changed less than sixty (60) days prior to the transfer request. Any pending bankruptcy of the current domain name holder. Any dispute over the identity of the domain name holder. Any situation described in the Dispute Policy. Transfer orders over thirty (30) days old.

### Terms for Transferring Domain Names

Upon successful transfer, No-IP.com shall become the Registrar of Record. You will still be the Registrant of the domain -- No-IP will become the Registrar of the domain name. Your registration will be automatically extended by one year. Domain name registration transfers may only be initiated once acceptance of the transfer agreement is recorded, payment is made and the Administrative contact has responded positively to our email message asking for Permission to Transfer. The email message asking for Permission to Transfer will be sent to the Domain Name(s) Administrative contact as identified in the previous Registrar's WHO-IS database. You agree to retain a copy for Your own records of the receipt for purchase of Your domain name. The Administrative contact will be acting on behalf of the Registrant and has legal authority to initiate this transfer request. You are responsible for updating the Administrative contact's email as identified in the previous Registrar's WHO-IS database.

### Transfers of Recently Renewed Domain Names

You understand that if you are transferring a domain name that has been recently renewed there is the potential that the renewal year will be lost. The renewal year will be lost if: the domain name was renewed during the forty-five (45) day grace period after the expiration date had passed; and forty-five (45) days have not yet passed since that expiration date. You understand and agree that No-IP is not responsible for this lost year and that No-IP will not credit that year to your domain. You will need to review the registration agreement you have with your previous registrar to determine if you are due a refund or credit for the lost year. Please contact your previous registrar if you have any questions about the lost year. You understand and agree that No-IP will not intervene in the recovery of any such lost registration years that occur during the transfer of your domain name.

### Limitation of Liability

YOU AGREE THAT No-IP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: ANY SUSPENSION OR LOSS OF THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION IN YOUR NAME USE OF YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION BY YOU OR OTHERS, WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU TO HAVE SUCH USE INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS ACCESS DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS TO THIS SITE OR THE WEB SITE(S) YOU ACCESS BY THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED IN YOUR NAME DATA NON-DELIVER, MIS-DELIVERY, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION OR OTHER MODIFICATION EVENTS BEYOND No-IP'S REASONABLE CONTROL THE PROCESSING OF THIS APPLICATION OF THE DISPUTE POLICY No-IP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF No-IP ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
