Terms of Use
============

Last updated: October 11, 2023

Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the https://www.befunky.com website and BeFunky mobile applications (the "Service") operated by BeFunky Inc ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.

Communications
--------------

By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.

### Purchases

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.

The Service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.

### Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies

We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.

We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

### Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions

Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the Promotion rules will apply.

### Content

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting Content on or through the Service, you represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.

You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third party posts on or through the Service. However, by posting Content using the Service you grant us the right and license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service.

BeFunky Inc has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all Content provided by users.

In addition, Content found on or through this Service are the property of BeFunky Inc or used with permission. You may not distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, download, repost, copy, or use said Content, whether in whole or in part, for commercial purposes or for personal gain, without express advance written permission from us.

### AI-Enabled Tools

Some of our product and service offerings utilize or are developed with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. These AI tools are designed to process vast amounts of data and generate outputs using algorithms, without human-like understanding or discretion.

Artificial intelligence, being in its nascent stage globally, might not always produce perfect or universally agreeable results. The outputs from our AI tools may sometimes not align with users’ expectations, personal beliefs, or sensitivities. It is crucial to understand that these results, being generated by algorithms, do not represent BeFunky’s views or intentions. While we strive to provide the most accurate and user-friendly experience possible, please be aware that the results from these AI tools are inherently probabilistic and might contain omissions, inaccuracies, or errors.

BeFunky neither warrants nor guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of outputs from our AI tools. We disclaim any liability or responsibility arising from the use, interpretation, or reliance on these outputs, including any indirect or consequential effects they might cause.

We value our users’ insights and feedback. If you have concerns, suggestions, or feedback regarding our AI-enabled features, or if you believe that the AI has produced content that may be considered offensive or inappropriate, please reach out to us:

* By email: support@befunky.com
* Through the [online form](https://www.befunky.com/contact-support/form/) on our website

### Accounts

When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 16, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization. You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene.

We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in our sole discretion.

BeFunky offers two different service accounts:

### Basic Account

If you select the "Basic Account", you may (i) use the BeFunky photo effects available via our website to alter your photos (a “Raw Photo”); (ii) distribute your Raw Photos that have undergone the BeFunky photo effects (a "BeFunky Image") to others; (iii) display your BeFunky Images on other web sites; including but not limited to, social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn; and (iv) you may sell or otherwise commercially benefit from your images edited with BeFunky Basic Account features.

### Plus Account

If you select the "Plus Account" and pay the Plus Account fees, you may: (i) use the BeFunky photo effects available via our website to alter your and others Raw Photos; (ii) distribute your and/or others' BeFunky Images to others; (iii) display your and/or others' BeFunky Images on other web sites including, but not limited to, social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn; and (iv) sell or otherwise commercially benefit from your images edited with BeFunky Plus Account features.

You may not grant your rights to any other person. For example, you may not allow others to use your Premium Account to create BeFunky Images.

### Plus Account Subscription Renewal

Your BeFunky subscription will automatically renew at its expiration date unless you cancel it prior to your payment date. A monthly subscription renews after 30 days from the purchase date and an annual subscription renews after 365 days from the purchase date. If you cancel your subscription any time before your payment processing date, you will continue to have an active subscription until the date on which your next payment was scheduled. For example, if your payment is scheduled for the 30th, but you cancel your subscription on the 15th, you will still have an active subscription until the 30th.

You may cancel your subscription at any time from your My Account page. Due to security and privacy reasons, under no circumstances will BeFunky cancel a subscriber’s subscription via email or phone. A subscription cancellation can only be made by the respective subscriber from their [My Account](https://www.befunky.com/my-account/) page.

If you decide to cancel your subscription after your payment has been processed, BeFunky will not issue a refund. Learn more about BeFunky's Renewal Policy by visiting this [page](https://www.befunky.com/renewal-policy/).

### Account Fees and Further Account Details

* The fees and other details with respect to each account are set forth at Account Details. BeFunky, at its sole discretion, may modify account fees.
* BeFunky will not be obligated to issue any refunds for any fees charged to your Credit/Debit Card/PayPal Account.

### Account Terms
