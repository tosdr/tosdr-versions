If you do not read, fully understand and agree to the AbcSubmit Terms, you must immediately leave the AbcSubmit Website and avoid or discontinue all use of the AbcSubmit Services.<br><br>By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy available at [//www.abcsubmit.com/site/privacy-policy](https://www.abcsubmit.com/site/privacy-policy/) (“Privacy Policy”). | By visiting our website or using our application and/or services, you are entering into a legal agreement with us, consisting of these Terms of Use, and our additional services’ legal terms.<br><br>By using our services, you signify your consent to these terms and you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy. You may not use our services if you do not consent to all our terms. |

### 1.3. User account

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| In order to access and use certain sections and features of the AbcSubmit Services, you must first register and create an account with AbcSubmit (“User Account”).<br><br>If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the AbcSubmit Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.<br><br>Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust – as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.<br><br>You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the AbcSubmit Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us.<br><br>In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below.<br><br>1. AbcSubmit will consider the owner of a User Account, User Platform and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant AbcSubmit Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in AbcSubmit’s records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created.<br>2. If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, AbcSubmit will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“Billing Information”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain’s registration information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the www.whois.net website or on AbcSubmit’s database, AbcSubmit will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, AbcSubmit will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, AbcSubmit shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the AbcSubmit Account as the owner of the User Platform.<br>3. Notwithstanding the forgoing, AbcSubmit shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event AbcSubmit deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by AbcSubmit. | To use certain of our services, you need to create a user account.<br><br>You should keep your username and password protected and safe, and only allow people you trust to access your account or website settings.<br><br>All activities that occur under your user account or website are your responsibility.<br><br>The account information you provide us must be your own (or your company’s), and be accurate and complete.<br><br>When a user account is disputed, we may determine the ownership of such user account. |
