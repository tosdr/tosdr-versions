![](https://a.storyblok.com/f/264268/1022x1033/bb0adbab13/vat-reference.jpg)

5.9 As not all legal persons are liable to a VAT identification number, we use the [VAT identification number search](https://apps.emta.ee/saqu/public/kmkrnr?lang=en) of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board to determine if the domestic user has an Estonian VAT identification number or if the user is from another EU country, we use the European Commission [VIES (VAT Information Exchange System)](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation) to determine if the user has a valid VAT number in its place of establishment. 

5.10 More information on pricing and VAT is available on our [Pricing page](https://multilogin.com/pricing/), [COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/112/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02006L0112-20190116), [Value-Added Tax Act](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527042020008/consolide) or contact customer support at [\[email protected\]](https://multilogin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for details.

**7 SECTION - CREATING AN APPLICATION ACCOUNT AND LOGIN TO THE APPLICATION** 

7.1 Creating an Application account is done via the Application. You need to have a working email and set a master password of your choosing. When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate, current and complete. 

7.2 Do not use either an invalid or fictitious non-existing email as we need to be able to contact you by email to provide confirmation of your account registration and go through the two-step install procedure of the Application. Using someone else’s email is not prohibited if you have the rights or permission to use such an e-mail, but keep in mind that such an email could diminish your account security. You must ensure that your email address is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. 

7.3 You can access the Application account with your master password later on. To use the functionalities of the Application, an active subscription plan is required. 

**8 SECTION - TWO-STEP VERIFICATION OF REGISTRATION IN THE APPLICATION**

9.1 You are responsible for all the activities on your account, and for keeping your set password for the application confidential. 

9.2 We cannot stress enough and urge you to save your set account password in multiple secure places. Your password is the key that encrypts your session data (cookies, tabs, local storage etc). **If you forget or lose your set master password, you will not be able to access your data stored on our server.** It is encrypted; there are no “back doors”, no “plan B”. **If you lose the master password, you have lost your data.** 

9.3 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your e-mail login credentials and Application master password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur through the use of your credentials using the Service. 

9.4 You agree to notify customer support at [\[email protected\]](https://multilogin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) at once, if you believe the confidentiality or your login credentials have been compromised or if you suspect unauthorized use of the Application or Service on your-behalf. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your credentials to you or any other third party. 

9.5 Remember that if you lose your master password, you can reset it, but you are not able to decrypt tabs, cookies and other personal data stored. However, you will retain access to a browser profile list, browser profile configuration settings and the account itself.
