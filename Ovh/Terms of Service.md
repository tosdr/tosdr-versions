1\. ORDERING SERVICES



1.1. Client Account. To be able to order OVHcloud Services, the Client must have a valid Client Account. The

Client creates its Client Account online within the OVHcloud Website. The Client shall provide all the

required information (email address, name, address, bank details, etc.), and undertakes that all of the

information thus provided is correct and up to date throughout the entire duration of the Contract. When

a Client Account is created and used by a third party, such person shall be considered as acting in the name

and on behalf of the Client, and having full power and authority to enter into and perform this Contract on

behalf of the Client.

2/22



1.2. Activation of the Client Account. Prior to the activation of the Client Account, as well as at any time while

the Contract is in effect, OVHcloud reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information sent by or for

the Client Account, and to request supporting documents from the Client. OVHcloud reserves the right not

to activate, or to deactivate, the Client Account in the event that any of the information provided by

the Client is incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.



1.3. Orders. Once its Client Account has been activated by OVHcloud, the Client can order Services.

Depending on Services, Orders can be sent using the OVHcloud Website and/or directly using the Client’s

Management Interface and/or using an API which OVHcloud may provide for said purpose. The Client is solely

responsible for the management of its Client Account and associated authentication credentials (user names,

passwords, etc.). Any Order sent from the Client Account is deemed to have been submitted by the Client, is

binding on the Client and agree to be bound by the Terms of Service. The terms and timescales for the provision

of Services vary depending on the Service ordered. Some Services are made available only upon receipt by

OVHcloud of payment from the Client in advance for the relevant Services. It is the responsibility of the Client to

ensure that the delivery terms for the ordered Services meet its needs.



2\. SERVICES



2.1. Applicable Terms of Service. The provision and use of the Services are governed by these Terms of Service,

the Specific Terms of Services applicable to the selected Services, any other conditions referred by the

General Terms of Services and Specific Terms of Service, such as Third Party Product Terms of Use, along

with any other information given to the Client during the Order (“Terms of Service”). The use and/or the

download of Third Party provided by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services constitutes acceptance of

the Third Party Product Terms of Use in accordance with Article 3.11. The Specific Terms of Service, and

the Third Party Product Terms of Use supplement these General Terms of Service. In the event of

contradiction, the Specific Terms of Service, as well as the General Terms of Service, shall prevail over the

Third Party Product Terms of Use. The Terms of Service in effect are available on the OVHcloud website, or

may be sent to the Client upon request addressed to OVHcloud Support. The Terms of Service may vary

depending on the country where the Services are located and the local laws that will be applicable.



2.2. Information related to the Services. OVHcloud makes available to the Client via the OVHcloud Website,

online resources which enable the Client to be informed of the characteristics of the Services offered. These

resources may include, in particular, (a) information regarding various available features, configurations,

options and ranges and(b) documentation, technical guides and/or examples (or use cases) on using the

Services so as to facilitate better understanding and use of the Services. The Client may obtain additional

information regarding the Services by contacting OVHcloud Support in accordance with article 4 below. In

cases where OVHcloud offers Services which comply with known standards or specific regulations which

apply to certain activities, OVHcloud shall communicate its scope of responsibility as well as the conditions

in which OVHcloud complies with said standards or regulations.



2.3. OVHcloud commitments and obligations. OVHcloud undertakes to exercise reasonable care and skill in

providing Services in accordance with the characteristics, terms and levels of Service stated in the Contract.

In particular, OVHcloud agrees to exercise reasonable skill and care in keeping in place a competent team

responsible for assisting the Client and handling Incidents (“OVHcloud Support”) and ensuring the

availability and security of Services in accordance with the applicable terms and performance levels. OVH

is subject to an obligation of means.

3/22



2.4. Subcontracting. Subject to the legal and contractual provisions applicable in matters of privacy and personal

information, OVHcloud may subcontract all or part of the Services to its Affiliates. Within the scope of the

Contract, OVHcloud may freely recourse to Third-Party Providers, without having to inform the Client or

sollicitate it prior approval. However, subject to contradictory provisions of Specific Terms of Service in

effect or Client’s specific agreement, no perfomance implying access to the Content stored by the Client

within the scope of the Services shall be subcontracted outside of OVHcloud Group. OVHcloud shall in all

cases remain primarily liable for the provision of the subcontracted Services.



3\. TERMS OF USE OF THE SERVICES



3.1. Compliance with the Terms of Service. The Client agrees to order and use the Services in accordance with

the Terms of Service in effect. The Services must be used in good faith. In particular, the Client undertakes

to comply with these General Terms of Service, the Specific Terms of Service and the applicable Third

Party Product Terms of Use, as well as any information communicated to the Client at the time of the

Order. When using the Services on behalf of a third party, or authorizing a third party to use the Service

and before any use of the Service(s) by such third party, the Client undertakes to communicate and to

validate the relevant terms to that third party and guarantee compliance of the Terms of Service by the

relevant third party.



3.2. Selection of Services. Before ordering and using the Services, the Client shall familiarize itself with all of

the applicable Terms of Services (in particular, the Specific Terms of Service and the Third Party Product

Terms of Use), and study all of the documentation, configuration, options and ranges of services available,

in order to select Services and characteristics suited to the Client's needs and those of the third parties

for whom or on whose behalf the Services will be used. In particular, the Client shall verify that the

Services are suited to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the activities performed within

the scope of the use of the Services. In order to obtain any additional information regarding the Services,

the Client may contact OVHcloud Support as set out in article “OVHcloud Support” hereafter. The terms

and characteristics of the Services shall be updated regularly. The Client is responsible to take note of

these updates, particularly when placing new orders.



3.3. Connection. To use the Services, the Client must ensure that it has access to a remote connection (such

as the Internet or a private network), which it is solely responsible for and bears the costs of. The Client

is hereby informed that the Internet presents technical hazards and security risks that are external to the

technical measures employed by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services. OVHcloud shall not be held

liable for any faults by Internet access providers or other third party data transport networks (including

but not limited to lack of reliability of connection lines, bandwidth fluctuations, connection interruptions,

etc.), nor for the consequences of said faults, particularly in cases when they result in the unavailability

or discontinuity of the Services.



3.4. Means of authentication. The Client is responsible for the management and confidentiality of the necessary

means of authentication for connecting to and using the Services. The Client shall ensure that the Users

are knowledgeable of and follow standard practices which enable them to maintain the confidentiality of

their authentication credentials. The Client is solely responsible for any consequences which may arise

from the loss, disclosure, or fraudulent or illicit use of the authentication credentials provided to Users.

OVHcloud shall in no way be held liable in this regard. The Client undertakes to immediately inform

OVHcloud of any loss or disclosure of any authentication credentials, and immediately proceed with

changing said authentication credentials.



3.5. Content. With the exception of items provided by OVHcloud, OVHcloud does not intervene in the handling

of the Content and is forbidden from accessing said Content for any other purpose than as necessary for

4/22



the execution of the Services. OVHcloud does not perform any verification, validation or update

operations on said Content. Likewise, OVHcloud does not perform any particular backups of Content

stored in the scope of the Services. Therefore, the Client is solely responsible for taking all necessary

measures to safeguard its data in order to protect it against risk of loss or degradation regardless of cause.

The Client shall ensure that the Content is legal and used in accordance with applicable industry standards,

laws and regulations. Any use of illegal or fraudulent Content (such as the distribution, publication,

storage or transmission of content of sexually explicit material, content that is obscene, offensive, hateful

or inflammatory, incites crimes against humanity, acts of terrorism, paedophilia, anti-Semitism, racism,

or content inciting hatred or discrimination towards individuals by reason of their gender, religion, sexual

orientation or identity, or disability), or the illegal or abusive use of Content (for example, fraudulent use

of content, or use of content in violation of rights belonging to a third party such as personality rights,

copyrights, patents, brands or other intellectual property rights) within the scope of Services is prohibited,

and can lead to, in accordance with the provisions of the Contract, the immediate suspension of all or part

of the Services provided under the Contract, the deactivation of the Client Account and/or the termination

of the Contract by OVHcloud, without prejudice to OVHcloud's other rights and remedies under the

Contract or at law.



3.6. Compliance with laws and regulations – Prohibited activities. The Services shall be used in a reasonable

manner, pursuant to all applicable laws and regulations. The Client undertakes to keep abreast of any

updates or changes to laws, regulations or documentation provided by OVHcloud. Explicitly forbidden

actions include, but are not limited to, (a) abuse, fraudulent or excessive use of the Services and resources

made available to the Client, particularly any use of a nature that threatens the stability and security of

OVHcloud systems or which can result in a degradation of the Services performance provided to other

OVHcloud clients, (b) intrusions or intrusion attempts launched from the Services (including, but not

limited to, port scanning, sniffing, spoofing, and more generally, attacks on external parties originating

from resources made available by OVHcloud) except Penetrating Tests specifically authorized by

OVHcloud pursuant to these General Terms of Service, (c) any use or attempted use of spam or any other

similar technique, and (d) use of illicit or prohibited Content as specified in article 3.5 “Content”. For clarity

sake, crypto currency mining, denial of service attacks, spamming, or any other activity designed to, or

capable of disrupting, damaging or limiting the functionality of any Services are strictly prohibited. This

does not affect the Client’s right to use consensus mechanisms such as “proof of stake” to verify

transactions in the blockchain, provided always such mechanism does not fall under the restriction set

forth in paragraph (a) above.



3.7. Suspension of Services. OVHcloud reserves the right to suspend all or part of the Services in the event of

(a) a known risk to the stability and/or security of the OVHcloud systems or environment by the Services

and/or Client Content, (b) scheduled maintenance, or (c) a request issued by a legal authority or

competent judicial authority (d) notification by a third party in accordance with applicable laws(e)

noncompliance of the Client with all or part of the Terms of Services. Said suspension may occur

immediately and without prior notice in case of urgency or necessity, and particularly in the case of an

event such as described in point (a) and (c) above, or in case of illicit or fraudulent use of the Services, or

use that is in violation of the rights of a third party, and more generally, of any use which may bind the

liability of OVHcloud. Except in relation to cases of judicial or legal requisitioning or noncompliance with

the Terms of Services, OVHcloud shall endeavour to minimise the impact of a suspension on the normal

operations of the Services. Any such suspensions shall in no way release the Client from its obligation to

pay the entirety of the amounts due to OVHcloud under the Contract, which is without prejudice to the

Client’s right to engage OVHcloud’s liability in accordance with article “Liability” hereafter in case such

suspensions result from OVHcloud’s failure to fulfil its obligations. The Client can consult the maintenance

schedule using the interface provided for this purpose. In the event any such suspension results in a failure

by the Client to fulfil its obligations under the Contract, the suspension shall take place without prejudice

5/22



to OVHcloud’s right to terminate the contract in accordance with article “Duration, Renewal and

Termination of Services” hereafter, and without prejudice to OVHcloud's other rights and remedies at

law. Except in cases of termination or nonrenewal of Services, suspensions of Services shall not result in

the deletion of the Client’s data. Unless suspensions result exclusively of OVHcloud’s failure to fulfil its

obligations, the duration of the aforementioned suspensions shall not count as unavailability of Services

in respect with the service level agreement provided in the Agreement.



3.8. Updates to Services. OVHcloud may modify the Services at any time, and may add, modify or remove

ranges, options or features, as well as upgrade their performance. The Services are described online on

the OVHcloud Website. The Client is responsible for keeping abreast of any updates to the Services, which

are immediately applicable to any new Orders. Concerning the Services in use by the Client, the latter

shall be informed by email or via its Management Interface of any substantial updates which are of a

nature to downgrade said Services, at least seven (7) calendar days before the implementation of said

update. Nevertheless, modifications to Third Party Products and urgent cases (such as security risks, or

legal or regulatory compliance updates) may result in immediate modifications to the Services. Subject to

the article “Condition Specific to Consumers”, in case of an update that degrades existing Services in use

by the Client (removal of functionality, performance downgrade, etc.), the Client may terminate the

relevant Services by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or through a specific form provided

in its Management Interface, within thirty (30) days from the date the relevant update is implemented.



3.9. Intellectual property. Usage rights. All of the items (software, Infrastructure, documentation, etc.) made

available to the Client by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services and during the term of the Contract

remain the exclusive property of OVHcloud or the third parties which have granted the rights to use them.

OVHcloud grants the Client a non-exclusive licence to use the items made available to it only in accordance

with and for the duration of the present Contract. With the exception of the aforementioned items made

available to the Client by OVHcloud in the provision of the Services, the Client remains solely responsible

for acquiring all of the authorisations and usage rights for the elements and Content (data, software,

applications, systems, websites, etc.) which it uses and operates in relation to the Services. The Client and

Users retain all intellectual property rights in their respective Content which OVHcloud shall not use

expect to the extent necessary for the performance of the Services. Subject to mandatory legal provisions

in effect, the Client is not authorized to decompile the software, source code and algorithms used in the

course of supplying the Services, notably to reverseengineer.



3.10. Compliance with Sanctions.

3.10.1. The Client shall at all times comply with Sanctions.

The Client represents and warrants that:

a) it is not, and was not previously, a person which has been designated under, targeted by, or

otherwise subject to, any Sanctions;

b) it is not owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, an individual or entity which has

been designated under, targeted by or otherwise subject to, any Sanctions; and

c) the Services will not be sold, exported, diverted or otherwise transferred to any individuals or

entities located in countries or regions subject to comprehensive Sanctions or trade embargoes, to the

governments of any of these countries or regions, or to any person or entity that is otherwise targeted

by Sanctions laws, or to any person or entity that is directly or indirectly involved in acts of terrorism,

or in connection with weapons of mass destruction or missile applications; and

d) it will not use, deal with, sell, supply, transfer or export, or broker the use, dealing with, sale,

supply, transfer or export of the Services in a manner that would otherwise violate Sanctions.

3.10.2. The Client shall inform OVHcloud immediately if any of the representations and warranties in

6/22



this clause cease to be accurate in any respect at any time during the term of this Contract.

3.10.3. OVHcloud is not obliged to perform any obligation under this Contract to the extent that the

performance of such obligation would breach Sanctions applicable to OVHcloud or expose OVH to any

risk of enforcement action or punitive or restrictive measures or other adverse action under Sanctions.

3.10.4. In the event that:

a) the Client breaches any provisions of this clause;

b) the representations and/or warranties set out in this clause cease to be accurate in any

respect at any time during the term of this Contract; or

c) clause 3.10.3 applies,

OVHcloud, in its discretion, shall be entitled to terminate all or part of this Contract, by providing

written notice to the Client upon such terms and with such effect as specified by OVHcloud in such

written notice. OVHcloud reserves the right to refuse Orders submitted (a) from countries subject to

Sanctions, or (b) by citizens of those countries or individuals subject to Sanctions.



3.11. Third Party Products. Subject to specific commitments undertaken within the scope of the applicable

Specific Terms of Service, (a) OVHcloud is not responsible for Third Party Products made available within

the scope of the Services which may contain technical errors, security vulnerabilities, incompatibilities or

instabilities, and offers no guarantee for the Third Party Products made available by OVHcloud to the

Client in the provision of the Services (including all related information and items such as software,

systems, applications, etc.), and (b) the Client is only authorised to use the Third Party. Products made

available to it by OVHcloud in accordance with the terms of the Contract, and in particular is forbidden

from decompiling, accessing the source code, reinstalling on any other infrastructure software or systems

made available to it. The Client uses the Third-Party Products entirely at its own risk, in accordance with

these Terms of Service, and is responsible to ensure that such Services are suited to its needs and the

purposes for which it uses them.



3.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services. Unless provided otherwise in the Specific Terms of Service, the

termination of Services for any reason whatsoever (in particular, the termination or non-renewal of the

Contract, failure to comply with the Terms of Service, etc.), as well as certain operations to update or

reinstall the Services, shall automatically result in the irreversible deletion of all Content (including

information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other items) that is reproduced, stored,

hosted, collected, transmitted, distributed, published and more generally used and/or operated by the

Client within the scope of the Services, including any potential backup. Before the termination or expiry

of the Services, and before proceeding with any delete operations, update or reinstallation of Services,

the Client is solely responsible to perform any operations (such as backup, transfer to a third party

solution, Snapshots, etc.) which are necessary to the preservation of its own Content. Upon request from

the Client, and subject to the stipulations of the article on “Confidentiality” below, OVHcloud shall provide

any technical information concerning the Services which may facilitate reversibility operations and the

Client’s Content recovery. Such provision of assistance may result in additional charges for time worked,

based on the financial terms available on the OVHcloud Website or upon request to OVHcloud Support.

However, OVHcloud does not proceed to any operation of restitution or Client’s Contents migration. Such

operations are under the Client’s exclusive responsibility. With the exception of any data which OVHcloud

must preserve in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the data referred to in article

“OVHcloud processes” below, and any data necessary for the defence of its rights, OVHcloud undertakes

not to keep a copy of the Client's data following the termination of Services, unless otherwise agreed by

the Parties or provided otherwise in the applicable Specific Terms of Service.

7/22



3.13. Penetration Tests. The Client is authorised to carry out penetration tests on the Services (hereinafter

"Penetration Test(s)") by itself or by a duly appointed third party auditor of its choice. The performance

of these operations does not require OVHcloud to be notified. These Penetration Tests shall be carried

out in accordance with the laws and regulations in force. The Client shall obtain the authorization of the

Users and rights holders of the scope targeted by the test. The conditions whereby the Client entrusts the

third party auditor with the performance of the Penetration Tests are the subject of a separate agreed

concluded between the Client and the auditor, and include all the conditions of this article. The Client

declares and guarantees to OVHcloud that all the conditions for conducting the Penetration Tests

stipulated herein will be respected, including by the auditor who acts under the full responsibility of the

Client.



Under no circumstances shall the Penetration Tests (a) target other OVHcloud target elements and

OVHcloud Infrastructures other than those used exclusively by the Client (including but not limited to

OVHcloud shared infrastructure, networks and services), (b) disrupt the proper functioning of the Services

and OVHcloud infrastructure and networks and/or (c) have any impact on the Services, resources,

networks and infrastructure provided by OVHcloud to other clients. Any attempt to intrude into

environments or systems used by other OVHcloud clients is expressly prohibited.



The Client is solely responsible for all consequences that may result from the performance of the

Penetration Tests, including when they are carried out by a third party auditor. In particular, it is the

Client's responsibility to carry out or to have carried out in advance, and under its entire responsibility,

all backups necessary to enable, in the event of an incident occurring during the Penetration Tests, to

restore and to be able to continue to use the target elements of the Penetration Tests (systems,

applications, data, etc.).

The Client is informed that if, within the framework of the Services, protection mechanisms, such as

systems to prevent the sending of fraudulent or massive mail (SPAM) or against computer attacks by

denial of service (DOS or DDOS), have been put in place, these mechanisms will not be deactivated within

the framework of the Penetration Tests, and may therefore result in the unavailability of the Services.

The Client is responsible for informing any person likely to be affected by such unavailability.



At the end of the Penetration Tests, a written audit report is drawn up. The audit report will be

communicated to OVHcloud upon first request or whenever it is of interest to OVHcloud (in particular in

the event of a flaw or vulnerability in OVHcloud's Services or Infrastructures, or that could impact other

OVHcloud clients).

The audit report, its contents, and more generally all information disclosed or collected in the course of

the audit and concerning, directly or indirectly, OVHcloud, are considered strictly confidential, and may

under no circumstances be published or disclosed to third parties without OVHcloud's prior written

consent.



In the event of non-compliance by the Client and/or the third party auditor with all or part of the terms

and conditions of this article, OVHcloud reserves the right to immediately suspend access to its Services,

without prejudice to any damages OVHcloud may claim.



4\. MEASURES FOR THE PREVENTION OF SPAMMING FROM OVH'S NETWORK



4.1. Measures of traffic monitoring. OVHcloud shall implement a system of technical measures intended to

prevent the dispatch of fraudulent emails and spam from its Infrastructure. OVHcloud shall monitor

outgoing traffic from the Service towards port 25 (SMTP server) on the Internet, which shall involve

monitoring traffic by means of automatic tools. The outgoing traffic referred in this paragraph shall be

monitored by OVHcloud with a delay of a few seconds, rather than being filtered or intercepted. These

operations shall be conducted by OVHcloud concurrently and not, under any circumstances directly

8/22



between the Services and the internet. OVHcloud shall not conduct any tagging of e-mails, and shall not

modify e-mails sent by the Client in anyway whatsoever. No information shall be stored by OVHcloud

during these operations aside from statistical data. The operation in this paragraph shall be conducted

regularly and in a fully-automated manner by OVHcloud and the Client acknowledges that no human

intervention is involved during the monitoring of traffic to port 25 (SMTP port).



4.2 Blocking e-mails identified as spam. In the case of outgoing traffic from the Client’s server, including e-

mails, being identified as spam or fraudulent e-mails, OVHcloud shall inform the Client by e-mail and

block the Server’s SMTP port.



4.3. Unblocking terms. The Client may request unblocking of the SMTP port through their Management

Interface. Any new e-mail identified as spam will entail a new blocking of the SMTP port by OVHcloud

for a longer period to be determined at OVH’s reasonable discretion. On the occurrence of OVHcloud’s

blocking the SMTP port for a third time, OVHcloud reserves the right to deny any new request for the

unblocking of the SMTP port.



4.4 Data. OVHcloud shall not keep any copy of e-mails sent from the Service's SMTP port, even when they

are identified as spam.



5\. MITIGATION (protection against DOS and DDoS attacks)



5.1 Protection Measures. OVHcloud shall implement protection against DOS and DDoS-type (Distributed

Denial of Service) hacking attempts provided that these attacks are conducted in a manner reasonably

considered to be serious enough by OVHcloud to justify such protection. In implementing such

protection, the OVHcloud shall use reasonable endeavors to ensure that the operation of the Client’s

Services is maintained throughout the duration of a DOS or DDoS attack. The function provided in this

article involves monitoring the traffic sent to the Client’s Services from outside OVHcloud’s network. The

traffic identified as illegitimate shall then be rejected by OVHcloud prior to reaching the Client’s

Infrastructure, thus allowing legitimate users to access the applications offered by the Client in spite of

the attack.



5.2. Scope of the protection. The protection measures outlined in this article shall not apply in the case of

attacks such as SQL injection, brute-force, abuse of security vulnerabilities, or attacks of a similar nature

to the latter. In such cases, the Infrastructures and the Service may be temporarily suspended and

unavailable. As a result of the high technicality of the Service, certain attacks may not be detected by the

protection measures implemented by OVHcloud. The protection measures outlined in Articles 6.1 and

6.2 shall not apply in the case of attacks such as SQL injection, brute-force, abuse of security

vulnerabilities, or attacks of a similar nature to the latter. In such cases, the Infrastructure and the Service

may be temporarily suspended and unavailable. Given the nature of a potential DOS or DDoS attack and

their complexity, OVHcloud shall implement different levels of traffic protection in order to preserve

their Infrastructure and the Services.



5.3. Detection of the attack. The mitigation of a DOS or DDoS attack is activated only at the time of the

detection of the attack by the OVHcloud's tools and for a non-fixed period, and deactivated only once

the attack and illegitimate traffic are no longer present. Thus, until the mitigation is activated, the Service

shall handle the attack directly, which may lead to the temporary unavailability of the Service. While

mitigation is activated, OVHcloud shall not guarantee the accessibility of the Client’s applications but it

shall endeavour to limit the impact of a DOS or DDOS attack on the Client’s Services and on OVHcloud’s

Infrastructure. If, in spite of the activation of mitigation, a DOS or DDOS attack is of such a nature as to

9/22



adversely affect the integrity of OVHcloud’s Infrastructure or the infrastructure of the other Clients of

OVHcloud, OVHcloud shall strengthen its protection measures which may lead to the deterioration of

the Client’s Services or impact its availability for which OVHcloud shall not be liable.



5.4. Client’s configuration. Where part of the traffic generated by a DOS or DDOS attack is not detected by

the OVHcloud’s equipment and reaches the Client’s Services, the effectiveness of the mitigation shall

also depend on the appropriate configuration of the Client’s Services. In this regard, the Client must

ensure that it has the adequate resources to administer the configuration of the Client’s Services

properly. The Client shall be solely responsible for ensuring it secures its Services, implementing security

tools (firewall, etc.), periodically updating their system, backing up their data and for ensuring the

security of their software (scripts, codes etc.).



6\. OVHcloud SUPPORT



6.1. OVHcloud Support team. The OVHcloud Support team is responsible for handling Incidents which may

occur in relation to the Services, and to provide the Client, upon request, with information regarding the

characteristics and Terms of Services. Provided the other levels of Support referred to in article 4.4

below, OVHcloud Support is available in French only and information regarding the

Services is available during business hours only. OVHcloud infrastructures are monitored 24/7, 365 days

a year. In order to ensure the continuity of such monitoring on a 24/7/365 basis, OVHcloud reserves the

right to subcontract part of the Support in accordance with the section “Subcontract”.



6.2. Recourse to OVHcloud Support. The Client may contact the OVHcloud Support by email, using a special

form available in the Management Interface, or by telephone by calling 1-855-684-5463\. Nevertheless,

during non-business hours, the OVHcloud Support team can only be reached by email or through the

Management Interface. OVHcloud shall create a ticket (“Incident Ticket”) for each request or Incident

report received. The Client will be informed of the creation of the Incident Ticket and its corresponding

number. The Client can access the history and status of its requests and Incidents reported through its

Management Interface. The Client undertakes not to make use of the OVHcloud Support wrongfully.

Before resorting to the OVHcloud Support, the Client must first consult the resources and information

available on the OVHcloud Website (user guides, use cases, product documentation, etc.), and in its

Management Interface (reporting, monitoring, etc.). The Client shall not (a) contact the OVHcloud

Support for services or products that it has not contracted from OVHcloud cloud directly or(ii) place the

OVHcloud Support teams in direct contact with its own clients or any other party external to the

Contract. OVHcloud reserves the right to refuse to accept any request which does not meet the

aforementioned conditions.

The Client undertakes to adopt behaviour that is appropriate, cordial and respectful in its interactions

with OVHcloud Support. OVHcloud reserves the right to no longer reply to the Client’s requests and to

immediately terminate the Contract in case of abusive, outrageous, or degrading behaviour.

Furthermore, such behaviour may result in legal action taken against the Client, for which purposes

OVHcloud may resort to any means of evidence which it deems useful and relevant (extracts of

communications with the Client, screenshots, emails, recording of telephone calls, etc.). Subject to the

other levels of Support referred to in article 4.4 below, OVHcloud Support is included in the price of the

Services.



6.3. Incident handling. In case of malfunction of the Services, the Client shall firstly perform the technical

tests recommended on the OVHcloud Website. In the event these tests do not resolve the Incident, the

Client may report the Incident to the OVHcloud Support as set out above and provide as much

information as possible to facilitate a proper diagnosis. When an Incident is reported, OVHcloud Support

10/22



shall carry out the necessary investigation to identify the cause of the observed malfunction and

establish a diagnosis. The Client agrees to remain available at all times in order to collaborate with

OVHcloud on a proper diagnosis and resolution of the Incident, in particular by providing OVHcloud with

any additional information, and by performing all of the necessary tests and verifications. Within the

scope of Incident handling, OVHcloud and its Partner Companies are expressly authorized by the Client

to connect to the Client Services at both the hardware and software levels, in order to take any action

that is necessary to perform a diagnosis. This connection may require the Client to perform an action on

its Service. OVHcloud shall keep the Client reasonably wellinformed of the progress of the operations. If

OVHcloud establishes that its Services are available and functioning properly, or that the existence of

the Incident cannot be confirmed, or that the Incident does not fall under the responsibility of OVHcloud,

OVHcloud shall inform the Client accordingly. In this case, the time spent by OVHcloud on performing

the diagnosis and assisting the Client may be charged to the Client as an additional service provided,

based on the fee schedule available on the OVHcloud Website or provided to the Client. OVHcloud

reserves the right to refuse any assistance if it ascertains, during its investigation, that the Client is using

the Service in violation of the Contract or of any applicable law or regulation. If the Incident appears to

fall under OVHcloud’s responsibility, OVHcloud shall finish the diagnosis and work to re-establish the

availability of the impacted Services. In this case, the work performed by OVHcloud shall not result in

any additional charges. The diagnosis shall be established by OVHcloud using any means necessary, and

particularly based on exchanges between the Parties and data from the OVHcloud information system

(such as

login data) which the Client hereby expressly agrees may be admissible and fully enforceable. Subject to

any applicable Specific Terms of Service and other levels of Support referred to in article 4.4 below,

OVHcloud does not provide any warranty as to the duration of repairs or time frames for the resolution

8\. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS



8.1. Price of Services. The prices of the Services invoiced to the Client are those in effect at the time of

invoicing, as published on the OVHcloud Website. The prices may also be communicated upon request

sent to OVHcloud Support. Unless stipulated otherwise, all prices are in US dollars. OVHcloud offers

different types of rates depending on the type of Service (monthly flat-rate, yearly flat-rate, per use

pricing, etc.). These rates may be linked to a commitment to a particular period of use and/or a specific

method of invoicing. Should several types of prices be available for the same Service, the Client may

select the one of its choosing when submitting its Order. All taxes applicable to the Services (excluding

13/22



taxes on OVHcloud revenue) shall be added to the price of the Services and due by the Client without

this being deemed a change in the price as envisaged by article 6.2 of this Contract. In the absence of a

special pricing scheme, the prices of the Services shall include the cost of acquisition of the licenses and

rights to use the tools, software and Operating Systems used by OVHcloud and/or which are made

available to the Client by OVHcloud within the scope of the Services. The Client is responsible for

acquiring and fulfilling its obligations in respect of all licenses and usage rights that are necessary to

operate or make use of the Content within the scope of the Services. The methods for calculating the

price of the Services, as well as the billing units, are defined on the OVHcloud Website and in the

applicable Specific Terms of Service. The Client is responsible for taking note of this before submitting

its order. Each billing unit begun shall be invoiced and due in full, even when it is not totally used. Some

Services shall incur additional installation or commissioning costs.



8.2. Changes to prices. OVHcloud reserves the right to change its prices at any time. Pricing changes are

immediately applicable to any new Orders. For Services in use at the time of an increase in their price,

the Client shall be informed of the change by email at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance. In such

a case and subject to article “Conditions Specific to Consumers” the Client has the right to terminate

without penalty the impacted Services within seven (7) calendar days upon the notification of the said

price increase. Such termination shall be notified by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt

or through a specific form provided in the Management Interface. In the absence of said termination,

the Client shall be deemed to have accepted the new prices. The aforementioned termination right is

not applicable in case of price increase due to unpredictable circumstances making the execution

excessively expensive for OVHcloud, which had not agreed to assume the risk.



8.3. Invoicing. The Services shall be invoiced on the basis of Client Orders and consumption of Services as

established by OVHcloud in its information system, which shall be deemed as admissible and fully

enforceable to the Client. The periodicity (monthly, yearly, or other) of invoices and the timing of their

issuance (upon ordering or in arrears) varies from one Service to another. The terms of invoicing of the

prices of the Services are defined on the OVHcloud Website and in the applicable Specific Terms of

Service. The Client is responsible for taking note of these before submitting its Order. After each

payment, OVHcloud shall send the Client an invoice. The Client expressly agrees that this invoice shall

be sent to it electronically. The invoice is sent to the Client by email and/or made available to the Client

through the Management Interface. The Client is responsible for keeping a copy of the invoice in

accordance with regulations in effect. Invoices made available to the Client in the Management

Interface shall remain available for a period of twelve (12) months following the date made available.



8.4. Payment. Invoices are payable on receipt, it being understood that invoices are issued either at the time

the end of a calendar month in the event that the total Services consumed by the Client during the

month in question reach a significant amount. The Client is fully responsible for payment of Services in

accordance with the article “Financial Conditions”. The Client undertakes to select a valid payment

method in its Client Account, and to dispose of the necessary funds to render payment for the Services.

Provided the cancellation right of article “Conditions Specific to Consumers”, the Client remains liable

to settle the price in its entirety. Consequently, (i) the Client shall have no claim to any reimbursement

resulting from the non-use, the partial-use, suspension or cessation of the use of Services before the

end of the Period of Use and (2) in the event of split payment(s) (e.g. monthly, yearly installments), the

Client remains liable to settle the price in its entirety for the whole of the commitment period

14/22



subscribed to at the time of the Order. Those provisions is without prejudice to the Client’s right to

engage OVHcloud’s liability in accordance with article “Liability” hereafter in case such situation results

from OVHcloud’s failure to fulfil its obligations.



8.5. Default or late payment. In case of default or late payment, including partial payment, OVHcloud may

charge the Client late payment penalties equal to 2% calculated monthly (26.82% per year) from the

day following the payment due date and OVHcloud. Furthermore, any default or delay of payment

(including partial) of the sums due by the Client under the Contract which persists for more than (4)

days after notification of default or delay of payment sent to the Client by email, shall result by right,

and without requiring any additional notification or formal notice, in (a) the immediate demand of all

of the sums remaining due by the Client under the Contract regardless of their payment terms, and (b)

the right of OVHcloud to decide to immediately suspend and without prior notice all or part of the Client

Services (including those which have been paid for), to refuse any new Order or renewal

of Services to the Client and to terminate all or part of the Contract . In case of default or late payment,

business Clients shall be liable to pay a fixed recovery fee of sixty (60) US dollars, without prejudice to

OVH’s right to demand, upon supporting documents, additional compensation in cases where the

recovery fees are greater than the amount of said fixed recovery fee.



8.6. Contestation. In the event of any disagreement regarding invoicing or the nature of the Services, the

Client must notify OVHcloud Support through its Management Interface within one (1) month of the

date the invoice was issued. In the absence of said notification, and without prejudice to the Client’s

right to contest the invoice later on, the Client shall be liable to settle all unpaid invoices according to

the terms of the Contract. In case of failure to invoice the Services correctly or in the appropriate

timeframe, OVHcloud reserves the right invoice or correct the invoicing at any time, subject to any

mandatory applicable limitation.



9\. DURATION, RENEWAL AND TERMINATION OF SERVICES



9.1. Duration of Services. The Contract is entered into for an indeterminate period of time and remains in

effect so long as the Client uses the OVHcloud Services. The duration for which the Client undertakes

its Order (the “Period of Use”). In case of flat-rate or fixed sum payments (monthly, annual or other),

and subject to Article “Conditions Specific to Consumers” and section “Termination for breach”, the

Client undertakes to use the Services during the entire corresponding period. In case of payment per

use, the Services are made available for an indeterminate period of time, and the Client may terminate

its use of the Services at any time in accordance with the procedures in effect.



9.2. Renewal of Services. The terms for the renewal of Services vary from one type of Service to another, as

set out in the Specific Terms applicable to such Services. Some of these renewed automatically (“Auto-

Renew”) while others are renewed upon payment in advance by the Client. In cases where multiple

options exist, the Client is responsible for selecting the renewal method of its choosing and the initial

commitment period. For certain Services, the Auto-Renew mode is activated by default. Requests for

reissued payment are automatically rejected in case of default in payment or irregular payment

(incorrect amount, incomplete payment, payment which does not include the required references, or

issued using a method or procedure not accepted by OVHcloud). In case of payment reissued by cheque,

the Client is responsible to reissue payment early enough for the cheque to be effectively received by

OVHcloud before the expiry date of the Services. OVHcloud reserves the right to terminate the renewal,

notably, with a reasonable prior notice, in case of a Service’s disappearance.

15/22



9.3. Termination for breach. Without prejudice to the other cases of termination provided in the Contract,

and without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either Party may terminate this Contract

or (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of seven (7) calendar days

after being notified by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt to do so. Notwithstanding

the rights of a third party, OVHcloud shall be entitled to terminate the relevant Services or the Contract

in its entirety with immediate effect by email and without prior formal notice. The present paragraph

shall not be considered to be a waiver of OVHcloud’s right to suspend or interrupt the Services in

case of non-compliance by the Client with the Terms of Service. Terminations for breach are without

prejudice to any damages which may be claimed by the injured party.
