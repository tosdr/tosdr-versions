Security Of Data

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Breach Response Plan

In the event that Student Data is accessed or obtained by an unauthorized individual, MyBib (“Provider”) shall provide notification to the school or district (“Subscriber”) within forty-eight (48) hours. Provider shall email a Notice of Data Breach (“Notice”) to account contacts on record that details what happened, what Student Data was involved, and what is being done to resolve the issue. Subscriber will be given Provider email and phone contact information to obtain more information.

The Notice will specifically include:

* A description of the breach in plain language.
* Specific Student Data that MyBib believes to have been compromised.
* Estimated date or date range the breach occurred.
* A description of what MyBib has done to protect against further data breach.
* Advice to individuals whose information has been breached.
* MyBib contact information to obtain further details.

Provider agrees to adhere to all requirements in applicable State and federal law with respect to a data breach related to the Student Data, including, when appropriate or required, the required responsibilities and procedures for notification and mitigation of any such data breach.

Provider maintains and keeps updated a written incident response plan that reflects best practices and is consistent with industry standards and federal and state law for responding to a data breach, breach of security, privacy incident or unauthorized acquisition or use of Student Data or any portion thereof, including personally identifiable information.

Removal Of Data
---------------

You may request the complete deletion of your data at any time by emailing support@mybib.com from the email address you used to register on MyBib. Your parents may also review and request deletion of any of your data on your behalf by emailing support@mybib.com.

Analytics
---------

We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.

* **Google Analytics**
    
    Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of MyBib. This data is shared with other Google services.
    
    You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
    
    For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: [https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)
    

Links To Other Sites
--------------------

MyBib may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

FERPA compliance
----------------

We know that certain information about your students will be contained in records maintained by MyBib and that this information may be considered confidential by reason of the Family and Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S. C. 1232g) (FERPA) unless valid consent is obtained from your students or their legal guardians. Accordingly, MyBib uses all commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical standards to ensure that no unauthorized person gains access to any student information that may be considered confidential under FERPA. We also use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that we do not inadvertently disclose any student information that may be considered confidential under FERPA to anyone other than personnel within your institution or other individuals that have been authorized by your institution to access such information through the use of our system, persons or organizations providing the student with financial aid, authorized representatives of federal or state governments for the audit and evaluation of federal and state supported programs or other persons as required by law.

GDPR compliance
---------------

MyBib is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the GDPR.

Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be:

1. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;
2. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;
3. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;
4. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;
5. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and
6. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
