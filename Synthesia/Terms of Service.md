Terms of Service
================

_Published on July 20th, 2022_

**1\. Introduction**
--------------------

Welcome to Synthesia’s Platform! As you have just arrived at our Terms of Service, please pause, grab a cup of coffee, and carefully read the following pages. It will take you approximately 20 minutes.

“**Synthesia**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**” is Synthesia Limited along with Synthesia’s subsidiaries and affiliates, their respective directors, officers, employees, licensees, contractors, attorneys, agents, successors, and assigns.

“**User**”, “**you**” or “**your**” is either: i) a registered business that visits our website or uses any product or service made available through the Platform including the business’ respective directors, officers, employees, licensees, contractors, attorneys, agents, successors and assigns (“**Business Customer**”); or ii) a private individual that visits our website or uses any products or service made available through the Platform (“**Consumer**”).

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your use of our web pages located at synthesia.io (the “**Site**”), services and products accessible through the Site (“**Services**”) and the associated web-based software provided by Synthesia (“**Software**”). The Site, the Services, and the Software are jointly referred to as the “**Platform**”.  Our Privacy Policy, available at [https://www.synthesia.io/terms/privacy-policy](https://www.synthesia.io/terms/privacy-policy), explains how we collect, safeguard, and disclose information that results from your use of the Platform.

If you are using the Platform as a Business Customer, our processing of personal data you provide us during your use of the Platform is further regulated by our Data Processing Agreement (“**DPA**”) available here https://www.synthesia.io/terms/data-processing-agreement. The DPA represents an integral part of the Terms for Business Customers. If you are using the Platform as a private individual the DPA does not apply. 

By accessing and using the Platform you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Terms, our Privacy Policy, and where applicable the DPA, and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) the above, then you may not use (and must immediately stop using) the Platform, but please let us know by emailing at support@synthesia.io so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, Users and others who wish to access or use the Platform.

Thank you for being responsible.

#### **‍**

**2\. No Use By Minors**
------------------------

The Platform is intended only for access and use by individuals at least sixteen (16) years old. 

By accessing or using the Platform, you warrant and represent that you are at least sixteen (16) years of age and with the full authority, right, and capacity to enter into this agreement and abide by all of the terms and conditions of these Terms. If you are not at least sixteen (16) years old, you are prohibited from both the access and usage of the Platform and should immediately stop using the Platform.

#### **‍**

**3\. Communications**
----------------------

If you register on the Platform we will use your email address to send you important Service emails including password resets, purchase confirmations, data breach warnings, as well as marketing emails with information about the Services including information on how to create content, introduction of new functionalities and promotions. You may opt-out of the marketing emails by accessing your account settings on the Platform or by following the unsubscribe link in the emails you receive. We will not send you marketing emails about any third-party product or service without obtaining your explicit prior consent. 

For additional information about how we protect your privacy, please refer to our Privacy Policy at [https://www.synthesia.io/terms/privacy-policy](https://www.synthesia.io/terms/privacy-policy).

#### **‍**

**4\. Purchases**
-----------------

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Platform (“**Purchase**”), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your billing address.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete.

We may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your payment information, you understand that we may share that information with these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

Your Purchase is not confirmed until you receive a confirmation email from us. In particular, we reserve the right to reject your Purchase due to product or service unavailability, or if fraud or an unauthorised or illegal transaction is suspected.

All prices shown on the Platform are as a standard denominated in USD. We may determine to show the prices in the currency that Synthesia determines to be your local currency. All prices shown to Consumers include applicable sales taxes at the rate that is in force from time to time.

#### **‍**

**5\. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions**
--------------------------------------------

Any contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions (collectively, “**Promotions**”) made available through the Platform may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms, the rules governing the Promotion will prevail.

#### **‍**

**6\. Subscriptions**
---------------------

Some Services are subject to payments. Paid Services are usually provided on a recurring subscription basis (“**Subscription(s)**”), but we may also provide them on a fixed-term basis (“**Fixed Term**”), or as one-time payment add-ons (“**Add-on(s)**”). Fixed Term Services are paid against the invoice according to the payment terms agreed separately. Unless otherwise agreed, Subscription payment terms shall not apply to Fixed Term Services. If you are interested in Fixed Term Services, please contact us. Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“**Billing Cycle**”). The relevant Billing Cycle will be displayed to you at check-out.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it or Synthesia cancels it. If your Subscription is on an annual basis, we will let you know at least fifteen (15) days in advance of any automatic renewal in order to give you the opportunity to cancel your Subscription. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription and Add-on(s). You shall provide Synthesia with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, VAT number (if applicable) and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorise Synthesia to charge all Subscription and Add-on fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Synthesia may (but does not have an obligation to) issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice. We reserve the right to terminate your Subscription in the event we are unable to collect a relevant payment from you (whether automatically or manually). Where that happens, we will inform you of the termination of your Subscription via email.

#### **‍**

**7\. Free Trial**
------------------

We may, at our sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“**Free Trial**”).

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for a Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by Synthesia until your Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time before the start of your Free Trial and without notice, Synthesia reserves the right to (i) modify the terms applicable to any Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

#### **‍**

**8\. Fee Changes**
-------------------

Synthesia, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. We will inform you of any change to your Subscription fees at least thirty (30) days in advance to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Any Subscription fee change will become effective immediately upon publishing, or, if you have an active Subscription, at the end of your then current Billing Cycle.

Your continued use of a Subscription after a Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the revised Subscription fee amount.

#### **‍**

**9\. Refunds**
---------------

If you make any Purchase on the Platform as a Consumer, you have the right to request a refund of the applicable Purchase price without providing a reason at any time within fifteen (15) days of the original date of purchase. As your Purchase can be used by you immediately, we reserve the right to only issue a pro-rated refund which reflects the amount of time you have enjoyed the Purchase before claiming a refund.

To request a refund (or partial refund), please contact us by using the contact details at the bottom of these Terms. We will issue any refund as soon as possible to the payment method used for the original Purchase.

Refunds do not apply to Business Customers.

#### **‍**

**10\. Software license and Content**
-------------------------------------

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, and during your active Subscription, Synthesia grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Software. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you may not: 

• decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, or decrypt the Software; 

• make any modification, adaptation, improvement, enhancement, translation, or derivative work from the Software;

• violate any applicable laws, rules, or regulations in connection with your access or use of the Software;

• remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notice (including any notice of copyright or trademark) posted by Synthesia or the licensors of the Software;

• use the Software for any purpose for which it is not designed or intended; 

• use the Software for creating a product, service, or software that is, directly or indirectly, competitive with or in any way a substitute for the Software; or

• distribute, transfer, sublicence, lease, lend or rent the Software to any third-party; 

Our Platform allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (referred to as “**Your Content**”), and also allows you to create or generate graphics, videos or other material (referred to as “**User Generated Content**”). 

You are responsible for Your Content and User Generated Content, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting or creating content on or through the Platform, you represent and warrant that: (i) Your Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and licence as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of Your Content on or through the Platform does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate your account in the event you infringe this provision.

You retain any and all of your rights to any content you submit, post, display or create on or through the Platform and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for content you post or create on or through the Platform. 

For the purposes of these Terms “**Synthesia Content**” refers to all images, text, audio, video data, or any other information located on the Platform or available through the Platform. Synthesia Content is and will remain the exclusive property of Synthesia and its licensors. Immediately upon creating the User Generated Content Synthesia grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable licence to use Synthesia Content in the created User Generated Content. Granted licence is limited by the Acceptable Use Policy requirements and conditioned on the full payment of the applicable Subscription fees. The licence may be revoked only due to the breach of the Acceptable Use Policy. Revoking the licence for the use in User Generated Content that is found in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy will not affect the licence for the non-breaching User Generated Content.

Certain parts of the Synthesia Content are owned or created by third parties and licenced or transferred through Synthesia. For example, background images for enterprise accounts are provided by Shutterstock (https://www.shutterstock.com/licence), and they do not include content designated by Shutterstock as “editorial use only”; audio files created through text-to-speech functionality are provided by various integrated text-to-speech services that either grant Synthesia the sole ownership or an exclusive, sublicensable licence. Licence or ownership granted by third parties to Synthesia will not restrict the licences provided herein. Synthesia shall only offer the third-party content that can be licenced to you entirely in accordance with the licence terms specified herein.

Synthesia has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all content submitted by users on the Platform. 

By uploading or creating content on or through the Platform, you grant Synthesia a free of charge, non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide licence to: (i) deliver the Platform to you; and (ii) use the content for internal research and development and/or to improve the Platform and any other Synthesia technology. Where content includes personal information about private individuals this will be further regulated by our Privacy Policy, DPA, or other individual agreement. 

You shall ensure that Your Content complies with, and assist Synthesia to comply with, the requirements of all legislation and regulatory requirements in force from time to time relating to the use of personal data included in Your Content, including (without limitation) any data protection legislation from time to time in force in the UK including the Data Protection Act 2018 and any successor legislation. You will collect and process the personal data of all individuals featured in the content in accordance with all applicable laws, including by obtaining any appropriate consents or approvals sufficient for the provision of the Platform by Synthesia.

You are solely responsible for securing and backing up Your Content.

#### **‍**

**11\. Prohibited Uses – Acceptable Use Policy**
------------------------------------------------

You agree that you will not misuse the Platform, Synthesia Content, Your Content or User Generated Content. A misuse constitutes any use, access, or interference with the Platform, Synthesia Content, Your Content or User Generated Content contrary to these Terms, any other individual agreement executed between you and Synthesia, and applicable laws and regulations. You will especially not, without limitation, use the Platform, Synthesia Content, Your Content or User Generated Content:

8. Take any action that may damage or falsify Synthesia's ratings or reputation.

The avatars that are not created specifically for you and are already available in the Platform (**Stock Avatars**) are made based on and bear a life-like resemblance to real people. For this reason, in order to comply with the licensing terms with the actors and to protect the rights and reputation of the actors, additional restrictions apply. In addition to general restrictions, you agree not to use any Stock Avatars (without Synthesia's explicit written consent):

1. In User Generated Content for TV broadcasting.
2. In User Generated Content for "promoted", "boosted", or "paid" advertising on any social media platform or similar media.
3. In User Generated Content used as or part of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or similar.
4. To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material, including any "junk mail", “chain letter”, “spam”, or any other similar solicitation.
5. To portray Stock Avatar in User Generated Content in a way that a person would reasonably find offensive, including, but not limited to portraying Stock Avatar as suffering from or medicating for any medical condition, including addiction.

To portray Stock Avatar in User Generated Content alongside or in connection with regulated or not age-appropriate goods or services including, but not limited to alcohol, tobacco, nicotine (including vaping products), psychoactive substances, firearms, gambling, contraceptives, sex toys, escort services, dating services, adult entertainment venues and similar.
7. In User Generated Content in which Stock Avatar is making any kind of statement of opinion, including expressing any personal preferences or experiences as if they are Stock Avatar’s preferences or experiences.
8. In User Generated Content in which Stock Avatar is making any kind of statement of fact regarding religion, politics, race, gender, sexuality, or other similar topics that are known to be sensitive to certain demographics.
9. To create trademarks, design-marks, service-marks, or other similar protected or registrable rights.

Synthesia may, but is not obliged to, monitor User Generated Content for breach of the Acceptable Use Policy. If User Generated Content is automatically flagged for a possible violation of the Acceptable Use Policy, such request for content creation may undergo a manual review or become automatically rejected. Synthesia can in its full discretion decide if User Generated Content violates this Acceptable Use Policy and reject User Generated Content creation request. If any of User Generated Content is deemed in violation of this Acceptable Use Policy after its creation, you must immediately delete, stop distributing and recall the violating Content both online and offline. We may immediately discontinue your access to the Platform in the event of breach of the Acceptable Use Policy.
