but for such use, (d) based on Customer’s use of a superseded or altered release of any code, document, service, product, or deliverable

after Boomi has recommended discontinuation, if the infringement would have been avoided by use of a current or unaltered release

made available to Customer, (e) if Customer is in material breach of this Agreement, or (f) based on any Boomi modifications made

pursuant to instructions, designs, specifications or any other information provided by or on behalf of Customer, if any.

associated with performance of this contract, beyond the amounts and theories of liabilities permitted if asserted against Boomi itself.

11. Confidential Information.

11.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means information or materials disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other

party (the “Receiving Party”) that are not generally available to the public and which, due to their character and nature, a reasonable

person under like circumstances would treat as confidential, including without limitation, financial, marketing and pricing information, trade

secrets, know-how, proprietary tools, knowledge and methodologies, the Boomi Services, the Software (in source code and/or object

code form), information or benchmark test results regarding the functionality and performance of the Software, any Software license keys

provided to Customer and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

11.2 This Agreement imposes no obligation upon a Receiving Party with respect to information designated as confidential which: (a)

the Receiving Party can demonstrate was already in its possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party; (b) is or becomes publicly

available through no fault of the Receiving Party or its Representatives (defined below); (c) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party

11.3 Obligations: Recipient will use Confidential Information only for the purpose of and in connection with the evaluation of a

potential, or continuation of, a business transaction or relationship between the parties. If a Recipient is required by a government body

or court of law to disclose Confidential Information, to the extent permitted by law, the recipient agrees to give the discloser reasonable

notice so that the discloser may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its

directors, officers, employees and employees of its Affiliates, as well as its and its Affiliates’ contractors, advisors and agents, so long as

those individuals have a need to know in their work for recipient in furtherance of the potential or continued business transaction or

relationship and are bound by obligations of confidentiality at least as restrictive as those imposed on recipient in this Agreement

(collectively, “Representatives”). Recipient will use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, as the recipient uses with

respect to its own similar information to protect the Confidential Information. Recipient may only disclose Confidential Information as

authorized herein. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, a recipient's duty to protect Confidential Information expires 3 years from

the date of disclosure. Upon the discloser's written request, recipient will promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information received

from the discloser, together with all copies. Notwithstanding the above, recipient’s professional advisors (e.g., lawyers and accountants)

may retain in confidence one file copy of their respective work papers and final reports in accordance with their professional and ethical

obligations. The Receiving Party will be liable to the Disclosing Party for the acts or omissions of any Representatives to which it discloses

Confidential Information which, if done by the Receiving Party, would breach this Agreement.

12. Personal Data.

12.1 Definitions. For purposes of this section, “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural

person that Customer submits to the Boomi Services during this Agreement or which is received, accessed and/or processed by Boomi

in the capacity of “processor” acting on behalf of Customer, as “controller”, in connection with the performance of the Boomi Services

under this Agreement. “Privacy Laws” means any applicable law regarding privacy, data protection and/or the processing of Personal

Data to which Boomi and/or the Customer are subject and which is applicable to the parties’ data protection obligations under this

Agreement, including if applicable the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

12.2 Instructions. Customer (a) represents that it has the right to transfer the Personal Data to Boomi, and (b) instructs Boomi to

process the Personal Data for the purposes of performing its obligations and complying with its rights under this Agreement and any

applicable Orders. Boomi will process the Personal Data only in accordance with Customer’s instructions detailed in this section 12 and

Customer’s configurations and administrative settings, which shall comprise Customer’s complete instructions regarding the processing

of the Personal Data. Customer retains responsibility for all data that Customer runs through the Boomi Services, and is responsible for

complying with applicable Privacy Law regarding the lawfulness of the processing of Personal Data prior to disclosing, transferring,

transmitted through or otherwise making available, any Personal Data to Boomi and its Subprocessors (including, obtaining any needed

consents). Boomi will have no liability to Customer for any breach of this Agreement resulting from Boomi’s compliance with Customer’s

system configurations or instructions.

12.3 Customer acknowledges that Boomi Services generally include a number of controls including security features and functionality

such as purge data settings, user role settings and support access settings. Customer is responsible for reviewing the default settings

and onboarding materials, and for properly configuring the Boomi Services to fit Customer’s security and operational needs. Should the

Boomi Services be configured to move data from one point to another, Customer is responsible for ensuring that Customer is rightfully

integrating among connected systems, whether Customer transmits data outside of a particular cloud or system, outside of a particular

geography or otherwise. Default configurations may not be optimized to process, store or transmit personally identifiable information that

is subject to heightened security requirements as a result of Customer’s internal policies or practices or by law. Customer is solely

responsible for compliance with heightened security requirements mandated by its own internal policies and by law.

12.4 Compliance. Each party will comply with their respective obligations under the Privacy Laws in relation to the processing of

Personal Data under this Agreement. Except as permitted herein or to the extent required by Privacy Laws or legal process, Boomi will

implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. This will include

prevention of unauthorized disclosure of or access to Personal Data by third parties, and will only store and process Personal Data as

required to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and any applicable SO’s or Orders and/or as required by the Privacy Laws. Boomi

will notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any disclosure of or access to the Personal Data by a third party in

breach of this section and will reasonably cooperate with Customer to reasonably remediate the effects of such disclosure or access.

Customer’s exclusive remedy and Boomi’s sole obligation for any breach of this section will be for Boomi to pay or reimburse Customer

for the reasonable costs of notification, credit monitoring and call center support, each to the extent made necessary by the breach and

required by applicable law.

12.5 International Transfers \& Subprocessors. Customer authorizes Boomi, in connection with the provision of the services provided

by Boomi, or in the normal course of business, and by means of general consent to (i), appoint and use Subprocessors (meaning any

processor engaged by Boomi, who agree to receive from Boomi, or from another Boomi Subprocessor, Personal Data intended for

processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the Customer under the terms of this Agreement and the written subcontract) and (ii)

MSA October 1, 2021 Page 5 of 6 Confidential



make worldwide transfers of Personal Data to its “Subprocessors”. Boomi will ensure appropriate agreements are in place with such

Subprocessors to seek to safeguard the Personal Data transferred under or in connection with this Agreement, and which impose

appropriate obligations that are (a) relevant to the services to be provided by that Subprocessor and (b) materially equivalent to the

obligations imposed on Boomi under this section 12. Where the provision of services by Boomi involves the transfer of Personal Data

from the EEA to countries outside the EEA (which are not subject to an adequacy decision under Privacy Laws), Boomi affirms to Customer

that it has adequate agreements in place (both intra-group agreements with any Affiliates as well as with its Subprocessors with access

to the Personal Data) incorporating the Standard Contractual Clauses. Customer agrees that Personal Data may be sent to

Subprocessors, which may include third parties or any Boomi Affiliate. Boomi will provide a list of Subprocessors upon Customer’s written

request, the current list of which is at https://boomi.com/legal/sub-processors/.

13. Conduct. Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to discover or modify in any way the

underlying source code of the Software, or any part thereof unless and to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law.

Customer may not: (a) modify, translate, localize, adapt, rent, lease, loan, create or prepare derivative works of, or create a patent based

on the Boomi Services or any part thereof; (b) resell, provide, make available to or permit use of or access to the Boomi Service or

associated access credentials, in whole or in part, by any third party; (c) use the Boomi Services to create or enhance a competitive

offering or for any purpose which is competitive to Boomi; or (d) perform or fail to perform any other act which would result in a

misappropriation or infringement of Boomi’s intellectual property rights in the Boomi Services. Each permitted copy of the Software made

by Customer hereunder must contain all titles, trademarks, copyrights and restricted rights notices as in the original. In connection with

the use of Boomi Services, Customer may not: (a) attempt to use or gain unauthorized access to Boomi’s or to any third party's networks

or equipment; (b) attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Boomi Services, or a system, account or network of Boomi or any

Boomi customers or suppliers; (c) engage in fraudulent, offensive or illegal activity or intentionally engage in any activity that infringes the

intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any individual or third party or transmit through the Boomi Service any data or information

without the legal right to do so; (d) transmit unsolicited bulk or commercial messages or intentionally distribute worms, Trojan horses,

viruses, corrupted files or any similar items; (e) restrict, inhibit, interfere or attempt to interfere with the ability of any other person,

regardless of purpose or intent, to use or enjoy the Boomi Services or a user’s network, or cause a performance degradation to any

facilities used to provide the Boomi Services. If Customer requests any managed services from Boomi, Customer will not cause Boomi to

use anything for which Boomi would need to obtain a license from such third party to provide those services. Customer will obtain all

necessary rights, permissions and consents associated with technology or data that Customer provides to Boomi, or with third party

software or other items that Customer requests that Boomi work with, install, or integrate to or from. Customer will cooperate with Boomi’s

reasonable investigation of Boomi Services outages, security issues and any suspected breach of this section, and shall, at its expense,

defend Boomi and its Affiliates from any claim, suit or action by a third party (a “Third Party Claim”) alleging harm caused by Customer’s

breach of this section. Customer shall pay any judgments or settlements reached in connection with the Third Party Claim and Boomi’s

costs of responding to it.

14. Boomi Flow Terms. If Customer uses a Boomi Service in connection with creation and hosting of external-facing websites,

Customer will comply with applicable law in any use of cookies or other tracking technologies on such websites. If Boomi is required to

take any action because of Customer or its Third Party Users violating applicable law or third party rights, Customer will fully cooperate

with any legal duties or related instructions of Boomi and will promptly remove any illegal or offensive content from Customer systems.

Boomi may also disable the applicable content, or the Boomi Flow service (howsoever named) or any application interacting therewith,

until the potential violation is resolved. A "Non-Boomi Flow Application" means a web-based or offline software application that is provided

by Customer or a third party and interoperates with the Boomi Flow service sold hereunder, including, for example, an application that is

developed by or for Customer or is listed on a Marketplace, i.e., an online directory, catalog or marketplace of applications that interoperate

with the Boomi Flow Services. Any acquisition by Customer of a Non-Boomi Flow Application, and any exchange of data between

Customer and any non-Boomi Flow provider, is solely between Customer and the applicable non-Boomi Flow provider. Boomi does not

warrant or support Non-Boomi Flow Applications, nor is it responsible for any results or effects of Customer’s use of such applications. If

Customer installs or enables a Non-Boomi Flow Application for use with a Boomi Flow Service, Customer grants Boomi permission to

allow the provider of that Non-Boomi Flow Application to access Customer data as required for the interoperation of that Non-Boomi Flow

Application with the Boomi Flow Service. Boomi Flow Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Non-Boomi Flow

Applications, for which Customer may be required to grant Boomi access. If the provider of a Non-Boomi Flow Application ceases to make

the Non-Boomi Flow Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Boomi Flow Service features on terms acceptable to

Boomi, Boomi may cease providing those features without entitling Customer to any refund, credit or other compensation.

extent permitted by law, the state and federal courts located in Texas will have exclusive jurisdiction for any Disputes. The parties agree

to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Travis or Williamson County, Texas, and agree to waive

all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by those courts and to venue in those courts. As a condition precedent to filing

any lawsuit, the parties will attempt to resolve any Dispute through negotiation with persons fully authorized to resolve the Dispute, or

through mediation utilizing a mutually agreeable mediator, rather than through litigation. Although the merits of the underlying Dispute will

be resolved in accordance with this Section, any party has the right to seek to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction a temporary

restraining order, preliminary injunction or other equitable relief to preserve the status quo, prevent irreparable harm, avoid the expiration

of any applicable limitation periods or preserve a superior position with respect to other creditors. If the parties are unable to resolve the

Dispute within 30 days (or other mutually agreed time) of notice of the Dispute to the other party, the parties will be free to pursue all

remedies available at law or in equity. European Economic Area: For Orders placed in the European Economic Area, this Agreement

will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles

that would require the application of laws of a different state or country and any action seeking enforcement of this Agreement or any

provision hereof will be brought exclusively in the courts located in London, England. Asia Pacific: For Orders placed in the Asia Pacific

region, law and venue will default to Australian law and venue in the State of New South Wales, Australia. Each party hereby agrees to

submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.

Each party acknowledges that in entering into the Agreement it has not relied on and will have no right or remedy in respect of, any

statement, representation, assurance or warranty other than as expressly set out in the Agreement. In those jurisdictions where an original

(non-faxed, non-electronic or non-scanned) copy of an agreement or an original (non-electronic) signature on agreements is required by

law or regulation, the parties agree that, notwithstanding any such law or regulation, a faxed, electronic or scanned copy of and a certified

electronic signature on this Agreement or any Order or Service Order will be sufficient to create an enforceable and valid agreement. The

terms of this Agreement will control over any conflicting terms and conditions contained in an Order or Service Order, except where this

Agreement specifically allows for an Order or Service Order to supersede. Neither this Agreement, nor an Order or Service Order, may

be modified or amended except by a writing executed by a duly authorized representative of each party.
