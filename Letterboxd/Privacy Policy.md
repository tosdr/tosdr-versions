Privacy policy
==============

1. **Your privacy**: Letterboxd is committed to ensuring the privacy of your information.
2. **Application**: This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information submitted by you on _letterboxd.com_ (the “Website”), or via an official Letterboxd app (the “App”), or via use of the Letterboxd API (the “API”), and any information that may be automatically retrieved through your use of these channels.
3. **Consent**: By accepting our [Terms of Use](https://letterboxd.com/legal/terms-of-use/) and this Privacy Policy when you create a Letterboxd account, and by accessing and using the Website, App or API, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, storage and processing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
4. **Changes to Privacy Policy**: We may amend or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, with or without notice to you. You agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy that is in effect at the time you access and use the Website, App or API.
5. **Personal information**: In order to use particular services that we offer, you may need to submit certain personal information such as your email address, name, address, telephone number, gender and date of birth. You may be asked to submit further information from time to time. If you purchase a subscription via Paddle, we may send identifying information to Paddle in order to link your subscription to your account. If you connect your Facebook or X/Twitter accounts to your Letterboxd account, we will access these accounts to identify which of your friends on those services also use Letterboxd.
6. **Cookies**: A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to keep you signed in, to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security and personalized content. Our service also uses cookies and similar tracking technologies such as the Common ID cookie to provide its services. Cookies are important devices for measuring advertising effectiveness and ensuring a robust online advertising industry. The Common ID cookie stores a unique ID in the first-party domain that is accessible to our ad partners. This ID can be utilized to improve user matching, especially when delivering ads to iOS and macOS browsers. Users may [opt out](#opt-out) of Common ID tracking.
7. **Advertising privacy**: _(applies to non-paying members and casual visitors only)_ When you use our website, pre-selected companies may access and use certain information on your device and about your interests to serve ads or personalized content. You may [change your consent choices](https://letterboxd.com/?fc=alwaysshow&fctype=gdpr) at any time (this link will only work for users who see ads).
8. **Log data**: We also receive information when you view content on, or otherwise interact with, our services, which we refer to as “Log Data”, even if you have not created a Letterboxd account. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We use Log Data to operate our services and to ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we use Log Data to protect the security of your account and to determine what features are popular on our services. We also use this data to improve the content we show you and to identify potential misuse of our services.
9. **Payment information**: The Service relies on third parties to process subscription payments, so the Service necessarily must share identifying information with the relevant payment processor in order to know which account the payment will be applied to. We do not otherwise store any of your payment information. All payments are processed by [Paddle](https://paddle.com/), [Apple](https://apple.com/) or [Google](https://google.com/) as merchant of record (collectively, the “Resellers”). As the payment process is entirely and independently carried out by the Resellers, you submit the relevant payment details directly to the Reseller. The Resellers’ respective privacy policies are at [paddle.com/legal](https://paddle.com/legal), [apple.com/legal/privacy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) and [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). For web subscriptions (“Products”), Paddle allows the Service to access the following payment data: your email address and your payment method (e.g. by credit card), but not the specifics of the payment itself, in order to obtain an overview over the Product’s performance. The legitimate interest of Paddle is to transparently communicate its sales of the Product to the Service; the legitimate interest of the Service is to know about its revenues generated by Paddle. The user, data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from Paddle. A revocation shall not have any effect on personal data, which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.
