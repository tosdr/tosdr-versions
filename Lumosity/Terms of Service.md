You own any intellectual property rights to Your Content, but you grant Lumos Labs a world-wide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and sub-licensable license to use, copy, distribute, reproduce, modify, edit, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, translate, create derivative works from, sell, lease, transmit, disassemble, and publish Your Content for purposes of enabling us to offer Lumosity or the features you have elected to use.

You further agree that you have all required rights to post, transmit, or submit Your Content to, through, or on Lumosity without violation of any third-party rights. You understand that Lumos Labs does not control, and is not responsible for, Your Content, and that by using Lumosity, you may be exposed to content from other users that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Content from other users may contain typographical errors, other inadvertent errors, or inaccuracies. You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lumos Labs for all claims resulting from Your Content. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of such disputes, and in any event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

You acknowledge and agree that Lumos Labs and its designees may or may not, at Lumos Labs’s discretion, pre-screen Your Content before its appearance on Lumosity, but that Lumos Labs has no obligation to do so. You further acknowledge and agree that Lumos Labs reserves the right (but does not assume the obligation) in its sole discretion to reject, move, edit or remove any of Your Content that is contributed to Lumosity. Without limiting the foregoing, Lumos Labs and its designees shall have the right to remove any of Your Content that violates these TOS or is otherwise objectionable in Lumos Labs’s sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that Lumos Labs does not verify, adopt, ratify, or sanction Your Content, and you agree that you must evaluate and bear all risks associated with your use of any content from other users or your reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of that content.

We appreciate when you provide us feedback, comments, questions, or suggestions concerning Lumosity, Lumos Labs, or our services (collectively, "Feedback"). By sending us any Feedback, you represent and warrant (a) that you have the right to disclose the Feedback, (b) that the Feedback does not violate the rights of any other person or entity, and (c) that your Feedback does not contain the confidential or proprietary information of any third party or parties. By sending us any Feedback, you further (i) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Feedback, (ii) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Feedback already under consideration or in development, (iii) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Feedback, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Lumos Labs and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Feedback. This Feedback section shall survive any termination of your Account or Lumosity.

YOU AGREE THAT USE OF LUMOSITY IS AT YOUR OWN SOLE RISK AND THAT LUMOSITY IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS", "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LUMOS LABS AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS AND/OR EMPLOYEES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING LUMOSITY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." This release includes the criminal acts of others.

LUMOS LABS STRIVES TO MAINTAIN LUMOSITY ON A COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE BASIS AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO LUMOSITY AT ALL TIMES.

If we terminate your right to access Lumosity, these TOS will terminate and all rights you have to access Lumosity will immediately terminate; however, certain provisions of these TOS will still apply post termination, including without limitation, the Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims provisions. Termination of your Account may also include, at Lumos Labs’s sole discretion, the deletion of your Account and/or Your Content.

* Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 14 CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

You and Lumos Labs agree that these TOS affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.

If a dispute arises, our goal is to provide you a neutral and cost effective means to resolve it quickly. Most disputes can be resolved informally. Before filing a claim against Lumos Labs, you agree to try to resolve the dispute by contacting us in writing at Lumos Labs, Inc., ATTN: DISPUTE NOTICE, 16 Maiden Lane, Floor 6, San Francisco, CA 94108, or by email to [legal-dispute-notice@lumoslabs.com](mailto:legal-dispute-notice@lumoslabs.com). Before we file a claim against you, we agree to contact you at the email address associated with your Account. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of notice, either you or we may bring a formal proceeding pursuant to the following procedures:

**A. GENERAL.** **YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND LUMOS LABS WILL RESOLVE THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO LUMOSITY OR YOUR USE THEREOF, INCLUDING THESE TOS (collectively, "ARBITRAL CLAIMS")**, with a few exceptions set forth below. The arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.  
ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT. THE RULES, INCLUDING DISCOVERY, ARE DIFFERENT AND NO JUDGE OR JURY IS PRESENT AT AN ARBITRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COST OF LITIGATION, AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED. THE AWARD IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.**

**B. ARBITRATION SERVICES AND RULES.** Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") will administer the arbitration using the JAMS’ procedures and rules in effect on the date the Arbitration is filed ("JAMS Rules"). In the event the JAMS Rules are inconsistent with this Agreement to Arbitrate, this Agreement will prevail. JAMS is independent from us, and you may obtain copies of the current JAMS Rules, and other related materials, including forms and instructions for initiating arbitration, by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614 1-800-352-5267 or [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/).

**C. FILING AND ARBITRATION FEES.** To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including arbitrator and hearing expenses. Except as explicitly provided herein, you are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

**D. LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.** If your claim is for $7,500 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. Regardless of the amount of your claim, any in-person hearing will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, CA, or any other location you and we mutually agree to.

**E. SETTLEMENT AWARDS AND FEE REIMBURSEMENT.** If you prevail, and the arbitrator issues an award that exceeds our best written settlement offer that we made prior to 30 days into the arbitration (or if we did not make a settlement offer before that point), then we will pay you the amount of the award or $7,500, whichever is greater. Also, if you prevail, and the arbitrator issues an award that exceeds our best written settlement offer that we made prior to 30 days into the arbitration (or if we did not make a settlement offer before that point) and the amount of the award is less than $7,500, we will reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

**F. EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRAL CLAIMS.** As an exception to this Section 14, you may assert claims on an individual basis, if they qualify under applicable rules, in Small Claims court. Also, either you or we may bring claims to enforce intellectual property rights without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution described in this Section 14.

**G. CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU AND LUMOS LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE WITH LUMOS LABS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR LUMOS LABS WILL JOIN ANY ARBITRAL CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING;** THAT NO ARBITRAL CLAIM WILL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS; THAT NEITHER YOU NOR LUMOS LABS WILL ASSERT AN ARBITRAL CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE; AND BOTH PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

**H. NO RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL.** YOU AND LUMOS LABS ALSO HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL EVEN IF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS HELD NOT TO APPLY. **YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER PARTY SELECTS ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.**

**I. 30 DAY OPT OUT RIGHT.** You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and the class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 14 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Lumos Labs, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 16 Maiden Lane, Floor 6, San Francisco, CA 94108, or by email to [opt-out@lumoslabs.com](mailto:opt-out@lumoslabs.com). For new users, the notice must be sent within 30 days of registering for Lumosity, and for existing users, the notice must be sent within 30 days of the effective date of this policy. If you do not opt-out, you shall be bound to the terms in this Section 14. If you choose to opt-out, Lumos Labs also will not be bound.

**J. CHANGES TO THIS SECTION.** We will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on Lumosity, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your Account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on Lumosity or sent to you.

Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled "Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims," and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section in existence after you began using Lumosity.

**K. SURVIVAL.** This Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section shall survive any termination of your Account or Lumosity.

* General

(a) Severability and Waiver. Except as set forth in the Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section, if any part of the TOS is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the TOS will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting yours and our intent as closely as possible. Either party’s failure to enforce any term or condition in the TOS is not a waiver of its right to do so later.

(b) Transparency in Coverage Notice. This [link](https://www.cigna.com/legal/compliance/machine-readable-files) leads to the machine-readable files that are made available in response to the federal Transparency in Coverage Rule and includes negotiated service rates and out-of-network allowed amounts between health plans and healthcare providers. The machine readable files are formatted to allow researchers, regulators, and application developers to more easily access and analyze data.

(c) Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. Except to the extent preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), the TOS are governed by California law without regard to conflict of law provisions. Except as provided in Section 14, or to the extent preempted by the FAA, both parties further consent to the personal jurisdiction of and exclusive venue in the federal and state courts in San Francisco County, California as the legal forum for any dispute between them.

(d) Change Policy. The TOS may be updated from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide advance notice to you either by email, by posting a notification on Lumosity or by posting an updated TOS on Lumosity at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of the updated TOS. Please note that unless otherwise provided by applicable law or as set forth above in the Agreement to Arbitrate and Waiver of Class Action Claims section, your continued use of Lumosity following the effective date means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the updated TOS.

(e) Miscellaneous. The TOS are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersede all previous written and oral agreements relating to the subject matter of the TOS. If there is any conflict between the TOS and any additional terms, conditions, and rules posted by Lumos Labs on Lumosity, the TOS shall govern, unless otherwise indicated. Sections 2-15 shall survive any termination of the TOS.
