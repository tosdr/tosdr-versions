Privacy Policy
==============

_Effective date: January 1, 2020._

üïØ

Callouts like this summarize the spirit of each section in plain language. We will always strive to respect the spirit of the policy as described in the callouts. However, these simplifications are not binding legalese.

This Privacy Policy ("Our Policy", or the "Policy") explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our website (Candle.to), and any software provided on or in connection with our services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").

1\. Information we collect
--------------------------

üïØ

We collect user information to anonymously identify returning users, for purposes of facilitating users‚Äô logging in their accounts, and for billing and security purposes.

### Registration Information

We may collect information needed to register and sign into the Service, such as your e-mail address.

### Profile Information

We may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, picture, country, and city.

### Location Information

We may collect location data while you are actively using the Service on a mobile device. This information is not shared externally and may be used by the Service to offer you more locally relevant search results and other information.

### Logging Information

We log information reported by our servers or your device each time you use the Service. This information includes your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, device platform (iOS, Android), and user id. This information is used for diagnostics and to improve our Service.

### Search Information

We collect anonymized aggregate information about searches done using our services. We can correlate such aggregate search information down to city-level, but no further. We also collect and store search history information for the purposes of offering these to registered and logged in users.

2\. How we use your information
-------------------------------

üïØ

Personal information is used to improve the service and to provide our users visibility and control over their search experience. We do not intend to personalize results based on user behavior without the explicit consent of the user.

In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:

* Help you efficiently sign in and authenticate with the Service
* Provide personalized suggestions and information to you and others
* Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service
* Develop and test new products and features
* For technical support and detecting bugs and/or crashes in our Service
* Monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and geographic patterns

3\. Sharing of your information
-------------------------------

üïØ

We will not sell, rent, or give away your information. We expect any change of ownership to respect this.

We will not rent or sell your information to third parties without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.

### Assignment and/or Change of Control

If we incorporate, sell, or otherwise transfer part or the whole of the Service, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be assigned and/or transferred to the new entity. The buyer, transferee, or new entity will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

### Instances where we may be required to share your information

Candle will disclose your information where required to do so by law or by judicial process or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to:

* Comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement
* Enforce our [Terms of Use](https://candle.to/terms.html)
* Protect the security or integrity of our Service
* Exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Candle, our Users or others

üê•

Candle and/or Cloup, Inc. have never been required to submit any user information by law to governmental authorities.

4\. How we store your information
---------------------------------

üïØ

We'll keep your information safe.

### Storage and Processing

Information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States, or any other country in which the Service is made available. The information will be stored in tools, machines, databases and/or facilities provided and maintained by Candle or Service Providers.

5\. Your choices about your information
---------------------------------------

üïØ

If you tell us to delete your information, we will, but anything that's already been anonymized and aggregated can't be removed ‚Äî because we can't identify such information with any individual.

You may unsubscribe from any email communications or promotions that are not Service-related (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices are all Service-related).

### How long we keep your User Content

Following termination or deactivation of your account, Candle may retain information (including your profile information) and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.

Anonymized user data may be accessible to certain types of persons involved with the operation of the Service (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration, developers, and/or designers) or Service Providers (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary to transfer, back-up, or store the data.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, Candle cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Candle or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes made by other social media services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.

6\. How to contact us

7\. Changes to our privacy policy
---------------------------------

Candle may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Candle or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
