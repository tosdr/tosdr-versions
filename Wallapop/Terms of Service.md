Terms and Conditions for Business Users
=======================================

### **1.- Am I a business user on Wallapop?**

According to the European Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services (hereinafter, “**P2B Regulation**”), if you are a business user on Wallapop you have a series of rights and obligations that you must know.

Before being informed of these rights and obligations, you must know what should be understood as a business user to determine if these Terms and Conditions for Business Users  (hereinafter, the “**Conditions**”) apply to you or not.

In this regard, we will help you with the following definition: according to the current regulation, a “business user” is considered to be any private individual acting within the framework of a commercial or professional activity or any legal entity (e.g. a company, foundation, or association) that offers goods or services to consumer users through our platform for purposes relating to their trade, business, craft, or profession (hereinafter, “**Business User**”).

### **2.- Definitions**

According to the abovementioned P2B Regulation, there are several definitions that can be of your interest as a Business User in order to properly understand these Conditions.

Without limitation, the following definitions are highlighted:

– “**Online intermediation services**”: means services which constitute information society services; allow Business Users to offer goods or services to consumers, with a view to facilitating the initiation of direct transactions between those Business Users and consumers, irrespective of where those transactions are ultimately concluded; and are provided to Business Users on the basis of contractual relationships between the provider of those services and Business Users which offer goods or services to consumers.

– “**Provider of online intermediation services**”: means any natural or legal person which provides, or which offers to provide, online intermediation services to Business Users. In these Conditions, the Provider of online intermediation services is Wallapop.

– “**Consumer**”: means any natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside this person’s trade, business, craft or profession.

– “**Ranking**”: means the relative prominence given to the goods or services offered through online intermediation services (such as those provided by Wallapop), organised, or communicated by the Providers of online intermediation services, irrespective of the technological means used for such presentation, organisation or communication. This is the criteria used by Wallapop to post on its platform the user’s advertisements.

– “**Mediation**”: means a structured process whereby two or more parties to a dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an agreement on the settlement of their dispute with the assistance of a mediator.

– “**Durable medium**”: means any instrument which enables Business Users to store information addressed personally to them in a way accessible for future reference and for a period of time adequate for the purposes of the information and allows the unchanged reproduction of the information stored.

### **3.- Applicable Conditions**

These Conditions describe your rights and responsibilities regarding your use of our platform (the “**Services**”). If you are a Business User (as defined above), these Conditions govern your access to and use of our Services in addition to the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/) and our [Privacy Policy](https://about.wallapop.com/en/privacy-policy/), applicable to all users.

P2B Regulation and these Conditions are applicable both to Wallapop and to you if you are a Business User. They are therefore legally binding.

These Conditions, the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/) and the [Privacy Policy](https://about.wallapop.com/en/privacy-policy/), together form a binding contract between the Business User and Wallapop. If you use a specific service such as a payment or delivery service, its terms and conditions will also form part of the contract. The terms “we”, “our”, and “us” refer to Wallapop, S.L.

Please note that if you identify any contradiction between these Conditions and the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/), these Conditions shall take precedence.

### **4.- What do you have to take into account in the event that these Conditions are modified?**

Wallapop shall notify Business Users in a durable medium of any proposed content modifications to these Conditions.

The proposed modifications shall not be implemented before the end of the notification period, which shall be reasonable and proportionate with respect to the nature and extent of the intended changes as well as the consequences for the Business User.

The notice period shall be at least fifteen (15) days from the date on which Wallapop communicates the proposed changes. Longer periods shall be provided where necessary to allow Business Users to make technical or commercial adjustments to comply with the modifications.

The Business User affected by such changes shall have the right to terminate the contract before the expiry of the notice period. Such termination shall be effective within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the notice, unless a shorter period applies to the contract.

The Business User affected may waive the notice period, either in writing or by clear affirmative action, at any time after receipt of the notice.

During the notice period, the offer of new goods or services shall be deemed a clear affirmative action to waive the notice period, except in cases where the notice period is longer than fifteen (15) days.

The fifteen (15) day notice period shall not apply where Wallapop:

1. Is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation that requires it to modify the Conditions in a way that does not allow Wallapop to comply with the notice period.
2. Must exceptionally modify the Conditions in order to address an unforeseen and imminent danger related to the defence of online intermediary services, consumers or Business Users against fraud, malware, spam, data security breaches, other cybersecurity risks or similar risks.

Wallapop shall not impose retroactive modifications to the Conditions, except where it must comply with a legal or regulatory obligation or where retroactive modifications are beneficial to Business Users.

### **5.- Reasons why a decision** **to suspend or restrict Wallapop’s Service may be triggered**

There are a number of circumstances which may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of the Services of your Wallapop account as a Business User.

Your account Services may be suspended in the following cases:

1. For security reasons. We may suspend your account for security reasons, or due to reorganisation of IT resources and in order to improve their provision or configuration. In such cases, we will do our best to keep disruptions to a minimum.
2. If you do not comply with our rules of use. If you do not comply with the rules for the use of the Service regulated in clause 3 and/or the rules for the publication of advertisements regulated in clause 8 of the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/). In this case, Wallapop will contact you to inform you of this situation, unless one of the exceptions is applicable which exempts Wallapop from notifying this fact in accordance with the regulations, as will be explained below.
3. If one of your advertisements is reported by users or third parties as fraudulent or illegal. In such case, the advertisement will be disabled from the Wallapop platform and you will be notified. Wallapop will offer you the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances that led to the decision of disabling the advertisement, as mentioned above, insofar as the exceptions to the duty to notify the suspension or restriction do not apply.

The **suspension or restriction** of the Services of the Business User account implies that you will not be able to access the advertisements published on the Wallapop platform for the duration of the suspension or that you will not be able to access the advertisements that have been disabled. When you solve the issue after Wallapop has notified you of this suspension or restriction/disabling of the advertisement(s), you will be able to access your Business User account or the disabled advertisement(s) again and, if applicable, publish the advertisement(s) again.

In these cases of **suspension**, **restriction**, or **disabling** of advertisements, Wallapop will **notify you beforehand or simultaneously** about the action to be taken on your account or your advertisements. Specifically, Wallapop will send you a written communication indicating the reasons for the suspension or restriction of Services. The communication may be sent via the email address provided by you when registering as a Business User or by any other means that is considered to be a durable medium.

There are **certain exceptions to the duty to notify** the suspension/restriction of Services and the reasons why they were undertaken. Wallapop does not have to provide a statement of reasons where it is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation not to state the specific facts or circumstances or reference to the applicable reason(s), or where it can demonstrate that the Business User has repeatedly breached these Conditions or the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/).

The suspension or restriction of the Services or the removal of advertisements due to these reasons shall not give rise to any right to compensation or remuneration that you may claim from Wallapop.

In the event of temporary suspension, restriction or disabling, you may use the dispute resolution system set up by Wallapop for Business Users. This system has been set up to manage possible claims and discrepancies that may arise between Wallapop and you during the provision of the Services linked to your account. You can obtain more information about this system in clauses 9 and 10 of these Conditions.

In case of restriction or suspension, Wallapop gives the Business User the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances within the framework of the internal complaint handling procedure.

When the restriction or suspension is revoked by Wallapop, it shall without undue delay reinstate the Business User, including with regard to access to personal or other data that was generated by their use of the Services before the restriction or suspension took effect.

### **6.- Reasons why a decision to terminate Wallapop’s Service may be triggered**

We inform you that in certain cases Wallapop may proceed to the termination of the Service contract linked to your Business User account.

The following are causes for termination of the provision of Services linked to your account:

1. Failure to pay for the Services contracted as a Business User.
2. Repeated non-compliance of the rules for the use of the Service regulated in the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/).
3. Unilateral termination by the Business User, at any time and without giving any reason whatsoever, notwithstanding that the parties may agree on other terms.

In the event of early termination of the Services linked to the Business User’s account due to a manifest infringement by Wallapop, you may be entitled to a refund of the proportional part already paid for such Services in advance.

The early termination of the Services does not extinguish or modify the rights and obligations of the Business Users or Wallapop arising prior to the early termination of the Services. In other words, invoices issued or to be issued for Services provided by Wallapop up to the effective date of termination shall be deemed due and payable and shall be passed on to the Business User, if applicable.

If Wallapop terminates all of the Business User’s Services, it shall provide the Business User, at least thirty (30) days before the termination takes effect, with a statement of the reasons justifying the decision on a durable medium.

This period shall not apply when Wallapop (neither the written statement):

1. Is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation that requires it to terminate or restrict the provision of all Services to a Business User in a way that does not allow it to respect such notice period.
2. Exercises its right of termination for an overriding reason under applicable regulations.
3. Can prove that the Business User concerned has repeatedly breached these Conditions and/or the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/legal-terms-and-conditions/), resulting in the termination or restriction of the Services.

### **7.- What are the consequences of the termination of Wallapop’s Services?**

In the event of termination of the Services, as a Business User you have a migration period of thirty (30) additional calendar days from the end of the contracted period of Services. Or, in the event of non-compliance, you shall have the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, which shall commence with the notification announcing the termination.

During this period of time, you may download the information and content generated on the Wallapop platform. After this period of time, Wallapop will comply with the processing and retention periods regulated in the [Privacy Policy](https://about.wallapop.com/en/privacy-policy/)

If the reason for termination of the Services is because you have breached the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/) as a Business User, you will have ten (10) days to justify your action before terminating the Services. If, after a review, Wallapop considers that you have not acted against the [Terms and Conditions of use](https://about.wallapop.com/en/legal-terms-and-conditions/), these Conditions and/or the [Privacy Policy](https://about.wallapop.com/en/privacy-policy/) of Wallapop, we will reinstate access to your business account and the contents of your account.

During the time periods provided for in this section, you can use the available dispute resolution and complaints system. More information about this complaints system can be found in clauses 9 and 10.

In the event of termination, Wallapop offers the Business User the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances within the framework of the internal complaint handling procedure.

When the termination is revoked by Wallapop, it shall without undue delay reinstate the Business User, including with regard to access to personal or other data, or both, that was generated by his or her use of the Services before the restriction or suspension took effect.

### **8.- What are the criteria for classifying advertisements?**

The ranking and visibility of advertisements on Wallapop is carried out based on different criteria such as:

* The date of publication, in chronological order.
* The use of filtering tools offered by our platform, which allows users to select search criteria.
* The existence of paid subscriptions and featured ads.

The criteria that have the greatest impact on the ranking of advertisements and their visibility are paid subscriptions and featured advertisements, which are also paid. The characteristics of subscriptions and featured advertisements are described in the descriptions of such Services located in the help center on the Wallapop website. It should be clear that the criteria that influence the visibility of advertisements the most are those services where the user pays for a special publication service.

Wallapop will maintain and periodically update the variations that may occur in the criteria for the classification of advertisements on its platform.

### **9.- Find out about our complaints and mediation system**

We have set up a free internal complaints handling system to ensure that as a Business User you have a channel through which you can send us complaints. It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that this channel is useful and can resolve complaints within a reasonable period of time.

As a Business User, you will be able to file a complaint in these cases:

1. When you consider that we have not complied with any of our obligations in accordance with the P2B Regulation.
2. When technological problems occur that are directly related to the provision of Services and affect you.
3. When it is based on specific measures or conduct of Wallapop that are directly linked to the provision of Services and affect you.

Once we receive a complaint, we will analyse it with the utmost diligence. In doing so, we will take into account the relevance of the problem raised and the specific circumstances of each case. We will provide you with a reasoned response on the outcome of the procedure in an understandable and individualised written notification.

Please note that during the resolution of the complaint, we may maintain the decision to suspend, restrict or terminate the Service early and, after the complaint has been resolved, measures may be taken to reverse the situation if necessary. We also inform you that as a Business User you may at any time initiate a legal complaint if you deem it appropriate, whether or not the internal complaint procedure has been resolved.

In order to improve the processes, we undertake to verify, at least annually, the correct functioning of this system and, if necessary, make the appropriate changes to improve its effectiveness. If any changes are made to its operation, we will inform you about the amendment of these Conditions.

To file a complaint, you should contact us through this [form](https://ayuda.wallapop.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=13076994262801).

Once the complaint has been received, it will be dealt with internally. Each complaint will be reviewed by a group of Wallapop professionals who will be in charge of resolving it. These professionals will have sufficient knowledge of customer service and of Wallapop’s business model, as well as sufficient legal knowledge to be able to deal with complaints objectively and in accordance with the law.

However, remember that you still have the Wallapop customer service system at your disposal for all issues that may not be as complex or do not involve a claim as such. Evaluate what your situation is and which is the ideal channel for an optimal solution to your problem.

On behalf of Wallapop we will inform you periodically about the use of this system by publishing information about the use that users make of the complaints system. In particular, we will annually verify the information on the functioning and effectiveness of the complaint system and, where significant modifications are necessary, update this information.

This information will specify:

* The total number of complaints submitted.
* The main types of complaints.
* The average time required to process them.
* The aggregated information in relation to the outcome of complaints.

The updated data for 2023 is shown below:

* We have received 9758 cases.
* Primary reason for contact:
    * Account access: 23%.
    * Shipping problem: 10%.
    * Refund times: 8%.
* 100% of queries have been resolved within 82 hours.
* Satisfaction rate: 64%.

### **10.- Can I as a Business User use alternative mediation systems?**

If, despite submitting a complaint and once it has been resolved, you still consider that we have not resolved the dispute, you can access mediation systems to try to resolve the dispute out of court.

In accordance with the above, Wallapop will provide two dispute resolution mediators whose actions will meet the following requirements:

* They shall be impartial and independent
* Their mediation services shall be affordable for Wallapop Business Users.
* May provide mediation services in the language of the Conditions governing the contractual relationship,
* They shall be easily accessible either physically at the establishment or residence of the Business User or remotely using communication technologies.
* They shall be able to provide their mediation services without undue delay.
* They shall have sufficient knowledge to be able to contribute effectively to the resolution of disputes.

Accordingly, Wallapop provides access to the following dispute resolution mediators:

* Institución de Mediación B2B de Confianza Online, linked to: [https://www.mediaciononlineb2b.es/](https://www.mediaciononlineb2b.es/)
* [Conflict Management Advisers Mediación B2B](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fb2bcma.com%2Fmediacion-b2b%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cjoanaloc.pons%40es.gt.com%7C98e63cb9d38a460a554608db2f649c48%7Ca8803954c6a64d60b4e1d78ecb2ca82a%7C0%7C0%7C638155881412224492%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=PUhp8i3okDXpJY7MybDc3KY2ZrcKQO2EpoQb01dnxmo%3D&reserved=0)

In addition to the above, other mediation entities of recognised prestige may be appointed.

Please note that Wallapop will bear a reasonable part of the costs of mediation in each individual case, but the rest of the costs shall be charged to the Business User who has requested mediation.

Finally, we would like to inform you that going to mediation does not remove your right to take legal action, which we can also take. In other words, mediation is an option, not an obligation, and at no time will it limit the rights of either party to effective judicial protection.
