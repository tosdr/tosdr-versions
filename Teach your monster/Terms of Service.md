**Teach Your Monster: User Agreement App and Web**
--------------------------------------------------

### **The Basics**

* This site and the games and other services offered through it, the “Game Service”, is intended to be used by teachers and parents/guardians as a teaching tool for children. (“Students”).
* Teachers and parents/guardians may register on the site, and as a result become “Users”.
* Users may set up individual accounts for their Students, which allow the Students to access, and the User to track Students’ performance in their use of, the Game Service.
* Accounts may only be established by Users, and not by Students themselves; Students must have Users’ permission to use the Game Service.

This User Agreement is to be read in conjunction with the following:

●        Teach Your Monster Ltd – [Privacy Policy](https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/privacy-policy)

### **1\. Introduction**

This Teach Your Monster User Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal document which sets out your rights and obligations, and those of Teach Your Monster Limited, incorporated and registered in England and Wales as a company limited by guarantee with Company Number 08821419 (“TYM Ltd”, “Teach Your Monster Ltd.”, “we” or “us) and in relation to the Game Service.

You must take the time to read and understand this Agreement before registering for the Game Service. By registering, you accept that you are entering into a contract with us on the terms of this Agreement. Visitors to the Game Service who do not register to become a User similarly affirm that they are bound by this Agreement each time they access the Game Service.

Some of the points addressed in this Agreement will have relevance only if and when certain functionality, such as the ability for Users or Students to interact with each other through the Game Service, is introduced by us. However, it is important that we make you aware of those points at the time you enter into this Agreement with us.

You should be aware that this Agreement may change from time to time in accordance with Clause 18 below.

### **2\. Registration**

When you register to become a User, we ask you to provide some information about yourself. You must be honest about this information.

You must not choose a username that could potentially infringe anyone’s rights, which is intended to confuse, or which is offensive, hurtful or otherwise inappropriate, as reasonably determined by us. We may change a username if we think it offends this Agreement.

Important: You must ensure that the email address we hold for you is kept up-to-date and that you have full access to it – we may send you important messages there. If you change email address, then you must inform us of the new address through your account on the Game Service.

### **3\. Accounts for Students**

Users may set up individual Accounts for their Students. We are sensitive to the privacy and child protection issues that arise from being provided with information that uniquely identifies an individual child: we do not wish to be put in a position whereby we hold that kind of information. Therefore, we strongly recommend that Users identify Students’ accounts by names that are anonymous or incomplete.  Do not use student’s full names.

Note that we do not request or hold email addresses for Students – only for Users.

### **4\. Privacy policy**

TYM Ltd's [Privacy Policy](https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/privacy-policy) forms part of this Agreement, and by agreeing to this Agreement, you also give your acknowledgment to the way we may handle your personal data as detailed in that policy.

### **5\. Games and other Media; new services**

We provide you with access to games, videos, printables, and other forms of content  (collectively, “Media”) through the Game Service. We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited licence to use the Media on any compatible computer from which you access the Game Service. All Media is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties and is owned by us, our affiliates or licensors. You may not sell or redistribute the Media. You may not incorporate it or any portion of it into another product. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Media or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, except where (and to the extent) expressly permitted by law to do so. You may not modify, adapt or create derivative works from the Media in any way or remove proprietary notices in the Media.

TYM Ltd or its affiliates may offer new or additional services through the Game Service from time to time. Your use of them may be subject to additional terms and conditions, or rules of use, which you must comply with. Any failure by you to comply with a material provision of the terms or rules governing such additional services will amount to a breach of this Agreement. We reserve the right to introduce charges for the Game Service in the future; currently we do not charge Users (or Students) to access or use it.

### **6\. Operation of Game Services**

TYM Ltd reserves the right to withdraw or modify aspects of the Game Service, or the entirety of it, where we have legal or commercial reasons to do so. There may also be times when the Game Service becomes inaccessible as a result of technical difficulties experienced by TYM Ltd or on the Internet; we will, however, use reasonable skill and care to overcome these difficulties where they are within our control.

There may be times when we make the Game Service unavailable so that we can conduct technical work on it. Therefore, please note that we cannot guarantee that the Game Service will always be available at times of your choosing.

Note that we will never ask you for your password, and that you are solely responsible for maintaining the safety and secrecy of your password and any additional identifying information. You will be responsible for the activities of anyone who uses your password to gain access to your account. If you think that someone may have obtained your password, you must change it immediately.

### **7\. TYM Ltd's Role**

We are not and cannot be responsible for the behaviour of Users - whether on the Game Service or outside of it. In particular, you should be aware that TYM Ltd does not pre-screen or monitor the material contributed by Users.

You can report all inappropriate communication or behaviour to us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.teachyourmonster.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### **8\. Misuse of Game Service**

The Game Service is intended to be used by its Users for the purposes we describe in this Agreement and on the Game Service itself. Accordingly, Users must not (a) place material on, or otherwise use, the Game Service for any business or commercial purpose; or (b) use their access to the Game Service, or information gathered from it, in connection with the sending of unsolicited bulk email (sometimes known as spam). In addition, Users (and Students associated with the User’s account) must not (i) be abusive, discriminatory or threatening, or harass or communicate offensive messages or images to another User or any Student, whether or not through the Game Service; (ii) infringe the intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity, (iii) breach any applicable law, whether criminal, tortious or otherwise, or (iv) disrupt others’ use of the Game Service.

We reserve the right (a) to suspend or terminate any User's access to the Game Service, or parts of it, and/or (b) to remove, or require the User to remove, material posted on the Game Service, if the User or material appears to us, or to someone who has complained to us, to be in breach of any provision of this Agreement.

Any person whose access has been suspended or terminated must not re-register for, or re-access, the Game Service without our prior consent. You are responsible for everything which is done on or through the Game Service while your User account (or the accounts of any Student associated with your User account) is logged on to the Game Service, or through your or their email address(es).

For completeness, where we reserve a right in this Agreement, it does not mean we are obliged to exercise it.

### **9\. Alerting TYM Ltd**

If you see anything on the Game Service which appears to infringe this Agreement, then please contact us to inform us of it by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.teachyourmonster.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We rely upon Users to point out material contributed by other Users which may infringe this Agreement.

### **10\. Disclaimer and Release**

TYM Ltd has no control over or responsibility for the truth or accuracy of any material available on the Game Service that is provided by Users or others. If any third party sites are linked to from the Game Service, this does not mean that we endorse or have any responsibility for the site in question or anything which appears on it. You should exercise no lesser degree of caution in appraising what you see on the Game Service than you do offline.

Even though Users are prohibited from doing so, people may provide information, or otherwise behave, in a way that is unreliable, misleading or even illegal. Further, you should note that people may not necessarily be who they say they are.

To the extent that the law permits, you release TYM Ltd its directors, contractors and employees from all liability (including in relation to disputes with other Users) arising out of your use of a third party site or arising out of or in connection with the material included on the Game Service by Users and other third parties.

### **11\. Intellectual Property**

You acknowledge that all copyright, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights in and relating to the Game Service (including the Media and other content that we make available) are owned by TYM Ltd or its licensors. These rights protect all of the games you see on the Game Service, including the graphics of those games, their structure, gameplay and their “look and feel”. It is easy to copy material which appears on web-sites, but this does not mean it is legal. Therefore, no-one may copy, distribute, communicate to the public or create any derivative work from the Game Service, or any part of the games or other material which is found on the Game Service unless properly licensed to do so by us.

By submitting any material to the content to the Game Service, you:

* are representing that you are fully entitled to do so;
* grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-terminable licence to copy, modify, distribute, show in public and create derivative works from that material in any form, anywhere; and
* authorise us to adapt the relevant material in the course of doing so, and so waive your moral rights to object to any derogatory treatment, or to be identified as the author, of the material in question.

### **12\. Data Protection**

12.1 In this clause 12, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

“**User Personal Data**” means personal data of a legal person who creates an account on the site.

**“Data Protection Legislation**” shall mean the Data Protection Act 2018, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 or any successor and all applicable laws and regulations relating to processing of personal data and privacy, including where applicable the guidance and codes of practice issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office including any amending or replacement legislation in force from time to time.”

“**Data Controller**”, “**Data Processor**”, “**Data Subject**” and “**Personal Data”**, , “**Special Category Data”**, “**Personal Data Breach”**, processing and appropriate technical and organisational measures shall have the meanings given to them in the Data Protection Legislation.

“**Purpose**” means the use of User Personal Data for the purposes of performing the Game Service in accordance with the Agreement.

12.2 Each party acknowledges that the factual arrangement between them dictates the role of each party in respect of the Data Protection Legislation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties anticipate that you shall act as a Data Controller and we shall act as a Data Processor in respect of processing the User Personal Data as follows:

(a) You shall be a Data Controller in respect of the User Personal Data used to register an account to use the site;

(b) We shall be a Data Processor where we are processing User Personal Data on behalf of schools/educators and/or teachers for the Purpose;

(c) There may also be circumstances where we act as a Data Controller (for example in relation to any User Personal Data we collect to administer the Game Service or where we contact Users for marketing purposes).

12.3 We each agree to comply with the Data Protection Legislation in relation to the User Personal Data at all times.

12.4 Where we process User Personal Data on behalf of schools/educators and/or teachers, section 12.5 of the Agreement will apply, however where we act as a Data Controller we will not be subject to section 12.5 of this Agreement.

12.5 When processing User Personal Data on behalf of schools/educators and/or teachers, we shall:

(a) Only process the User Personal Data for the Purpose and we will not use the User Personal Data for any other purpose;

(c) Ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process User Personal Data are obliged to keep the User Personal Data confidential;

(d) You consent to us transferring User Personal Data outside of the UK and the European Economic Area where the transfer is conducted in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation;

(f) Clause 12.5.(e) above also applies to any breaches of security which may compromise the security of the User Personal Data;

(g) Provide you with reasonable assistance in responding to any Data Subject requests in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation;

(h) Provide you with reasonable assistance in responding to any request for information received from the Information Commissioner’s Office;

(k) You consent to us appointing sub-processors as third-party processors of User Personal Data under this Agreement to assist us in delivering the Game Service to you under the Agreement.  We confirm that we have entered or (as the case may be) will enter into a written agreement with the third party processor substantially on that third party's standard terms of business. You also consent to us appointing any replacement third party processors.  Here is an up to date list of our [third party processors](https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/third-party-providers). You are responsible for regularly checking the site for any changes to the list of third party processors;

(l) Maintain registration with the Information Commissioner’s Office where required to do so under the Data Protection Legislation to process the Customer Personal Data for the Purpose.

### **13\. Excluded loss**

We will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss not reasonably foreseeable by us when this Agreement commences, for any indirect or consequential loss or damage, or for any loss of data, profit, revenue or business, howsoever caused (whether arising out of any negligence or breach of this Agreement or otherwise). TYM Ltd will also not be liable for any failure to perform of its obligations under this Agreement caused by matters beyond its reasonable control.

### **18\. Entire Agreement**

This Agreement includes our [privacy policy](https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/privacy-policy).

TYM Ltd reserves the right to change this Agreement from time to time, and post the new version on the Game Service. When we do so, we notify Users of the fact on the User’s Account Homepage, and post or link to the new Agreement there. This Agreement, and any new version of it in the future, takes effect immediately or upon such date as we specify on the main screen. However, if you do not wish to be bound by the changes we make in this Agreement (or any new version of it), then you can choose instead to remain bound by the previous TYM Ltd Terms and Conditions until one month after the date when we post the new version.

### **20\. Severability**

In the event that any term of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by judicial decree or decision, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable.

### **21\. Law**

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

### **22\. Keeping this Agreement**

We don't separately file the individual Agreements entered into by members when they register for the Game Service. You can access it at https://teachyourmonster.org/legals. Please make a durable copy of this Agreement by printing and/or saving a downloaded copy on your own computer.
