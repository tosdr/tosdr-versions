10\. **International Transfers.** By using our Services and providing us with information, you understand that your information is being collected and stored on, and may be transferred to, servers located outside your resident jurisdiction. We and many of our third-party vendors are based in the United States, and your information is being processed by us both here and in other jurisdictions where laws may not be equivalent to those where you reside. To the extent we disclose your information to third-party vendors, we use contractual safeguards to help ensure that such third-party vendors are bound to duties of confidentiality. Where local law permits, you are deemed to have consented to these data transfer practices through your use of the Services. If you do not consent to these data transfers practices, please do not use the Services. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) with respect to data protection issues. If you would like further information please contact us.

We maintain security measures to safeguard your information from loss, theft, interference, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. However, you should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, accurate, complete, and/or current. Please note that information collected by third-parties may not have the same security protections as the information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.
