**Active monthly users (as of June 30, 2024)**: Under Article 24 of the Digital Services Act (the "**DSA**"), on-line platforms are required to publish information on the average monthly active recipients of services in the EU at least every six (6) months. This is for the purposes of determining whether an on-line platform is a very large on-line platform ("**VLOP**"), reaching an average of at least 45 million users per month in the EU (i.e., representing 10% of the EU population). VLOPs are subject to additional requirements due to the role they play in the dissemination of content throughout the EU. Article 24(2) and other provisions of the DSA provide guidance for on-line platforms in calculating the number of average monthly active recipients of the service, including limiting this number to recipients located in the EU, excluding visits from automated bots and scrapers, and counting only unique visits, i.e., counting multiple visits by the same user to different sites or interfaces of the same platform only once in each month. We have calculated the average monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU based on the period from January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024, in accordance with Recital 77 of the DSA. Our conclusion is that during this period the average number of monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU was below the 45 million users threshold for being designated as a VLOP. We will continue to monitor the number of average monthly active recipients of our platform services in the EU and will publish updated information in accordance with Article 24(2).

Note that Blitz Studios, Inc. is the controller of personal data collected through the Services.

To the extent we disclose your information to third-party vendors, we use contractual safeguards to help ensure that such third-party vendors are bound to duties of confidentiality.

We maintain security measures to safeguard your information from loss, theft, interference, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. However, you should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, accurate, complete, and/or current. Please note that information collected by third-parties may not have the same security protections as the information you submit to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such information.

12. **Changes to the Privacy Notice.** We may modify this Notice from time to time, in our sole discretion. When any such updates are made, we shall revise the “Effective Date” above and post the new Notice version. We recommend that you review the Privacy Notice each time you visit and/or use the Services in order to stay informed of our ongoing practices.
