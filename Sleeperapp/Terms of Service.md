Last Updated: May 2, 2024

Blitz Studios, Inc., and as applicable, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “**Sleeper**,” “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) own and operate the Sleeper mobile application and website, located at [www.sleeper.com](http://www.sleeper.com/), through which we offer free-to-play games, paid-entry contests of skill, and other games, tools, and fantasy sports-related products and services (collectively, the “**Services**”). Before accessing or using the Services, please read these General Terms of Use and any additional terms, rules, guidelines and conditions issued, from time to time, by Sleeper (collectively, the “**Terms**”) carefully.

THESE TERMS CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY, AND A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS FOR RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE WITH US, AS WELL AS AN INDEMNIFICATION PROVISION THAT MAKES YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN LOSSES. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS COLLECTION OF TERMS, THEN DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.**

By creating an account or otherwise accessing and using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our [Privacy Notice](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/5486618-privacy-policy), and all applicable rules that may be published on the Services by Sleeper, including as applicable the [Paid-Entry Contests of Skill Terms of Use](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/6293693-paid-entry-contests-of-skill-terms-of-use), and/or any applicable contest and/or promotion terms conditions, which form a legal agreement between you and us.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to make changes to these Terms at any time. If we supplement, supersede, or make changes to these Terms, such amended Terms will be posted, and will take effect immediately, unless otherwise stated. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such changes, and your use of the Services following these changes, supplements, or other modifications shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as amended.

**1 THESE TERMS**

1.1 You represent and warrant that you have the legal right and ability to agree to these Terms and that you have read, understood, and agree to the Terms with the intent to be legally bound by them.

1.2 By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are the minimum age required to use each game, contest, or other feature within the Services that you access or use. All users of the Services, except for users participating in contests and promotions, must be at least 13 years of age and have parental consent (if under the age of 18) to use the Services. All users shall review the [Privacy Notice](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/5486618-privacy-policy) and the applicable COPPA Notice prior to using any of the Services.

Sleeper verifies all accounts for age and eligibility using applicable legal guidelines. If minors (as defined under applicable statute) have access to your computer or mobile device, please consider adding parental controls to prevent access to Sleeper’s paid-entry contests or other promotions that require users to be at least 18 years of age. If a minor is found to be participating in paid-entry contests on Sleeper, the account that minor was using will be closed and withdrawals will be frozen, at Sleeper’s sole discretion.

1.3 We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to make changes to these Terms at any time. If we supplement, supersede, or make changes to these Terms, such amended Terms will be posted, and will take effect immediately, unless otherwise stated. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such changes, and your use of the Services following these changes, supplements, or other modifications shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as amended.

**2 USING THE SERVICES**

2.1 You must create an account to access the Services. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself and to maintain and promptly update any account information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. Only one (1) account per verified person is permitted. Your account is unique to you and non-transferrable. For the avoidance of doubt, you may not “co-own” an account with another person or entity. You may not use a username for your account that promotes a commercial venture or a username that we determine, in our sole discretion, is offensive or otherwise violates these Terms. We may require you to change your username or may unilaterally change your username without notice to you, in our sole discretion.

2.2 You are also solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, including protecting your login credentials and restricting access to your devices. You agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your login details and keep them secret. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and/or from your devices. If you have reason to believe that someone is using your account without your permission, you should contact us immediately. Your password must, at a minimum: a) not contain your e-mail, b) have at least 8 characters, and c) have 2 of the following: 1 letter (case sensitive), 1 number, and 1 special character (i.e. !@#$%^&\*).

2.3 You consent to transact with us electronically and receive legal notices and other communications electronically, including by e-mail, text messaging, push notifications (in accordance with your device settings), and/or by notices posted on the Services. You agree that any requirement that a communication be sent to you in writing is satisfied by such electronic communication and that you are responsible for maintaining an Internet browser, mobile device or computing equipment capable of accessing the Services and said electronic communications.

2.4 You acknowledge and agree that we may monitor, and record communications related to Service usage and geographic location information for any reason, including and without limitation, in order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We reserve the right to report unusual or suspicious activity to the proper authorities.

2.5 Specific rules, controls, and guidelines for each service, game or contest offered on the Services can be found on our website and/or within the game or contest. Such rules, controls and guidelines form part of these Terms and are incorporated herein. You also agree that any supplemental or additional terms that apply to the use of any game, contest, or other feature offered on the Services form a part of these Terms, and you agree that you shall comply with any such supplemental or additional terms, rules, controls, and guidelines in respect of each individual game or contest which you choose to access and/or play through the Services.

2.6 Sleeper reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including, but not limited to, the availability of any feature, content, or game variant), whether temporarily or permanently at any time for any reason. You agree that Sleeper shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services.

2.7 You agree that the sole and specific purpose of creating an account on Sleeper is to participate in Sleeper’s Services.

2.8 Certain portions of the Services may include integrated, third-party products (each a "**MINI**"). Sleeper does not own, operate, maintain, service, or operate any MINI, nor is Sleeper in any way responsible for any MINI's performance. You understand and agree that by using any MINI on Sleeper's platform you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of the third-party who owns and/or operates that MINI. You understand that Sleeper does not in any way guarantee, in whole or in part, the availability or usability of any MINI, and that any and all questions, comments, or concerns you have regarding any MINI must be directed toward that MINI's third-party owner. You understand and agree that the use of any MINI is undertaken at your sole risk and that you will not hold Sleeper liable or responsible for said use.

**3 SLEEPER WALLET & PAYMENT TERMS**

3.1 You may be eligible to link your bank account and/or a credit card to your Sleeper account in order to create a wallet (a “**Sleeper Wallet**”). Your Sleeper Wallet can be used to fund participation in certain Services we offer, such as our paid-entry contests of skill.

3.2 In order to setup a Sleeper Wallet, you must:

· Be a legal resident of the United States;

· Be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or, in jurisdictions, territories, and locations where the minimum age requirement is higher, you meet that age requirement (19 in Alabama and Nebraska; 21 in Massachusetts);

· Be physically located in one (1) of the fifty (50) states (or the District of Columbia) that is not considered an Excluded State. “**Excluded States**” shall mean: Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington;

· Possess a valid tax identification or social security number;

· Possess (and have the authority to utilize) a valid bank account or credit card issued by a financial institution in the United States (subject to our availability to accept certain forms of payment); and

· Undergo (and pass) an identity/background verification check.

3.3 By inputting a payment method (for a Sleeper Wallet or otherwise), you represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of the payment method account. If you elect to save a payment method to the Services, you agree that your bank or card information will be saved for future transactions on your account, and you provide authorization to be charged for agreed upon payments. You may cancel this authorization by following the instructions in the Services. Our payment processing partners may have their own terms and conditions and you should ensure that you agree with these prior to making any payment(s). If your transaction with our payment processing partners is not successful, then your payment will not be fulfilled. Depending on which financial institution you use, additional charges may be issued by your financial institutions as we have no control over such charges nor accept liability for them.

3.4 You agree that all payments are final and that we are under no obligation to refund any transaction once a payment has been made, subject to applicable law. For these purposes, a payment is complete at the time our servers validate your payment and successfully credit your account on our servers. Deposits made into your Sleeper Wallet will appear on your statement as SLEEPER. In the case of a dispute regarding the identity of a user submitting payment, that payment will be deemed to have been submitted by the user in whose name the respective individual account was registered.

3.5 If your Sleeper Wallet has no activity for twenty-four (24) consecutive months, it will be considered inactive. Sleeper may assess a monthly fee of $4.99 to maintain inactive wallets until it is reactivated by entering a paid-entry contest of skill, making a deposit, or withdrawing funds. Prior to deducting any fees due to wallet inactivity, Sleeper will provide you at least thirty (30) days-written notice.

3.6 Once a Sleeper Wallet is legally found to be abandoned, as determined by each state’s applicable law, it will be considered so, and Sleeper may be required to remit the abandoned funds to the appropriate state agency as unclaimed property. Sleeper reserves the right to deduct fees associated with the delivery of abandoned funds subject to applicable law.

11.2 These Terms shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without regards to the conflicts of law principles. If any clause or provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any authority having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such clause or provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining clauses or provisions of these Terms, including but not limited to the class action waiver. You expressly agree that if you dispute the validity or enforceability of the individual arbitration provision and/or class action waiver in these Terms, you shall bring such dispute in the courts of the State of Delaware, and you expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Furthermore, you agree that any arbitration will take place in Delaware.

11.3 All claims arising in connection with your use of the Services should be reported and brought to our attention as soon as possible in a written statement delivered to [\[email protected\]](https://sleeper.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, and/or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive your rights to bring any claim in connection with your use of the Services unless you bring it within one (1) year of the date of the event giving rise to such claim.

11.4 EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY TO BE HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND SLEEPER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.

11.5 YOU AGREE THAT SLEEPER AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THESE TERMS. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. YOU ALSO AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR CONSOLIDATED CLAIMS INVOLVING ANOTHER PERSON’S ACCOUNT, IF WE ARE A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.

11.6 The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at [http://www.jamsadr.com/](http://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or us that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the arbitrator. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this section enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitrator’s decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable JAMS Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law.

11.7 To not be bound by the arbitration agreement set forth in this section, within thirty (30) days of using our Services, you must notify Sleeper in writing of your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provisions.
