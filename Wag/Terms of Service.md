**6\. Wag! as a Marketplace Technology Platform**

The Services include a marketplace technology platform that connects Pet Care Providers with Pet Owners. We do not provide any pet care services and make no representations or warranties about the quality of pet walking, boarding, sitting, transportation, or other services provided by Pet Care Providers, or about your interactions and dealings with Pet Care Providers or other users. Wag! does not employ, recommend, or endorse Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers, and we are not responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers, whether online or offline. Wag! does not procure insurance for Pet Owners (or their pets) or Pet Care Providers, nor is Wag! responsible for the property of Pet Owners or Pet Care Providers.

Wag! provides Pet Care Providers with access to third-party vendors that perform background checks and verifications.  Wag! itself does not conduct background checks and does not independently verify information in the background checks.  Wag! is not responsible or liable in any manner for the background checks.

**7\. Payment Terms for Pet Owners**

7.1 General Payment Terms

As a Pet Owner, you understand that use of the Services may result in you owing fees to the Pet Care Provider for the pet care services you receive from such Pet Care Provider.  Wag! will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Pet Care Provider through third-party payment processors, with whom you will be required to establish an account to access the Services.  Payment of such charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Pet Care Provider.  Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law.  Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Services, Wag!’s decision to terminate your usage, any disruption of the Services, or any other reason whatsoever, unless otherwise determined by Wag!.

All charges are due immediately and Wag!, or a third-party payment processor, will process your payment on the Pet Care Provider’s behalf using the primary payment method designated by you in your Wag! account.  If your primary payment method is determined to be expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Wag! may, as the Pet Care Provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your account, if available.

Pet Owners and Pet Care Providers transact with each other on the Wag! marketplace technology platform when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of pet care services via the booking mechanism provided on the Wag! marketplace technology platform.  You may choose to transact with certain Pet Care Providers from time to time based on a variety of factors in your discretion, such as your desired price range, a Pet Care Provider’s pet service price rate, a Pet Care Provider’s profile, and a Pet Care Provider’s star ratings and reviews.  Once you request a pet care service, you agree to pay the Pet Care Provider the agreed-to price and honor the other terms of such booking.  You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Pet Care Provider at any time prior to such Pet Care Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be subject to a cancellation fee.

The fees owed to Pet Care Providers are not inclusive of tip or gratuity for the Pet Care Provider.  While you are free to provide gratuity to any Pet Care Provider who provides you with services obtained through the Services, you are under no obligation to do so.  After you have received services or goods obtained through the Services, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Pet Care Provider.

In addition to the above fees, you understand and acknowledge that you may incur ancillary charges in connection with your receipt of pet care services from Pet Care Providers (“Charges”). Such Charges may include some combination of the following: (1) cancellation fee, (2) service, booking, or platform usage fee, (3) trust and safety fee, (4) surcharges, (5) convenience fee, and (6) other fees.  A description of any Charges will be available on the Services.  You have absolute discretion to request or not request services from a Pet Care Provider if the total applicable fee or charge is not acceptable to you.

From time to time, Wag! may, in its sole discretion, make available certain promotions, offers, credits, rewards, subscriptions, or referrals links or codes to Pet Owners (the “Promotions”).  Such Promotions will be provided to Pet Owners via the Services, by email, or otherwise made available electronically by Wag!.  Such Promotions are only valid for redemption through the Services and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law.  Each Promotion is a limited time offer and is valid only for the time and purpose and under the terms and conditions specified therein, which may include eligibility, time, and location requirements.  Wag!, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to issue Promotions with different features, discounts, offers, or deals to any users or groups of users determined solely by Wag!.  These Promotions, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your use of the Services or any Promotions offered to you.  Wag! reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of Promotions that were made in error or obtained through fraud or suspected illegal behavior, or where the Pet Owner was found to be in violation of the terms of such Promotion, these Terms, or the Additional Terms.  Promotions may be modified, disabled, or withdrawn by Wag! at any time for any reason or no reason without liability to Wag!.

You acknowledge and agree that Wag! may limit or temporarily or permanently suspend your use of or access to the Services if: (1) you have provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated, or incomplete information regarding a payment method, (2) any amounts you owe for pet care services are overdue or in default, or (3) Wag! believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Wag!, our users, any third-party payment processor or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity.

7.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation

**WAG! PREMIUM PAID MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS WILL CONTINUE INDEFINITELY UNTIL CANCELLED BY YOU. AFTER YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION COMMITMENT PERIOD, AND AGAIN AFTER ANY SUBSEQUENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD EQUIVALENT TO THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM YOU ORIGINALLY SELECTED AND AT THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE AND FREQUENCY DISCLOSED TO YOU WHEN YOU ORIGINALLY SUBSCRIBED, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED AT THE TIME YOU SUBSCRIBED.** 

You may cancel your paid membership subscription at any time by following the instructions on your account settings page or by contacting Customer Success at (855) 732-9513 or [wagsupport@wagwalking.com](mailto:wagsupport@wagwalking.com).  If you cancel your subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term.  Your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your payment method will be charged, and you will be required to pay any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.

**7.3 Payment Authorization**

Upon addition of a new payment method or each pet care service request, Wag! may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the pet care service charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior.  The authorization is not a charge; however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle.  Should the amount of the authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your credit, debit, or prepaid card.  Wag! cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.

Wag! reserves the right to request additional information from you if we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that a payment method may be fraudulent.

**8\. Acceptable Use of the Services**

**9\. User Content**

The Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send, or receive data, information, and content (“**User Content**”).  You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that User Content.  In other words, you own your personal data.

When you upload, submit, store, send, or receive User Content to or through the Services, you give us permission to reproduce and use your User Content as follows: you grant to us and those we work with a license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (including, but not limited to, translations, adaptations, or other changes we make so that User Content works better with the Services), publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute your User Content in order to operate, promote, market, and improve our Services. Our license to your User Content is non-exclusive, meaning you may use the User Content for your own purposes or let others use your User Content for their purposes.  This license is irrevocable, sublicensable, fully-paid, and royalty free, meaning we do not owe you anything else in connection with our use of your User Content.  We may exercise our rights under this license anywhere in the world.  Lastly, this license is perpetual, meaning that our rights under this license continue even after you stop using the Services.  In general, however, we will only need to use your User Content for as long as you choose to store it with us using the Services.

You promise that:

* you own all rights to your User Content or, alternatively, that you have the right to give us the rights described above (including having the necessary consents and releases from any individuals who appear or whose pets appear in your User Content); and
* your User Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party.

We may refuse to accept or transmit User Content for any reason.  We reserve the right to use, share, and display your User Content (including Pet Owners’ reviews of Pet Care Providers) or Pet Care Providers’ reviews of Pet Owners or their pet(s) in any manner in connection with our business without attribution to you or your approval.  You acknowledge and agree that we are distributors (without any obligation to verify) and not publishers of your User Content or Pet Care Providers’ reviews, and we reserve the right to monitor, screen, edit, or remove your User Content or Pet Care Providers’ reviews in the event that such content include obscenities or other objectionable content, include an individual’s name or other personal information, or violate any privacy laws, other applicable laws, or Company’s content policies.  Our failure to enforce our rights under these Terms in one instance does not create a waiver of our right to enforce them in another instance.  We are not obligated to provide you with copies of your User Content, nor will we have any liability to you for any deletion, disclosure, loss, or modification to your User Content.

If you include your name, image, likeness or voice in any of your User Content, you grant us permission to use your name, image, voice, and likeness, and hereby release us from any liability arising from such use, including, without limitation, claims for invasion of privacy, infringement of your right of publicity, and defamation (including libel and slander).

Wag! offers an in-app chat feature to better connect Pet Owners with Pet Care Providers. Data, information, and content sent through the chat feature is User Content that is subject to these Terms.  We are able to access this User Content and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor, screen, edit, or remove your User Content.  Users should be mindful when communicating information to third parties, and we recommend that you refrain from disclosing or sending sensitive information through the chat feature, such as personal financial information, log-in account information, passwords, and/or personal contact information (including phone numbers).

The Services may provide the ability to leave public and/or private reviews of users or their pets.  You acknowledge that even private reviews may be shared with third parties in accordance with applicable law and our Privacy Policy and that Wag! has no obligation to preserve or indefinitely store any reviews. If you are a Pet Care Provider, we have no obligation to provide you with the content of any reviews about you submitted by other users of the Services, whether before or after termination of your account for the Services.  We will have no liability to you for any deletion, disclosure, loss, or modification of these reviews.  We reserve the right to screen, edit, or remove these reviews from the Services at any time.

**10\. Consent to Pet Care Provider Photo and Video Activities**

As a Pet Owner, you understand and agree that certain Pet Care Providers may take pictures or videos or otherwise create recorded media of you or your pet during the course of providing services to you.  You also understand and agree that during the course of a service you or your pet may participate in recorded media. You further understand and agree that Pet Care Providers may post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide any such pictures, videos, or other forms of recorded media to Wag! through the Services or to their own social media, the Internet, or otherwise.  You understand and agree that such recorded media may be used not only to provide information to you as part of the Services, but also to assist Wag! in quality control, safety, and promotional and marketing activities.  You agree that you have no right, title, or other ownership interest to or in such pictures, videos, or other forms of recorded media, and that the use of such media, including the posting or display of such media, is within Wag!’s and Pet Care Providers’ sole discretion.  Wag! hereby grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to copy and use pictures, videos, and other forms of recorded media of your pet that are made available by Wag! through the Wag! Services, solely for non-commercial purposes (e.g., posting a photo on your social media accounts).

**11\. Pet Owner Obligations**

As a Pet Owner, you hereby represent, covenant, and warrant to Wag! and each Pet Care Provider who provides you with pet care services that: (1) the pet(s) that you request pet care services for are your own; (2) your pets are free from fleas, ticks, and other pests; (3) you have divulged any material information about your pets, including pre-existing medical conditions and other behavioral issues that may be relevant to or impact a Pet Care Provider’s ability to provide the Services; (4) you will have your pets fully vaccinated and up-to-date on all forms of preventative medicine prior to receiving services from a Pet Care Provider; (5) you will comply with all laws and ordinances applicable to your activities conducted through the Services, including ensuring your pet is licensed as required by local law; and (6) the pet(s) for which you are seeking services are not dangerous or otherwise likely to injure others.  If you elect to use the Services, you agree to provide accurate information about yourself and your pet and keep this information up-to-date, including any material information or medical data of your pet.

You acknowledge and agree that if you allow another person to access your account or if you request a pet care service for a pet that is not your own, in each case in violation of these Terms, you and such other person will be jointly and severally liable for all acts and omissions in connection with engaging the Services, including all costs incurred or associated with such engagement.

You are fully responsible for the actions of your pet(s).  You understand, acknowledge and agree that, as between you and Wag!, you shall be liable for any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs) of any kind or nature, arising from or relating to, the behavior of your pet(s), including without limitation, claims by third parties (including Pet Care Providers) for damage, loss, or injuries resulting from bites or attacks on such third parties by your pet(s).  Incidents, injury, damage, or loss caused by your pet may be governed by applicable state liability laws.  Wag! will cooperate with appropriate law enforcement authorities to provide requested information regarding the situation.  If you elect to use a Pet Care Provider through the Services, you shall carry applicable liability insurance sufficient for the pet care services you request, the risks associated with such services, and as mandated by law.  Be sure to review your applicable policy(ies) and address any questions regarding appropriate liability coverage with your insurance carrier and/or legal representatives prior to utilizing a Pet Care Provider through the Services.

You may purchase or request a lockbox to store a key for entrance to your home or apartment for use in connection with the Services.  You understand, acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss, claims, or damages you may suffer as a result of your use of the lockbox, including situations where the lockbox may be illegally accessed by a third party.

You understand and agree that any Pet Care Provider from whom you may seek or obtain pet care services via the Services is an independent contractor, and not a partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of Wag!.  Pet Care Providers have no ability or authority to represent Wag! or otherwise make statements or commitments on Wag!’s behalf.

Pet Care Providers have the sole and absolute discretion to reject or refuse any pet care services that you may request, including if they violate any law or regulation, are dangerous or unsafe, or otherwise violate these Terms or the Additional Terms.  If you, in your sole discretion, choose to provide equipment to Pet Care Providers, Pet Care Providers have the right to refuse a pet care service that involves a retractable leash, which can be dangerous for pets and Pet Care Providers alike, and may cause a safety hazard.  You acknowledge and agree that you will assume all liability in connection with providing a retractable leash.  In addition, we encourage Pet Owners to request only on-leash services.  Please note that for safety reasons, puppies, kittens, or other pets that are six (6) months or younger may be restricted from certain types of services offered via the Wag! platform or be subject to limited service offerings tailored specifically to young pets.

Pet Owners who arrange for pet care services and fail to retrieve their pet within three (3) days after the service period (or an earlier period required under applicable animal abandonment or cruelty laws) agree that Wag! (or the Pet Care Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care and/or notify animal control authorities.  Pet Owner agrees to reimburse Wag! and/or the Pet Care Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions.  Furthermore, Wag! expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner’s pet from a Pet Care Provider’s care should Wag! deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Pet Care Provider, or any third parties. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Pet Care Provider, Wag! will use reasonable efforts during its normal business hours to contact the Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner’s emergency or trusted contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care.  Should Wag! not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, Wag! will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve his/her pet. If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Wag! in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet.  In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Wag! in connection with such transfer.

If your Pet Care Provider or Wag! reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you waive, release, and promise never to assert any claims or causes of action arising from failure to seek such care, whether or not known at the time of such refusal, against Wag! or its predecessors, successors, past or present subsidiaries, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, attorneys, agents, assigns, or the applicable Pet Care Provider with respect to any matter, including (without limitation) any claims of negligence, emotional distress, fraud, breach of contract, or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  You expressly waive and release any and all rights and benefits under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (or any analogous law of any other state), which reads as follows: “**A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.**”  In the unlikely case that your pet needs immediate medical attention or veterinary care, you hereby authorize your Pet Care Provider and Wag! to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation.  Pet Owners are solely responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for your pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize Wag! to charge any of your payment methods for such costs.

As a Pet Owner, you acknowledge that Wag! is in the business of connecting Pet Owners and Pet Care Providers, and that said business is how Wag! earns its income.  As a result, Pet Owner agrees that if Pet Owner solicits a Pet Care Provider to provide off-platform pet care services to Pet Owner whom Pet Owner first met and/or learned about through the Wag! platform, Wag! is entitled to charge both the Pet Owner and the Pet Care Provider a referral fee.  This referral fee will be charged once per specific Pet Owner/Pet Care Provider services relationship utilized outside of the process provided for within the Wag! platform. Pet Owner’s referral fee will be $1,000.  Pet Owner will first be notified in writing of Pet Owner’s obligation to pay the referral fee.  Thereafter, Pet Owner hereby authorizes Wag! to charge any of your payment methods for the referral fee.

After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within ten (10) days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content that was removed or disabled.  If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material.

20.2 Disclaimer of Professional Advice; No Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship

The Services relating to pet health (the “**Health Related Services**”) are provided for informational purposes only.  The Health Related Services do not provide medical or veterinary advice or any medical, veterinary, healthcare, or wellness service.  The Health Related Services are not a substitute for the professional judgement of a veterinary or other medical professional and are not in any way intended to substitute for or override professional veterinary advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  Always seek the advice of your veterinarian or other qualified health provider with any question you may have regarding a pet’s medical condition. If you think your pet may have a medical emergency, call your veterinarian, animal control, PETA, or 911 for help immediately.

You also acknowledge and agree that communications on or through the Health Related Services, including without limitation, User Content, whether with content providers or other users, are at your own risk and are not covered by any privilege or confidentiality obligation that might apply if you were to obtain your own professional advice (e.g., veterinarian-pet).

No matter the qualifications of the person answering your question, by using the Health Related Services, including but not limited to, “Ask a vet” and live digital consultations, you expressly acknowledge that the Health Related Service is NOT a substitute for veterinary care (whether emergency or otherwise), and you further acknowledge that we, the veterinarians, and the Pet Care Providers cannot provide advice or consultation over the internet regarding any specific medical condition (whether of an emergency nature, or otherwise) without a thorough and proper physical evaluation of the pet.  In addition, the quality of the responses provided by the veterinarians and Pet Care Providers will be influenced directly by the quality of the question asked (and the completeness and accuracy of the information conveyed by the person asking the question), of which we, the veterinarians, and the Pet Care Providers have no control.  If your pet is sick, injured, or otherwise in need of medical attention, you agree to contact your regular veterinarian or local emergency provider of veterinary services immediately, as neither Wag! nor the Health Related Services is the appropriate venue to deal with such situations.

You also expressly acknowledge and agree that in the case where one of the Pet Care Providers who is a licensed veterinarian answers your question(s), a veterinarian-client patient relationship is NOT and will NOT be established, and that the Health Related Services will NOT be able to diagnose, treat, or prescribe any medication for your pet.  You further acknowledge that the laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices, and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending upon your location or upon the information that typically would be discovered through in-person (or in-pet) evaluations or visits.  By using the Health Related Services, you understand that any licensed veterinarian that answers your question(s) is NOT your pet’s veterinarian, and that the information they provide to you is NOT a substitute for in-person veterinary diagnosis and/or treatment.  Please be advised that nothing transmitted to or via the Health Related Services constitutes the establishment of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship between you (or your pet) and any professional.

We highly recommend that you always seek the advice of your veterinarian or other qualified provider with any questions that you may have regarding your pet’s medical condition, and that you do not disregard their advice (or delay seeking their advice) because of something that you have read or otherwise been provided through the Health Related Services.

20.3 Disclaimer of Insurance Entity Status

Wag! and Wag! Wellness are not licensed insurance entities and do not offer, administer, solicit, market, sell, underwrite, or in any way engage in the business of insurance.  All insurance products are offered and administered by independent third-party insurance providers.  Wag! and Wag! Wellness make no representations or warranties about the accuracy or completeness of content available on the insurance products or sites linked from this webpage.  The information you see on the Wag! Wellness information portal may be different from what you see when you visit a pet insurance provider or specific pet insurance site. When evaluating offers, please review the insurance provider’s Terms and Conditions. 

**21\. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Wag! and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs) of any kind or nature, arising from or relating to, any (i) actual or alleged breach of these Terms or the Additional Terms by you or anyone using your account, including claims arising from a breach of any of the Pet Owner Obligations set forth in these Terms or Additional Terms; (ii) transactions, interactions or disputes with other users of the Services, whether online or offline; (iii) your misstatements, omissions, misrepresentations, or violation of applicable law; (iv) any of Your Content; (v) any text messages or other communications that you initiate to other Users or to third parties through our Services; and (vi) the actions of your pet(s), including any property damage or personal injury to third parties caused by your pet or pets under your care.  YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU WILL COOPERATE WITH US IN THE DEFENSE AND INVESTIGATION OF SUCH CLAIMS. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS SECTION, AND YOU WILL NOT SETTLE ANY SUCH CLAIM OR MATTER WITHOUT OUR PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT.

**[22\. Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights](#arbitration)**

For purposes of this Section 22 (“**Arbitration Agreement**”), references to “Wag!” include our Affiliates.

a. **Applicability**.  You and Wag! agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of the Services, these Terms, the Additional Terms, your relationship with Wag!, or your receipt of any communications from Wag! will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court to the extent your claims qualify, remain in such court, and advance solely on an individual basis.  “Disputes” or “claims” under this provision shall include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim, or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: the Terms, the Additional Terms and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the Services, any other goods, services, or content made available through the Services, your relationship with Wag!, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation, or termination of your account with Wag!, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions or offers made by Wag!, any communications you receive from Wag!, any claims for fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws, claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act, and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if you are an employee of Wag!, this Arbitration Agreement will not apply to any claims or disputes arising out of your employment relationship with Wag! and any such claims and disputes may be governed by separate agreements.          

b. **Arbitration Rules and Forum**. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration, (2) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim, and (3) a description of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration by you must be delivered to General Counsel, Wag! Labs, Inc., 2261 Market St., Suite 86056, San Francisco, CA 94114, and [legal@wagwalking.com](mailto:legal@wagwalking.com). The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“ **AAA**”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider, and conducted under AAA’s most current version of the Commercial Arbitration Rules and procedures available at [http://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules\_Web.pdf](http://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/CommercialRules_Web.pdf).  AAA’s rules are also available by calling AAA at 800-778-7879. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select a reasonably equivalent alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay  filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees necessary for the arbitration and you cannot obtain a waiver for such fees, Wag! will pay them for you.  In addition, Wag! will reimburse all such filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for proceedings involving claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  Wag! will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in person, or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

c. **Authority of Arbitrator.**  The arbitrator -- not a court -- shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement), (ii) resolve any  dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement), including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, and (iii) resolve any disputes or controversies regarding or arising out of the applicability of these Terms, the Additional Terms, the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement, and/or any other concurrent agreement, to any particular claim or dispute, consistent with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rule R-7 (or similar rule if not arbitrated by the AAA).  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Wag!.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement).  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Wag!.

d. **Waiver of Jury Trial.**  YOU AND WAG! HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

e. **Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.**  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS; ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE PARTY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER PARTY.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the federal or state court located in Santa Clara County, California for adjudication before a judge, not a jury.  All other claims shall be arbitrated.

f. **30-Day Right to Opt Out.**  You have the right to opt out of the provisions of these Terms that mandate arbitration by e-mailing a written notice of your decision to opt out to: [optout@wagwalking.com](mailto:optout@wagwalking.com), within 30 days after first becoming subject to a version of these Terms containing an arbitration provision. Your notice must include your name and address, your Wag! username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Wag! account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.  If you opt out of arbitration, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  With the sole exception of the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement if you are a Pet Care Provider, opting out of arbitration has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with Wag!.  If you are a Pet Care Provider, a timely opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in these Terms will also apply to the Mutual Arbitration Provision of the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement, provided that the opt out would be timely under the terms of the Pet Care Provider Platform Use Agreement as well.

g. **Survival of Arbitration Agreement.**  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Wag!.

h. **Modification**.  Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Wag! makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by emailing Wag! a notice of your rejection to [optout@wagwalking.com](mailto:optout@wagwalking.com).  Your rejection of any such changes shall not affect the enforceability of any prior version of this Arbitration Agreement, or of any other agreement to arbitrate, that you previously entered into with Wag!.

**23\. Other Provisions**

Under no circumstances will Wag! be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.  In the event the Arbitration Agreement above is found not to apply to you or a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California.  You and Wag! consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.  

YOU AND WAG! HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES, THESE TERMS, THE ADDITIONAL TERMS, YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WAG!, OR YOUR RECEIPT OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS WITH WAG!.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.  The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver and will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.

We may freely assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.  You may not assign any rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of Wag! and any purported assignment in violation of this provision shall be null and void.
