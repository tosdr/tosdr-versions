#### 1\. Information We Collect Online

We collect Personally Identifiable Information from you through your use of the Sites and Services. “Personally Identifiable Information” is individually identifiable information about an individual consumer that we collect online and that we maintain in an accessible form.

#### 4\. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

**How We Use Cookies**  
Like many other companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “Cookies”). Cookies are small files of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer hard drive, mobile or other devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets).

We use Cookies to:

* Estimate audience size and usage patterns;
* Understand and save your preferences for future visits, allowing us to customize the Sites and Services to your individual needs;
* Advertise new content and services that relate to your interests;
* Keep track of advertisements and search engine results;
* Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions to resolve issues and offer better site experiences and tools in the future; and
* Recognize when you return to the Sites.

We set some Cookies ourselves, while separate entities set other Cookies. We use Cookies other entities set to provide us with useful information, to help us improve our Sites and Services, to conduct advertising, and to analyze the effectiveness of advertising. For example, we use Cookies from Google and other similar companies.

**How You Can Opt Out of Cookies**

_Your Preferences_  
When you first visit our Site, we will present you with a banner which offers you choices about whether to accept or reject cookies or tracking technologies of different types. If you wish to change your preferences, you can do so by clicking here:  
Cookie Settings  
This will allow you to change your preferences on Transdevna.com. If you wish to change your preferences on one of our other Sites, you can do so by clicking on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link included in the footer of that Site.

_Browser Settings_  
You can block Cookies by changing your Internet browser settings to refuse all or some Cookies. If you choose to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Site.

You can find out more about Cookies and how to manage them by visiting [www.AboutCookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

_Platform Controls_  
You can opt out of Cookies set by Google by following the instructions found at this link: [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/).

_Advertising Industry Resources_  
You can understand which entities have currently enabled Cookies for your browser or mobile device and how to opt out of some of those Cookies by accessing the [Network Advertising Initiative’s website](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s website](http://optout.aboutads.info/). For more information on mobile specific opt-out choices, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Mobile Choices website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices).

Please note these opt-out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised. Therefore, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.

**Google Analytics**  
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses Cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with the Sites and Services, compile reports on their activity, and provide other services related to their activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor, and any referring website. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to [Google’s privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google, [click here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

**Google reCAPTCHA**  
We use Google reCAPTCHA, a free service provided by Google, Inc., to protect our Sites from spam and abuse. Google reCAPTCHA uses advanced risk analysis techniques to decipher humans and bots. Google reCAPTCHA works differently depending on what version is deployed. For example, you may be asked to check a box indicating that you are not a robot or Google reCAPTCHA may detect abusive traffic without user interaction. Google reCAPTCHA works by transmitting certain types of information to Google, such as the referrer URL, IP address, visitor behavior, operating system information, browser and length of the visit, cookies, and mouse movements. Your use of Google reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms). More information as to Google reCAPTCHA and how it works is [available here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha).

#### 5\. “Do Not Track” Signals

Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, the Sites do not currently interpret, respond to, or alter their practices when they receive “Do Not Track” signals.

#### 6\. Choices About Your Personally Identifiable Information

**Review and Request Changes to Your Personally Identifiable Information**  
You may use your account to access, correct, or view certain Personally Identifiable Information we have collected and which is associated with your account. To review or request changes to any of your Personally Identifiable Information, please contact us at [infoUS@transdev.com](mailto:infoUS@transdev.com).

**Marketing Communications**  
To unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please click the unsubscribe link included in the footer of our emails. You also may submit a request to us at [infoUS@transdev.com](mailto:infoUS@transdev.com).

#### 7\. Security

We maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personally Identifiable Information we collect and store from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

#### 8\. Third Party Links

The Sites and Services may contain links that will let you leave the Sites and Services and access another website. Linked websites are not under our control. Except as stated below, this Privacy Policy applies solely to Personally Identifiable Information that is acquired by us on our Sites and Services. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.

#### 9\. Children’s Privacy

The Sites and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under 13.

#### 10\. Notice to California Residents

The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”), requires that we provide California residents with a privacy policy that contains a comprehensive description of our online and offline practices regarding the collection, use, sale, sharing, and retention of personal information and of the rights of California residents regarding their personal information. This section of the Privacy Policy is intended solely for, and is applicable only as to, California residents. If you are not a California resident, this section does not apply to you and you should not rely on it.

The CCPA defines “personal information” to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household. Personal information does not include publicly available, deidentified or aggregated information or lawfully obtained, truthful information that is a matter of public concern. For purposes of this “Notice to California Residents” section we will refer to this information as “Personal Information.”

The CCPA, including the consumer rights described in this section, however, does not apply to any protected health information that we in our capacity as a business associate governed by the privacy, security, and breach notification rules issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services established pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. We will use that information only for the purposes for which we were engaged by the HIPAA covered entity.

If you are a California resident and a current or former employee, job applicant, or independent contractor of ours, please see our [privacy notice available here](https://transdevna.com/california-employee-privacy-policy/) for more information on our collection and use of your Personal Information in that capacity.

You may submit a request to know, delete, and/or correct through our interactive webform [available here](https://transdevnaitccpa.powerappsportals.com/CCPA-Form/), by emailing us at [infoUS@transdev.com](mailto:infoUS@transdev.com), or by calling us toll free at 1-800-225-8880.

If you are submitting a request on behalf of a California resident, please submit the request through one of the designated methods discussed above. After submitting the request, we will require additional information to verify your authority to act on behalf of the California resident.

_Our Process for Verifying a Request to Know, Delete, and/or Correct_  
If we determine that your request is not subject to an exemption or exception, we will comply with your request upon verification of your identity and, to the extent applicable, the identity of the California resident on whose behalf you are making such request. We will verify your identity either to a “reasonable degree of certainty” or a “reasonably high degree of certainty” depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the risk of harm to you by unauthorized disclosure, deletion, or correction as applicable.

For requests to access categories of Personal Information and for requests to delete or correct Personal Information that is not sensitive and does not pose a risk of harm by unauthorized deletion or correction, we will verify your identity to a “reasonable degree of certainty” by verifying at least two data points that you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities.

For requests to access specific pieces of Personal Information or for requests to delete or correct Personal Information that is sensitive and poses a risk of harm by unauthorized deletion or correction, we will verify your identity to a “reasonably high degree of certainty” by verifying at least three pieces of Personal Information you previously provided to us and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying identities. In addition, you must submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the individual whose Personal Information is being requested.

**Right to Opt Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information**  
If you are a California resident, you have the right to direct us to stop selling or sharing your Personal Information.  
You may submit a request to opt out of sales or sharing through our interactive webform available by clicking on this link:

This will allow you to opt out of sales or sharing on Transdevna.com. If you would like to exercise this opt-out right on one of our other Sites, you can do so by clicking on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link included in the footer of that Site.

If you have enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we will also treat that as a valid request to opt out. To opt out of our use of third-party advertising Cookies, please see the section “How You Can Opt Out of Cookies” above.

**Shine the Light Law**
