This enables us to collect and evaluate information about your activities on our website. We carry out this web analysis with both our own web analysis tools as well as those from web analysis and optimization service providers.

#### Jimdo's web analysis technology

When you access our website and have been informed accordingly, we collect information about your use of our website using a web analysis tool we developed and store this in a pseudonymous profile. This allows us to improve our website. Jimdo's web analysis tool logs your email address and the user agent, collates these together, and truncates and stores this data using the hash function. A visitor identifier is generated in this way. We also encrypt the visitor identifier using a random value, the salt, which changes every 24 hours. In doing so we ensure that your IP address cannot be restored from the visitor identifiers stored by us and you cannot be personally identified. We do not consolidate this data with other data and it is only stored on our server.

Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.

#### Web analysis technology from web analysis service providers and optimization service providers

When you access our website and have given us your consent, we collect information about your use of our website using web analysis tools from web analysis service providers and optimization service providers and store this in a device profile. This allows improving our website and the objectives of our website. A unique ID is allocated to your device which is linked to the device profile in order to assign this information to your device. This data is stored in cookies on your device (see our ) and may be read when you visit our website. During your visit to our website, we may recognize your device on the basis of the ID that was allocated to it. The aim of the analysis is to discover where the users of our website come from, what areas of our website they visit, and how often and how long they view which pages and categories. The IP address is rendered anonymous prior to storage. To document your consent we store a unique ID that is allocated to your device for the duration of your consent.

We process **web analysis HTTP data**, **web analysis device data,** and **web analysis data**.

The web analysis tool we use generates and stores the web analysis profile. This includes information about your use of our website, in particular pages, accessed, frequency of access, and time spent on the accessed pages, plus the unique ID assigned to your device.

### V. Marketing

We process your personal data for the purposes of sending you a personalized newsletter, recognizing you on another website, tracking the success of our ads (conversion tracking), showing you targeted advertising for our products ((re)targeting), and for surveys.

Detailed information about this can be found below:

#### Personalized newsletter

You can register for our email newsletter on our website. We also send the newsletter to our customers. Our newsletter provides you with information about Jimdo's products, services and promotions, surveys, prize draws, blog articles, and other similar content. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time using the unsubscribe link contained in every newsletter. We process certain data in connection with this when we send and analyze the success of our newsletter.

We may reconstruct individual functionalities (such as using behavioral data) of our newsletter to understand which content in our newsletter is particularly interesting to Jimdo users. We will only use the results of these analyses for the purposes of improving our services and designing our services to better meet your requirements as well as for targeting purposes. The newsletter, therefore, contains a "web beacon", which is a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server, or, if applicable, the server of an analysis service provider when the newsletter is opened. Technical information, such as browser and system information, as well as IP address and the time of the retrieval is collected as part of this process. This information is used to improve the technical performance of our services using the technical data, or the target groups and reading behavior based on the access location (which can be determined using the IP address), or the time of access. Statistical data that is also collected includes determining whether the newsletter has been opened when it was opened, how long it was opened for, and which links were clicked on. From a technical perspective, it may be possible to assign this information to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is not our goal to analyze individual users. Rather, these analyses help us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to our users, or to send them different content in accordance with their interests.

You may object to or withdraw your consent to the storage and usage of your data for sending the newsletter at any time with future effect without needing to give reasons, without being penalized in any way, and without paying any cost for this other than the transmission costs for sending the objection/withdrawal. This can be done by clicking the unsubscribe link in the newsletter, which can be found at the end of every newsletter. Alternatively, you can deselect the "Newsletter" box in your customer account.

Your consent to statistical analysis will also be withdrawn at the same time. It is unfortunately not possible to just object to the statistical analysis in our newsletter. The lawfulness of the data processing operations remains unaffected by the withdrawal of your consent. In the event that you withdraw your consent, the personal data used for this data processing will be anonymized or erased. Data that we store for other purposes (such as email addresses for the member area) is not affected by this.

We process **contact data, newsletter form HTTP data, newsletter subscription data, newsletter tracking pixel data, and newsletter profile data.**

The legal basis for sending the newsletter in conjunction with a purchase of Jimdo's goods or services is Art. 13 (2) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC.). It is also possible to send the Jimdo newsletter on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO).

We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Newsletter dispatch service providers, newsletter analysis service providers. We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.

Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.

#### Using conversion tracking

We use conversion tracking technology on our website if you have given your consent. Conversions are certain user activities defined by us on our website. Conversion tracking is a method for us to gauge what happens after you have interacted with our ads in search engines or on other websites. For example, we can see whether you subsequently carried out a certain action on our website.

If you are shown our ads in search engines or on other websites or you interact with our adverts we can gather information from this and store it in a device profile. A unique ID is allocated to your device in order to assign this information to your device. We can then link this with your device profile. This ID can be stored using cookies (see our ). This processing takes place, if applicable, dependent on your consent given to the respective operator of the website.

If you subsequently visit our website we can read the information stored in these cookies. We can recognize your device in this manner using the ID and retrieve the information stored in the device profile about you viewing our ads, as well as storing further data there. This allows us to record information about the use of our website, in particular any conversions that occur. We can thereby see which keywords, ads, groups of ads, and ad campaigns resulted in the desired actions from users. In addition, we can understand what our return on investment (ROI) is and make informed decisions about our advertising costs. We can also automatically optimize our advertising campaigns in line with our business goals.

We process **conversion HTTP data, conversion device data, and conversion profile data.**

The legal basis for processing is your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You may withdraw your consent at any time via our .

We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Conversion tracking providers.

We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.

Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.

#### Remarketing technology

We use remarketing technology on our website if you have given your consent. Remarketing (also called retargeting) means that we can retarget users who have already interacted with our website (with ads in search engines or on other websites that share the same advertising network as us, for example).

When you access our website we collect information about your use of our website and this is stored in a device profile. A unique ID is allocated to your device which is linked to the device profile in order to assign this information to your device. This ID is stored in cookies (see our ) on your device. If you subsequently use search engines or visit other websites that share the same advertising network as us on the same device, your device may be recognized on the basis of the ID that was allocated to it. The stored information about the use of our website can be accessed using this ID, including allocating your device profile to certain advertising segments. The provider of the remarketing tool used by us can target our ads shown to you in this manner. This processing takes place, if applicable, dependent on your consent given to the respective operator of the website.

When you visit search engines or other websites that share the same advertising network as us, the provider of the remarketing tool used by us can store information about the use of the search engine or other information about the ads that you have been shown or interacted with in the device profile in order to enable better personalization. In addition, the enrichment of the profile carried out by the provider of the remarketing tool used by us enables the placement of various adverts to be optimized for us and other companies for whom they place ads (monitoring the frequency of the incorporation of certain ads, for example).

Your ads are personalized and specifically aimed at you by us and the provider of the remarketing tool used by us using your device profile, in particular your usage of our website. We analyze the information stored in your profile and assign your profile to certain advertising segments on this basis.

We process **remarketing HTTP data, remarketing device data, and remarketing profile data.**

The legal basis for processing is your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You may withdraw your consent at any time via our .

We transfer your data to the following categories of recipient as part of this processing: Remarketing providers.

We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.

Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.

#### Surveys about our services

You have the option to answer surveys about our services on our website (in particular about customer satisfaction). These surveys allow us to improve and optimize our products and services. We may also invite you to take part in such surveys by email (in the newsletter, for example).

We process **survey data, HTTP data, registration data, and log-in data.**

The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest in improving our services (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). If you no longer wish to receive support feedback requests you can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in every newsletter. We also analyze the queries dealt with by our Customer Support team to improve our customer support.

We transfer your data to the following categories of recipients as part of this processing: Opinion survey providers.

We transfer your personal data to processors in the USA for these purposes. You can find information about the transfer of personal data to third countries in Section C.

Information about the length of time for which the various categories of personal data are stored can be found in Section D.

### Applicant Data

We process data supplied by applicants as part of the application process. This includes the following information: Name, address, telephone and cell numbers, email addresses, and the personal data contained within the application documents. We only process applications if they have been entered into our recruiting system. This is the case where the applicant has applied to us via our Careers website. If the applicant applies to us via another path that we had not specified (such as by email), we will transfer the data into the system. The applicant then receives automatic confirmations of receipt, invitations, and rejections via the system. We process the data purely for the purposes of handling the application. Applicant data is (re)processed in accordance with Art. 88 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in conjunction with section 26 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and, in the event of a rejection, is automatically erased after 6 months. In the event that the applicant has consented to the further storage of their personal data, we will transfer the data to our pool of applicants. The applicant may contact their contact within the HR department to erase their applicant account and the data held within it earlier than this. The data there is automatically erased after a period of two years. For more information, please go to our [Jimdo Careers page](https://careers.jimdo.com/).

C. Data transmission to third countries
---------------------------------------

Jimdo ensures that your data is processed in the EU or in the European Economic Area. Should this no longer be possible and data needs to be transferred to a third country, Jimdo will ensure, after prior review, that an adequate level of data protection that meets the requirements of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the EU Commission is adhered to in the country the data is transferred to.

In these cases, the data is transferred on the basis of an Adequacy Decision of the European Commission or the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transmission of personal data to third countries in its currently valid version. These can be accessed here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004D0915.

Data transmission to a third country may also take place on the basis of your consent. You will be provided with details of this separately, if applicable.

D. Storage duration of your personal data
-----------------------------------------

We store your personal data for various reasons (such as technical reasons and legal reasons) for different durations. Generally, we only store your data for as long as necessary for the respective purpose or where we are contractually or legally obligated to store the data for a longer period.

We store HTTP data and server log files for a maximum of three (3) months unless there is a security incident (such as a DDoS attack). In the event of a security incident, server log files will be stored until the incident has been rectified and fully investigated.

Co-browsing session data is generally erased no later than 30 days afterwards.

We store and use the data provided to us by Jimdo users to process contracts. After the contract has been implemented in full or the customer account has been erased, the data will be blocked taking fiscal and legal retention periods into consideration and then erased after the expiry of such periods, provided the Jimdo user has not expressly consented to the further use of their data or where we are permitted by law to further use the data, which the user will be informed about separately.

E. Use of cookies and comparable technology

Information about the use of cookies can be found in our . You can change your settings regarding the use of cookies on our website via our .
