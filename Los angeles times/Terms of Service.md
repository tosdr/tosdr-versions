These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the website, mobile application or other online service where these Terms are posted (collectively, the “Site”). By clicking an Accept, Register or similar button or icon, connecting to the Site through a third party such as Facebook or by accessing, browsing, or using the Site in any manner, you agree to be bound to these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.latimes.com/about/la-privacypolicy-20180703-story.html), whether or not you registered with the Site. All references to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the person who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Site in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors. The Site reserves the right to deny access to any person who violates these Terms. “Site” includes, without limitation, [www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/) and [www.hoylosangeles.com](https://www.hoylosangeles.com/).

**Eligibility**. The Site is intended solely for persons who are 13 or older; however, we are providing some family content during this time of the COVID-19 crisis for parents or guardians who are home with their kids. We shall obtain the consent of a parent or guardian to the extent that the parent’s or guardian’s child under 13 submits personal information to us in connection with such family content.

You may use the Content online only, and solely for your personal, non-commercial use, and you may download or print a single copy of any portion of the Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use, provided you do not remove any trademark, copyright or other notice from such Content.

The Site is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas provided to the Site. If you do transmit unsolicited submissions to us through the Site or otherwise, you grant Los Angeles Times a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and fully sub-licensable license to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, adapt, translate, archive, store, and create derivative works from such submissions, and you understand and agree that such submissions may be adapted, broadcast, changed, copied, disclosed, licensed, performed, posted, published, sold, transmitted, or otherwise used as Los Angeles Times sees fit.

**User Content Screening and Removal.** You acknowledge that the Site and/or its designees may or may not pre-screen User Content, and shall have the right (but not the obligation), in their sole discretion, to move, remove, block, edit, or refuse any User Content for any reason, including without limitation that such User Content violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable.

**User Content Assumption of Risk.** Although the Site may from time to time monitor or review postings, transmissions, and the like on the Site, it cannot and does not monitor or manage all User Content, and does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of User Content. All User Content provided to the Site is the sole responsibility of the person who provided it. **This means that you are entirely responsible for all User Content that you provide.** To protect your safety, please use your best judgment when using Site forums, chat rooms, bulletin boards, blogs or similar features. We discourage divulging personal phone numbers and addresses or other information that can be used to identify or locate you.

**Transactions and E-Commerce.** During your visit to the Site, you may elect to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product such as a newspaper subscription, a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods and services. Credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third-party processing agent, bank or distribution institution.

If you are concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us and place your order by phone.

Under no circumstances will the Site be liable for any goods, services, resources or content available through such third-party dealings or communications, or for any harm related thereto. Please review carefully that third party’s policies and practices and make sure you are comfortable with them before you engage in any transaction.

MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
---------------------------------------------

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

You and Los Angeles Times agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.

This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. **The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.**

By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Los Angeles Times as follows:

**Initial Dispute Resolution.** Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach our Customer Support Department at [termsofservice@latimes.com](mailto:termsofservice@latimes.com). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with our Customer Support Department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Within sixty (60) days after either side has provided notice of a dispute, the party that has provided the notice shall request a remote settlement conference (via telephone or video conference service such as Zoom) that requires personal participation of each party (you and the Los Angeles Times) and, if represented, each party’s counsel.

**Binding Arbitration.** If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may submit the matter to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for mediation, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, it shall be submitted to AAA for binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ or Privacy Policy’s formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by AAA in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and, if applicable, the Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) ); (b) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to AAA Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 (or through AAA WebFile® located at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/), or at any AAA office); and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Los Angeles Times at 2300 E. Imperial Highway, ATTENTION: LEGAL, El Segundo, CA 90245.

To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Los Angeles Times will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Los Angeles Times will pay the fees invoiced by AAA, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County in the State of California, United States of America, and you and Los Angeles Times agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

**Class Action Waiver.** The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. **YOU AND LOS ANGELES TIMES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes on a class basis.

**Exception.** _Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:_Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

**30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to [termsofservice@latimes.com](mailto:termsofservice@latimes.com) with the subject line, “MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (a) the Effective Date of these Terms; or (b) the first date that you used the Site that contained any versions of the Terms that included this version of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver, whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Los Angeles Times also will not be bound by them.

**Changes to This Section**. Any changes to this section will be made in the same manner as described in the Modifying these Terms section above; however, such changes will only become effective sixty (60) days after the revised Effective Date of these Terms and only will apply prospectively to claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Site.

**Survival.** This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Site.

**Severability.** If for any reason any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected in that provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.
