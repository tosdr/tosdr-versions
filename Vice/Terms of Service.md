REPORTING COPYRIGHT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY VIOLATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------

You may not use the Sites for any purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party. Vice encourages you to report any content on the Sites that you believe infringes your rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you have a good faith belief that content on the Sites infringe your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below.

In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"), Vice has a designated agent for receiving notices of copyright infringement and Vice follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Vice's copyright agent the following information required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. 512: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement must be sent to VICE's licensing team:

Email: [licensing@vice.com](mailto:licensing@vice.com)

  
Mailing Address:

Brooklyn, NY 11249  
Attention: Copyright/Trademark Licensing Team

**Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying VICE of claims that your copyrighted material or other intellectual property has been infringed.**

We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers.

It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.

Vice will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third party complaint of alleged infringement of the third party's intellectual property rights.

INFORMATION/CONTENT YOU SUBMIT
------------------------------

The Sites may provide you and others with the opportunity to participate in message boards, chat rooms and other public areas ("Community Forums") and may provide you with the opportunity, through such features or otherwise, to submit, post, display, transmit, perform, publish, distribute or broadcast content and materials to Vice or a Site, including, without limitation, comments, ideas, review, suggestions and other content (collectively, "User Content").

Except as otherwise described in the Privacy Policy, or applicable Additional Terms, you agree that your User Content will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will not be returned.

You remain the owner of your User Content, but you acknowledge that Vice must have a license from you in order to accept your User Content. You grant to Vice the unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free right and license to host, use, copy, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sub-license, display, perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, modify and create derivative works of, reformat, translate, archive, store, cache or otherwise exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User Content for any purpose whatsoever in all formats; on or through any media, software, formula or medium now known or later developed; and with any technology or devices now known or later developed and to advertise, market and promote the same.

You further agree that Vice is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in any User Content you send to the Sites or Vice, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and or services using such User Content; or creating informational articles based on or advertising our products and services, and without obligation, remuneration or attribution of any kind to you or anyone else. You further perpetually and irrevocably grant Vice the unconditional right to use and exploit your name, persona and likeness included in any User Content and in connection with any User Content, without any obligation, remuneration or attribution of any kind to you or anyone else. You further authorize Vice to publish your User Content in a searchable format that may be accessed by users of the Sites and the Internet. Except as prohibited by law, you waive any moral rights you may have in any User Content you submit, even if such User Content is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.

You agree that you either: (i) own the rights to the User Content you submit and the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms; or (ii) you have all necessary rights and licenses from the owner(s) of these rights to enter into these Terms and grant Vice these licenses. Upon Vice's request, you will furnish Vice any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms.

You agree that Vice has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User Content but has the right to protect and enforce its and its rights to your User Content including, without limitation, by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at Vice's cost and expense, to which you agree to consent and irrevocably appoint Vice as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegations, which appointment is coupled with an interest).

You further acknowledge and agree that Vice does not and will not have any obligation to review, monitor, display, accept or exploit any User Content and Vice may, in its sole discretion, delete, move, re-format, edit, alter, distort, remove or refuse to exploit User Content at any time without notice or liability to you or any other party. You understand that User Content need not be maintained on the Site by us for any period of time and we reserve the right to delete it at any time.

All of your User Content is your sole responsibility. This means that you, and not Vice, are entirely responsible for all User Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available via the Sites. If you post personal information to publicly available areas of the Sites then you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any of User Content including, without limitation, any errors or omissions in User Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of User Content.

VIRAL DISTIRBUTION AND WIDGETS
------------------------------

Vice may allow you - but only through express written permission -to engage in certain personal uses of Materials that include the ability to share Materials with others (" **Viral** **Distribution**"). For example, the Site may allow you to send Materials to friends, display Materials on your personal web site or post Materials on a third party web site. We reserve the right to revoke our permission for Viral Distribution at any time and for any reason and you agree to comply with any terms we post in connection the Viral Distribution of Materials.

Similarly, the Site may provide content that you may choose to embed on your personal web page, third party web site or social networking site by pasting the HTML or other code provided by us (typically labeled as an embed code) (" **Widgets**"). Widgets are Materials and subject to the limited, revocable license described above for Materials. We may discontinue providing the services necessary for the Widgets to operate or we may disable Widgets you have embedded at any time for any reason without any liability to you. You agree that our permission to you to use Widgets on your personal web page does not provide you (or any third party) with any intellectual property rights in or to the Widget or any Materials made available via any Widget.

You agree that you will not embed or otherwise make available a Widget on a web page or web site containing content that (i) is threatening, abusive, harassing, , hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable (in Vice's sole opinion). Vice makes no specific warranties about Widgets. You agree not to circumvent (or in any way attempt to circumvent) the security or rights management features in the Widget or any component of the Widget (including any video player) that are designed to prevent users from copying, manipulating or retaining the Materials made available via the Widget. You also agree to not use (or attempt to use) the Widget or any component of the Widget to display content other than the Materials provided or intended by Vice to be displayed via a particular Widget.

NOTICE TO THIRD PARTY SITES: Any Materials made available in connection with your site, or otherwise, by our Widgets, third party widgets or otherwise is our exclusive property and no grant of any intellectual property rights is made by us. We retain the right to demand that you cease any use of our Materials upon notice.

The Sites may offer one time fee-based services and subscription based services. Regardless of the type of service you purchase, you agree to pay all fees and charges that you incur.
