5\. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR DATA COLLECTION AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may disclose non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics and certain usage information, with service providers and other third parties, including third party advertisers, content providers and analytics providers, may themselves collect such information when you visit the Sites. We do not disclose your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes unless you agree to such sharing by opting in. You may opt-out of sharing by clicking the “ Do Not Sell or Share My Info” link. We may disclose the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent (to the extent required by law), and as described in this Privacy Policy.

**When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties Or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information.** You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.

You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances. For example, if you "like" content on our Sites, information about you may transfer to the third party offering that application on our Sites and to the third party web site to which you are posting.

**Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf.** We may use third party service providers to perform certain services on behalf of the Sites, such as hosting the Sites, designing and/or operating the Sites' features, analyzing users' interactions with the Sites, sending communications, safeguarding against fraud, or performing other administrative services. We may provide these service providers with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for the Sites.

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.** We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (a "Promotion") that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.

**Administrative and Legal Reasons.** We may also transfer and disclose user information, including Personal Information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our opinion such disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to protect and/or defend the Sites' [Terms of Use](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html) or other policies applicable to the Sites or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual. To that extent, we may disclose certain Personal Information to a third party we engage to protect against fraud and the unauthorized use of credit and gift cards. We may also use Device Identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. These disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

**Business Transfers.** VICE may share Personal Information with its subsidiaries and affiliates for internal business reasons. VICE also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Sites, including Personal Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Sites or component of the Sites, such as a database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of certain of VICE's ownership interests, assets, or both, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.

You may be able to submit comments, ideas, reviews, suggestions and other content ("User Content") to the Sites and to post your User Content publicly on message boards, chat rooms, and other public areas (collectively, "Community Forums").

_Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public._ Information you choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Content, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover your disclosure of that information or content. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information.

VICE may publish User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or later developed). Subject to applicable law, we may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information with your User Content, and VICE may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit, please review our [Terms of Use](https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html).

Also, if you choose to "like" content on one of the Sites, to tweet from the Sites or to otherwise post information from or via the Sites to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Sites.

8\. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
-----------------------------

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA") provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of Personal Information,

In addition to the rights described above in Section 7, California residents have the following rights:

**_Right to Opt Out of Sale_** – You have the right to opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of your Personal Information. We use your Personal Information for the purposes described in the [Information We Collect](#1) section above, some of which may be considered to be a Sale or Sharing under applicable privacy laws and you may have the right to request to opt-out of such data uses. To exercise this right, please click the “ Do Not Sell or Share My Info” link, call us at +1-888-269-1005, or set your browser Global Privacy Controls to send this signal when you visit our Sites.

**_Right to Limit the use of Sensitive Personal Information_** – The CCPA gives consumers the right to limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only the purposes for which it was collected. We only use Sensitive Personal Information for the purpose for which it was collected, in aggregated and deidentified form to gain insights about our audience, and we do not use it to infer characteristics about you.

**_California Shine the Light_** – Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request, once a year, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information, such as those outlined in Sections 3 and 4, during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and the categories of Personal Information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as VICE does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated below in this Privacy Policy, VICE provides you choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt in or if you choose to opt out at the time VICE offers that choice, VICE does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.

10\. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
-------------------------------------------

Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many websites and online services, VICE does not alter its practices when it receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser.

We will do our best to recognize, process, and honor a GPC Signal that meets the legal standards and is widely adopted in the industry.

12\. DMCA

In order for us to process your notice of copyright infringement, it must be sent to our Designated Agent below. When we receive a notice under this procedure, we will use our best efforts to expeditiously remove or disable access to the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.

In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (DMCA), written notification must be submitted to the following Designated Agent:

Copyright Agent

5. Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Sites may contain content that is hosted and served by third parties, which may include third party widgets (such as those that allow you to share content with third party web sites and online services). The Sites may also contain links to other third party web sites that VICE does not control. In addition, VICE widgets may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with us, and over which we have no control. These third parties may collect information about you through the use of their own cookies and web beacons, may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. VICE is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party.

15\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
-----------------------

The Sites are general audience web sites and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13). We will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from an individual younger than the age of 13. If a parent, guardian or anyone else becomes aware of Personal Information that has been collected from the use of the Sites by an individual under the age of 13, please contact our customer service immediately at [USPrivacy@vice.com](mailto:USPrivacy@vice.com).

16\. TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES
-------------------------------------------------

The Sites are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States where the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen. When we undertake such transfers, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in line with relevant legal requirements including standard contractual clauses approved by the UK and EU regulators.

17\. SECURITY
