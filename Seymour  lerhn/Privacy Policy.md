_This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for website visitors and platform users._

**General**

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

For a better experience while using our Service we may require certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

The online platform may use third party services to track visitor usage of the site to enhance and improve the visitor experience. 

When you visit our site we store the website from which you visited us from, the parts of our site you visit, the date and duration of your visit, and information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit. We only capture and store a truncated version of your IP address. It is captured and stored in an anonymised format by suppressing the last octet so your full IP address never reaches our servers and we never have access to it.

We process this usage data to facilitate your access to our services (e.g. to adjust our services to the device you are using), and to recognise and stop any misuse. We also process usage data in an anonymised form for statistical purposes and to improve our site.

The websites may also contain other tracking technologies such as “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted. 

We operate our ads program in partnership with third party vendors. As part of the operation of our ads program, we use cookies to collect certain information.
