-------------------

In order to collect, use, share, and otherwise process your information for the purposes described in this Notice, we rely on a number of legal bases, some of which are mentioned above, including where:

* necessary to perform a contract we have with you, such as our Terms of Use, and to provide the Services (we refer to this as contractual necessity above);
* you have consented to the processing (in which case you may revoke your consent at any time);
* necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;
* necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of others;
* necessary in the public interest; and
* necessary for the purposes of RANDOM.ORG's or a third party's legitimate interests, such as those of clients and others, provided that those interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms

8\. Legitimate Interests

Where we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process your information based on legitimate interests, we may rely on the following interests:

* **Keeping our Services Safe and Secure:** We use your information in certain instances as necessary to pursue our and your legitimate interests of keeping some of our Services, such as our domains, websites, apps, offices, events, and the integrity of draws and our services generally, safe and secure. For example, we collect IP addresses and process log files to ensure our website and apps are not subject to fraudulent access, and we store data from the [True Random Number Generator widget](https://www.random.org/widgets/integers/) and the [List Randomizer](https://www.random.org/lists/) for three years in order to be able to expose fraud.
* **Marketing our Services:** We use your information as necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in marketing our Services.

9\. Sharing Your Information

In the course of providing the Services, we share information with various third parties, including the host of an event which uses the Services, legal and regulatory authorities and payment service providers.

We do this based upon the legal bases and exceptions mentioned in section 8 of this Notice.

* **Service providers:** We may share your personal information to help us provide our services and communicate with you. Categories of service providers include IT software and hosting providers and records-storage companies. Where such third parties are processors, these third parties are contractually required to use it only to provide their service to us and are contractually barred from using it for their own purposes.
* **Business re-organisation:** In instances where our business is subject to a re-organization, such as a merger or acquisition of some or all of its assets, we may, in accordance with our legitimate interests, need to share information in the course of the transaction. In such circumstances, your information may be disclosed, where permitted by applicable law, in connection with a corporate restructuring, sale, or assignment of assets, merger, or other changes of control or financial status of RANDOM.ORG.

10\. Data Transfers
-------------------

In certain cases, we need to transfer your information to recipients outside the European Economic Area (‘**EEA**’), such as where it is necessary to provide the Services.

Where we transfer your information, we do so in accordance with EU data protection law. We only transfer personal information to these countries when it is necessary for the services we provide you, or it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or subject to safeguards that assure the protection of your information. We may rely on different legal mechanisms to ensure the transfer is lawful. If the recipient is in a country that is not deemed ‘adequate’ by the European Commission, we may enter into the ‘standard contractual clauses’ with the recipient. These are contracts that contain standard commitments approved by the EU Commission protecting the privacy and security of the information transferred.

Please note that the privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in some of these countries may not be the same as in your home country. We will only transfer information as permitted by law.

For further information, including obtaining a copy of the documents used to protect your information, please contact us at [privacy@random.org](mailto:privacy@random.org).

11\. Retention

We may retain your information for as long as necessary in light of the purposes set out in this Notice, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements and, where required for RANDOM.ORG to assert or defend against legal claims, until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We also consider regulatory and guidance issued by the Data Protection Commission.

12\. Your Rights
----------------

You have a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. To exercise these rights, please contact us at [privacy@random.org](mailto:privacy@random.org).

* **Data Portability:** You have the right to request that some of your personal information that you initially provided to us is returned to you or another controller in a commonly used machine readable format.
* **Rectify, Restrict and Delete:** You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information or to rectify or delete your information. Please note that despite a deletion request, we may continue to process your information if we have a legal basis to do so.
* **Object:** If we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest, you can object in certain circumstances. In such cases, where legally required to do so, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons. Where we use your data for direct marketing, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such communications or by contacting us at [privacy@random.org](mailto:privacy@random.org).
* **Revoke Consent:** Where you have previously provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information at any time. For example, you can withdraw your consent to email marketing by using the unsubscribe link in such communications or contacting us at [privacy@random.org](mailto:privacy@random.org). In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.
