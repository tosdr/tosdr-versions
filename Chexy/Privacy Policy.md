What We Collect and How
=======================

We also may combine information that we have about you with additional information that we, or other third parties, collect in other contexts—such as our communications with you via email or phone, your responses to project screening questions, your customer service records, or any feedback provided by a User. In those circumstances, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.  
  
For greater clarity, we may collect the following Personal Information from you:

How Do We Collect Data?

We collect personal data directly from you, from third parties, and through the use of cookies and metadata collected on our Website and Services.  
  
We, and our third-party service providers, collect information automatically through our Services. This may include information such as your IP address and domain name, your Internet service provider, the date and time of your visit, your use of the Services during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), the URLs from the websites you visit before and after navigating to the Services, your computer’s operating system and browser type, your software and hardware attributes (such as device IDs, device OS, and device type), search keyword and search engine, and your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, province, or metropolitan region). Such information may be considered Personal Information under certain applicable law. We collect such information using the following technologies:

* Server Logs. When you use the Services, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or another device) and your browser. To obtain such information, we may use server logs or applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.
    
* Cookies. We also use cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (or other device) by your web browser. A cookie allows the Services to recognize whether you have visited the Website before and may store user preferences and information. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer.
    
* Collaboration with Third-Party Data Collectors. We may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the information described above. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use other tracking mechanisms (such as tags or scripts) on the Services or in email communications from us, or we may allow third parties to use an application software development kit (SDK) or a server-to-server connection to collect information.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services; and thus any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
