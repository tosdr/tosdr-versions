4\. Making Payments
===================

4.1 | Payment Processor. When you make a Payment using our Services, our Payment Processor relays the credit card authorization requests and responses between you and your debit or credit card issuing bank (or one or more credit card agencies).  
  
4.2 | Service Fee. Immediately after you make a Payment using the Service, Chexy will charge you a non-refundable Service Fee. This Service Fee is payable in addition to (and in advance of) the Payment Amount. Service Fees vary based on subscription tier and payment method used.  
  
4.3 | Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the Payments you make, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. Chexy is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Payment transaction, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any Payment transaction.  
  
4.4 | Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Account, or Cash Delays and Non-Completion. Since Payment processing times depend on administrative factors and institutional backlogs beyond our control, Payments may take up to five Business Days (and in rare cases, even longer) to complete. Furthermore, completion of a Payment is contingent on both the authorization of the Payment by the applicable credit card issuing bank and acceptance of the Credit Card Payment or Debit Card Payment by the Payment Processor. In the event that a Payment is unable to be completed, we will attempt to notify you at least once through our Website or using the contact information in your Account Profile. In the case of such delay or non-completion, your liability to the intended recipient of the Payment may be subject to penalties, late fees and interest charges assessed by such recipient, all of which remain your responsibility (and not Chexy). If a Payment is not completed, you are not entitled to a return of any Service Fees charged by us, irrespective of the reason for non-completion.  
  
4.5 | No Reversals and No Refunds. If your Payment is completed, you accept and agree that no refunds, cancellations or charge backs are permitted through the Website. If a Payment is refunded, cancelled or charged back by your credit card issuing bank, bank, financial institution, or another person, you are not entitled to the return of any associated Service Fees, irrespective of the reason for such refund, cancellation or charge back. You accept and agree not to request a refund, cancellation or charge back of Service Fees from your credit card issuing bank, bank, financial institution or any other person. Your landlord may authorize a refund for a Payment by submitting a written request to us. The refund is subject to the funds being made available by your landlord and the amount will only be refunded to the payment method used for the payment. There are no refunds whatsoever twelve (12) months after the original payment transaction date.  
  
4.6 | Recurring Payments. You hereby authorize us and our respective vendors and agents to initiate debit and credit entries to any bank account you or your property manager (as applicable) authorize us to debit funds from, or any other account maintained by you, all in accordance with this Agreement. YOU HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE ADVANCE NOTICE FROM US AND OUR VENDORS AND AGENTS OF ANY AND ALL SUCH DEBITS. This authorization will remain in effect after termination of this Agreement and until all of your obligations to us have been paid in full. If you change your bank account, this authorization will apply to the new account and you shall provide us, in writing, such information regarding the new account as we deem necessary. Such new account shall thereafter be and become the new bank account for the purpose of this Agreement. It may take us up to ten (10) business days after receipt of a written notice from you to reflect in our system any change to your bank account. If you change your bank account, you agree that you are responsible for all costs incurred by us in connection with your decision to change the account. You may revoke any pre-authorization upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to us. You will receive an email notification seven days before your scheduled recurring payment is processed. It is your responsibility to disable your pre-authorized debit or recurring payment a minimum of 2 full business days before the scheduled recurring payment date. If you are set up with pre-authorized recurring credit card payments and we cannot complete the transaction with your primary credit card account on file, we will attempt to complete the transaction with the secondary credit card account on file.  
  
4.7 | Payment Limits. We may, at our sole discretion, impose limits on the Payment Amount you can send through our Services.  
  
4.8 | Insufficient Funds or Credit. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION, CHEXY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF RENT OR FEES TO YOUR LANDLORD OR PROPERTY MANAGER: YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE. ANY FAILURE IN RELATION TO MAKING A PAYMENT TO YOUR LANDLORD OR PROPERTY MANAGER IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND CHEXY IS NOT LIABLE, IN ANY WAY, FOR YOUR FAILURE OR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO YOUR LANDLORD OR PROPERTY MANAGER. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS OR CREDIT AVAILABLE TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO YOUR LANDLORD OR PROPERTY MANAGER AS A RESULT OF CHEXY CHARGING ANY APPLICABLE SERVICE FEE FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.  
  
4.9 | Declined Service Fees. If any Service Fee is declined for a Payment you have made, your account will be considered in arrears. You must pay any outstanding Service Fees to put your account back into good standing. No additional Service Fees are applicable when paying the Service Fee through your account. Failure to do so may result in your account being suspended and/ or a third party collections agency contacting you.  
  
4.10 | Default and Fraudulent Transactions. If any single transaction is investigated and is determined to be fraudulent or suspicious, in Chexy's sole discretion, Chexy may terminate or limit the relevant user's account.
