========================

### RETURNS POLICY

**\*\*\*Christmas 2024 - Extended Returns Period\*\*\*** 

We understand that gifts purchased before Christmas may need to be returned.  So to take away the worry for you and make it easier we have extended the returns period for items purchased between 1st November 2024 and 24th December 2024.

Goods purchased within this period can be returned right up to Friday, 31st January 2025. 

We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchases. If for any reason you are not satisfied with an item you have ordered, please return it, within the extended Christmas returns period and we will refund your money or send you a replacement. 

Items returned in this extended period should be returned to us in their original condition including any packaging. Please check the ‘Products we are unable to refund’ section below for exceptions.

This guarantee is in addition to your statutory rights.

### How to return items

To ensure we can deal with your return as quickly as possible please call us on 0333 400 0464 for the appropriate address to return your parcel to - we’ll also advise you on the best method of returning the goods. We ask that you wrap and parcel goods which you are returning carefully to prevent damage.   

Please fill in your Return Form (on the back of your order confirmation) or download another one below. Be sure to indicate the reason why you wish to return the goods, whether you would prefer us to send you a replacement or process a refund, and your name and order number. Please note we are only able to replace identical products (but requests for different garment sizes are acceptable).

Please obtain proof of postage (a certificate of posting is available free of charge from the Post Office). This should be kept in a safe place in case you need to claim compensation from the carrier. We regret that we cannot accept responsibility for goods in transit from our customers.

We aim to process the returned items promptly. However, during busy periods, please allow up to 21 days for your refund or replacement to be actioned. You can expect a refund in the same form of payment originally used for purchase.

Please note that the costs for returning the item to us are unrefundable, unless you are returning an item because of an error on our part or because it is damaged or defective. In these cases we will be happy to reimburse your costs in returning it to us, up to £5.

We are able to arrange collection of items at a charge of £5.00. 

Refunds for items bought as gifts can only be given to the original payer, and if you decide to swap an item, we can't stop the payer knowing.

Please note that if you applied a promotional code to your order with a minimum spend requirement and the return of your item(s) brings your order total below that threshold, your order will no longer qualify for the promotional code conditions. As a result, the refunded amount will be adjusted.

### WEEE legislation

Since 1 July 2007, the UK's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations allow members of the public to deposit old electrical and electronic items at recycling sites across the UK, free of charge.

Electrical and Electronic Equipment is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the UK, increasing by at least 5% each year. The public dispose of over 1.2 million tonnes of waste every year in the UK, and landfill sites are now reaching full capacity. Much of this waste can be recycled, and the resources recovered to make new consumer goods. The WEEE regulations aim to reduce the quantity of electrical and electronic items disposed of in this way, and will encourage everyone to play a part in protecting our environment for future generations.

To find your nearest recycling sites for waste electrical and electronic products, contact your local council, or visit [www.recycle-more.co.uk](https://www.recycle-more.co.uk/) and type your postcode into the recycling bank locator.

As retailers of electrical and electronic products, Ethical Superstore have chosen to offer a free 'take back' service to our customers.

Customers can dispose of Electricals by sending them to us (i) on a like-for-like basis when they buy a new or equivalent item, or, (ii) for all types of WEEE that have been purchased from us. At Ethical Superstore we adopt a reasonable interpretation of equivalence. For example, a customer is allowed to send back an old portable CD player when purchasing a new MP3 player as even though this is not strictly a like for-like replacement, the new product is intended to fulfil the same function.

Customers may wish to return WEEE, on a like-for-like basis, sometime after purchasing the new item e.g. if there is a need to make a change over from old to new equipment, we will accept WEEE for a reasonable period following the sale – i.e. 28 days.

We cannot accept any product including personal data for recycling. You will need to have removed any personal data from your old product prior to us receiving it as once received we will not carry out any data removal.

The products that we currently sell that will be affected are light-bulbs and electrical equipment.

![Wheelie bin symbol](//farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4853345628_6ed8827f4b_t.jpg)Under the WEEE Regulations, all new electrical goods should now be marked with the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol as shown.

Goods are marked with this symbol to show that they were produced after 13th August 2005, and should be disposed of separately from normal household waste so that they can be recycled.

To return WEEE to us, please also enclose a covering letter with details of your Order Number, Name and Address to:

Ethical Superstore  
Follingsby Avenue  
Follingbsy Park  
Gateshead
