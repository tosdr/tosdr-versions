Terms of Use
============

Last Updated: July 4, 2024.

Welcome to the Morphe LLC (“Morphe”, “us”) website,

www.morphe.com

(the “Website”). These Terms of Use and any amendments or supplements to it (this “Agreement”) tell you who we are, how you can use the Website, how you can buy our products, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. This Agreement forms a legally binding agreement between you and Morphe. This Agreement governs your access to and use the Website and the data or other content displayed on, maintained or uploaded by or onto the Website, including but not limited to the aesthetic, content, software, video, audio, pictures, trademarks, trade dress, and other information on the Website (collectively, the “Content”) and the services provided through this Website (collectively, the “Services”). Notice Regarding Dispute Resolution: 

This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and us may have against each other are resolved, including an agreement to arbitrate disputes, which will require you to submit claims you have against us to binding arbitration, and waiver of class actions and jury trial. Please read the arbitration provision (Section “Dispute Resolution”) in this agreement as it affects your rights under this Agreement.

Your use of the Services shall be deemed to constitute your consent to be bound by this Agreement and shall be enforceable in the same way as if you had signed this Agreement. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES OR WEBSITE. This Agreement applies to all users of the Services, whether you are a “visitor” or a “registered user.” By clicking “accept” during registration, or accessing any part of the Website, you agree to this Agreement. If you breach any part of this Agreement, we may revoke your license to access the Services, block your access, and suspend or cancel your account (if you have one). We may modify the terms of this Agreement at any time, in our sole discretion; provided that with respect to the terms of an order of product, the applicable terms are those accepted by you at the time of placing the order. You should check the Site and this Agreement periodically for modifications. If we do so, we’ll let you know by posting the Agreement on the Website. It’s important that you review the Agreement whenever we modify it because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted a modified Agreement on the Website, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Agreement, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

**Using the Services**

Accessing the Services. We may withdraw or amend our Website and any Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services, or the entire Services, to users, including registered users. You’re responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website and its Content.

Account Creation and Registration. To access many of the Services’ features, you must create an account. Registration is free. To register, you must complete the registration process by providing accurate information as prompted by the registration form. You also must choose a password and a username. You must not choose a username that is offensive or that infringes a person’s service mark, trademark, or trade name. You can register an account with us to help you order our products more quickly. When you create an account, you confirm that: (i) the details which you provide (e.g. your name) are real and accurate; (ii) you'll notify us immediately of any changes to your details by updating these details on your online account; (iii) you won't impersonate any other person or use any details that you're not authorized to use; (iv) if you previously had an account on the Services, we did not suspend or terminate that account for breach of this agreement; and (v) you’re creating an account for your own personal use, and you will not sell, rent, or transfer your account to any third party.

Responsibility for Account. You’re responsible for keeping your password and account confidential. Further, you’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other security breach. You must not sell, rent, lease, share, or provide access to your account to anyone else, including charging anyone for access to administrative rights on your account. We may disable any username, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any reason or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have breached any part of this agreement. If you register an account with us, please keep in mind that we will treat anyone who uses your username and password as "you." We will provide this user with all of the rights and privileges that we provide to you, and we will hold you responsible for the activities of a person using your password.

Liability for Account Misuse. We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur because of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. You could be held liable for losses incurred by us or another person because of someone else using your password or account.

Use of Other Accounts. You must not use anyone else’s account at any time.

Account Security. We care about the integrity and security of your personal information. But we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will never be able to defeat the Website’s security measures or use any personal information you provide to us for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

Communication and Preferences. By registering for an account, you consent to receive electronic communications from us relating to your account. These communications may involve sending emails to the email address you provided during registration or posting communications on the Website and will include notices about your account (e.g., change in password, confirmation emails, and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. You acknowledge that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. We recommend that you keep copies of electronic communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You also consent to receive certain other communications from us, including newsletters about new features and content, special offers, promotional announcements, and customer surveys via email or other methods. We do not provide facilities for sending or receiving confidential electronic communications. You should consider all messages sent to us or from us as open communications readily accessible to the public. You should not use the Website to send or receive messages you only intend the sender and named recipients to read. Users or operators of the Website may read all messages you send to or through the Website regardless of whether they are the intended recipients.

**Copyright Complaints**

Morphe respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify Morphe of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

Morphe will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement.

You should note that if you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.

**Limitations of Liability**

Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information on the Website, we can't guarantee that the content on the Website is accurate, complete or up to date. If you have a question about any information on the Website, let us know by calling or emailing us.

We do not undertake to review material before it is posted on the Website and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party.

We are not liable for anything that you post or say while you are on the Website. We don’t monitor the content posted to the Website, but if we do see, or someone tells us that you’ve posted, something that we consider inappropriate or offensive, we will remove it and may take appropriate action against you. If you post content that belongs to someone else and they get annoyed (or even call in their lawyers), we’re not in the firing line. You have to take responsibility for what you post.

You hereby release Morphe, its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers from all liability arising out of your User Content or the conduct of other users or third parties, including disputes between you and one or more other users or third parties.

NEITHER MORPHE NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT MORPHE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL MORPHE’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO MORPHE. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN MORPHE AND YOU.

Waiver of California Civil Code Section 1542—California Residents Only. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, in or outside of the United States, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

Scope of Disclaimers, Exclusions, and Limitations. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations stated in this Agreement apply to the greatest extent allowed by law, but no more. We do not intend to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you by law. Because some jurisdictions may prohibit the disclaimer of some warranties, the exclusion of some damages, or other matters, one or more of the disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations will not apply to you.

**Termination**

We may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation, all provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution provisions. You agree that any such suspension or termination may be effected without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such action.

**Governing Law; Jurisdiction**

This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Services or this agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California or any state court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, CA. Each party submits to the personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the state courts of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, CA to resolve all disputes not subject to arbitration. Each party waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.

**Dispute Resolution**

Arbitration. Please read this “Dispute Resolution” section carefully. It is an integral part of this Agreement and affects your rights with respect to dispute resolution and the remedies you may have. It also contains a class action waiver.

For any dispute you may have with Morphe, you agree to first contact us at help@morphe.com and to work with us in good faith to resolve the dispute informally. In the event we are not able to resolve your dispute within sixty (60) calendar days after you brought it to our attention, you and Morphe mutually agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims that qualify for small claims court and claims for equitable relief, as provided below) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or your access or use of Morphe, the Website, and/or Services (collectively, “Claims”) by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. Information about JAMS, including contact information, can be found at www.jamsadr.com.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any Claims relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Arbitration Section in this Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Section is void or voidable. The judgment of the arbitrator and the award of the arbitrator is final and binding on you and Morphe.

The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, CA, unless you and Morphe agree otherwise. JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and obtain a fee waiver from JAMS. The award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.

Nothing in this Arbitration Section will be deemed as preventing you or Morphe from seeking equitable relief from the courts as necessary and applicable, nor for adjudicating a Claim in small claims court if that Claim qualifies so long as the Claim remains in such court and advanced only on an individual basis, not a class or representative basis.

Jury Trial Waiver. Each party waives its right to a jury trial in proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.

Class Action Waiver. All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both parties acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in a class action.

Limitation on Time to Bring Claims. A party will not file a claim arising out of or relating to the Services or this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Any claim brought after one year is barred.

SMS

Wunderkind. Morphe uses a third party performance marketing technology company called Wunderkind Corporation. ("Wunderkind") to send marketing and promotional SMS text messages to its customers. These may include cart reminder messages.

Receiving Text Messages. You can choose to receive promotional text messages from Morphe by signing up on our Website or by sending a text message indicating your consent to 689-08. If you consent to receiving recurring marketing or promotional SMS text messages from us (each, a “Text Message”), these will be sent by Wunderkind through an automatic telephone dialing system. This service is optional and is not a condition for purchase. Where you consent to receiving Text Messages from Morphe, you are also consenting to Morphe sharing the information that we collect from you with Wunderkind (please see the Section below entitled “Information we will collect from you”),

Opting out of Text Messages. You can opt out of receiving any further Text Messages from us at any time by replying “STOP” to any Text Message you receive from us. For help, reply “HELP” to any Text Message you receive from us or email info@morphe.com or textsupport@wunderkind.co.

Charges. Your service carrier's standard message and data rates may apply to our Text Messages and any SMS text messages you send to us or Wunderkind. Please check your service carrier's pricing plan to work out the charges for browsing data and sending and receiving Text Messages. Under no circumstances will Wunderkind, Morphe or our affiliates be responsible for any SMS messaging, data or wireless charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your device or telephone number. If your service carrier does not permit SMS messages, you may not receive Text Messages.

Our liability. We are not responsible for any delays in the receipt of, or failure to deliver, any Text Messages. Delivery of Text Messages depends on effective transmission from your network operator. We do not promise that your receipt of Text Messages will be error free. Our Text Message services are on an "as is" and "as available” basis. We may stop sending Text Messages to you at any time at our sole discretion.

Information we will collect from you. If you sign up to receive Text Messages, we may collect the following information from you:

    your phone number;

    your service carrier’s name; and

    date, time and content of your text messages.

We may use this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy to contact you and to provide the services you request from us. This information will also be given to Wunderkind to enable them to send you Text Messages and provide services to you. For more information on how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy.

Updating your phone number. If you change or deactivate your phone number, you must update your account information and the phone number(s) attached to your account to prevent us from accidentally communicating with anyone who takes over your old phone number(s).

Disputes. If you're not happy with any of these terms of this SMS Marketing Policy or your receipt of Text Messages, you and Morphe agree that any disagreement or dispute will be resolved through mandatory final and binding arbitration. Arbitration is often less formal than a lawsuit. Instead of a judge deciding a case, a neutral arbitrator is appointed. The arbitration will be governed by the laws of the State of California.

No class actions. By agreeing to the terms of this SMS Marketing Policy, you agree only to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not to bring any claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.

This Agreement must be read in conjunction (i) with other agreements into which you and Morphe enter concerning the Website (if any), and (ii) with our Privacy Policy.

General Terms

This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Morphe and you regarding the Services, and this Agreement supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Morphe and you regarding the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without Morphe’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this Agreement, without such consent, will be null. Morphe may freely assign or transfer this Agreement without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. Any notices or other communications provided by Morphe under this Agreement, including those regarding modifications to this Agreement, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Website. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. You consent to receive any notice from us in electronic form either (1) by email to the last known email address we have for you or (2) by posting the notice on a place on the Website chosen for this purpose.  Morphe’s failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Morphe. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise.
