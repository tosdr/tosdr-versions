Web Privacy Policy
==================

[Home](https://www.midlandcredit.com/) Web Privacy Policy

Last Updated July 7, 2023

Effective Date: October 19, 2022

The Web Privacy Policy outlined below is applicable to information you submit to our web site at [www.midlandcredit.com](https://www.midlandcredit.com/) or [https://mcmpay.com/](https://mcmpay.com/) (collectively, the “Site”). It does not apply to information collected from other sources, including off-line information collection. For general information related to our collection and use of personally identifiable information from any source, including the Site, please see our [Privacy Notice](https://www.midlandcredit.com/privacy-policy-and-state-disclosures/).

We may change this Web Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective Date” legend at the top of the page indicates when this Web Privacy Policy was last revised.

**Information We Collect**

MCM respects your right to privacy, and your right to be free from unwanted Internet intrusions. When a visitor contacts the Site, we may collect personal identifying information such as name, street and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, the site the visitor linked from, and other information which, when used by itself or with other data, might identify that person (“Personally Identifiable Information”). We typically collect Information from these sources:

**Automatic Information.** We receive and store some Information automatically when you interact with the Site, such as information your web browser provides to our web server. Like many websites, we use “cookies,” which are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable us to recognize your device and to provide certain features to you. For example, we may use Marketing Munchkin Tracking cookies to track behavior of certain consumers who visit our website and may use Marketo cookies from our third-party email provider to track whether our emails are opened and to track certain activity on the Site. More information on Marketo’s privacy and cookie policy can be found at [https://www.marketo.com/company/legal/](https://www.marketo.com/company/legal/).

If you prefer that we do not place cookies on your web browser you may opt out by clicking the Do Not Track (DNT) feature in your browser. This prevents tracking for your particular browser and device. The Help feature on most browsers will also tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Because cookies enable you to use certain features on the Site, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

**Third Party Analytics Providers .** We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit, when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site on your browser.

We also use FullStory’s session recording services to better understand how MCM’s visitors use the Site and to optimize the functionality of our site for the best user experience. We record and/or monitor your use of the Site, such as pages visited, links clicked, text entered, and mouse movements, as well as information more commonly collected such as the referring URL, browser, operating system, cookie information, and Internet Service Provider. We also collect potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (or “IP”) addresses. Also, you may choose to interact with the Site in a manner that results in your providing, and our recording the entry of, other personally-identifiable information such as your name, email address, password, financial account details, and other sensitive information. MCM does not use information recorded via its usage of FullStory to identify its visitors and does not use such information other than under the circumstances described in this Web Privacy Policy or MCM’s Privacy Notice. By using the Site, you are aware and consent to our recording of your information and activity on our Site for the purposes described herein. If you prefer that we do not record your web sessions, you may opt out here: [https://www.fullstory.com/optout/#](https://www.fullstory.com/optout/)

**Ad Partners.** We use search and display networks, such as Google Ads and Microsoft’s Bing to reach consumers. These platforms allow us to communicate with consumers using tools such as standard and custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, and demographic and location targeting. They also allow us to monitor the performance of our ads through conversion tracking. None of the information utilized or collected in these practices is Personally Identifiable Information. We also use the remarketing features in platforms such as GoogleAds to reach specific audiences. Google and others utilize cookies to display customized ads to customers who have previously visited this website . If you prefer, you may opt out of Google’s use of cookies for advertising, including DoubleClick cookies, at any time by visiting Google’s Ad Settings page at [https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en](https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated?hl=en).

We also use display networks such as DV360 and Criteo to reach our consumers. When you visit the Site, we may utilize cookies that help us better understand your browsing behavior using our Site. None of the information utilized or collected in these practices is Personally Identifiable Information. If you prefer not to receive these ads, you may opt out at any time by visiting [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) or visit [https://www.criteo.com/privacy/disable-criteo-services-on-internet-browsers/](https://www.criteo.com/privacy/disable-criteo-services-on-internet-browsers/).

We may also use social media sites such as Facebook to retarget ads to MCM consumers. You can opt out of the type of ads you see on Facebook by visiting [https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217/](https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217/).

**E-mail Messages.** We receive and store information you provide to us through electronic mail (“e-mail”) communications to us. Additionally, to help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from the Site if your computer supports such capabilities. We also use third-party marketing software from Marketo to send our emails.

**Mobile.** When you download or use apps created by or for MCM or the Site, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as marketing, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.

**Information you provide to us.** We receive and store information you enter on the Site, for example, when you complete a search request, or voluntarily provide information in any other way on the Site.

**Your Choices About Your Personally Identifiable Information**

* **Managing “Do Not Track” Signals.** Some browsers have a Do Not Track (“DNT”) feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want your online activities tracked.

MCM’s Site does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms.
* **Protections for Children.** The Site is not designed for or targeted to children under the age of 18. MCM will never knowingly solicit or collect Personally Identifiable Information from a child under the age of 18 through the Site. If we discover that a child under the age of 18 has submitted Personally Identifiable Information, we will delete that information.
* **Commercial Electronic Communications.** If you do not wish to receive electronic communications from us, you may opt-out of receiving future electronic communications by clicking the unsubscribe link featured in our emails, contacting us at the phone number at the bottom of the page, or changing your setting in your online account at mcmpay.com.

You may control the Push Messages in your device’s settings. Some of the Push Messages may be related to your location or to your use of the Site or its content. Your carrier may charge standard messaging, data and other fees for use of Push Messages, and these fees may appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance. Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Push Messages and certain Push Messages may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues. You may discontinue Push Messages in your device’s settings. We may collect information related to your use of Push Messages.
