    Chief Compliance Officer:  
    P.O. Box 939069  
    San Diego, CA 92193**
* **11\. PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS:** These Payment Terms and Conditions (the “Payment Terms and Conditions”) are part of this TOU and govern any payment transaction you initiate on the MCM Website (each, a “Payment Transaction”). If you choose to use the MCM Website to make a Payment Transaction, you accept and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions.
    * **11.1  Scope:** As used herein, the words “bank account” refer to the account held by a bank, securities firm, or other financial institution from which payment will be made when you make a Payment Transaction. The words “your bank” mean the bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that holds your account and/or issued your credit or debit card. Making a Payment Transaction will enable you to pay your account(s) online. MCM, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service, and specific payment methods, to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time.
    * **11.2  Payment Authorization (Including Automatic Payments):** To make a Payment Transaction, including automatic payments (if eligible), you must designate a valid major credit card, check, or electronic check (“Payment Method”). Each time you initiate a Payment Transaction, you authorize us or our agent to draw a check or draft, initiate an automated clearing house (“ACH”) debit, and/or charge your Payment Method, in your name to the bank account you specify, payable to us or to our agent, in the amount of the Payment Transaction, on the date(s) specified (“Billing Date”) of the month(s) of payment according to the schedule (one-time or recurring) that you have affirmatively elected to enroll in for your account. Your transaction must be payable in U.S. dollars. By paying using your designated Payment Method, you agree that: (a) you have read, understand and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions, and that this agreement constitutes a “writing signed by you” under any applicable law or regulation; (b) you consent to the electronic delivery of the disclosures contained in these Terms and Conditions; (c) you authorize MCM (or its agent) to make any inquiries or take any other action we consider necessary to validate your bank account or any dispute involving your payment, which may include engaging with third-party account validation providers to validate your bank account, ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or verifying the information you provide against third party databases; (d) you authorize MCM (or its agent) to initiate one or more drafts or ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s) from your bank account; and (e) you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such payments, debit your debit card, and/or charge your credit card, and to initiate any debit or credit entries to your bank account in the amount of such payments or corrections.
    * **11.3  Charges:** Before you make your payment, make sure you have enough money in your bank account to cover the payment. For each transaction, your bank may assess its customary per-check or item-handling charge, if any. Your bank may also assess its customary charge for each dishonored check or draft. If any transaction (check, demand, draft, debit, or charge debited or drawn by us or our agent in connection with your Payment Transaction) is not honored by your bank, we have the right to collect the amount from you as permitted by applicable law. If this happens, we may cancel your right to make Payment Transactions on the MCM Website.  
        For certain accounts, you may have a separate agreement with a participating bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that allows a line of credit to be accessed in the event that your account contains insufficient funds to make payment to us. You should refer to the appropriate agreement relating to that line of credit for the terms and conditions that govern its use.
    * **11.4  Payment:** Any request or order to settle or make a Payment Transaction shall require MCM’s confirmation of acceptance, and may also require additional verification or information from a third-party account verification provider and additional verification or information from you before acceptance by MCM. All amounts are denoted in US Dollars ($). MCM utilizes third party payment processors, and you hereby agree that MCM may charge your chosen payment method for any Payment Transaction and for any applicable taxes. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you in connection with any credit card, debit card, or other payment method utilized in connection with a Payment Transaction with MCM. MCM does not assess fees or interest to a consumer’s balance throughout the period of active repayment (except those awarded by a court upon agreement with the consumer or after due process of law); however, missed payments will invalidate any agreed upon arrangement. Interest on the account, if applicable, which had been deferred while payments were being received may be added back to the account after payments ceased. MCM also reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the MCM Website if you fail to pay any amounts when due. You shall reimburse MCM for all reasonable costs incurred (including reasonable attorney’s fees) in collecting past-due amounts.
    * **11.5  Third-Party Processors:** You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any third party payment processor’s terms and conditions and may be required to establish an account with a third party payment service provider in order to complete a Payment Transaction. You may also be required to abide by additional instructions from and to agree to further terms and conditions with MCM regarding payment, retrieving data, and receiving other services. If there is a conflict between this TOU and such other or third party terms and conditions, this TOU shall control as it relates to the subject matter of this TOU.
    * **11.6  Current Information:** It is your responsibility to make sure that your Payment Method information and contact information are current at all times during the term of the payment plan you specify in your Payment Transaction.
    * **11.7  Payment Processing for Online Payments:** With limited exceptions, we will endeavor for Payment Transactions to be processed within 24 hours of receipt. Payment Transactions made at or before 2:00 pm PST may be credited to your account the same day. Payment Transactions made after 2:00 pm PST may be credited to your account the following business day. You are solely responsible for making payments sufficiently available prior to the due date, and you are solely responsible for actions taken on your account resulting from a late payment.
    * **11.8  Turning Off Automatic Payment or Voiding Your Plan:** To cancel automatic payments on your payment plan, please contact us directly at the phone number at the bottom of the page. You may also void your plan by logging into your account located on the MCM Website, or by calling the same number. Such cancellation or termination shall be effective at the time of cancellation or termination. To cancel, change, or modify your payments or plan, please call or log-on at least two (2) Business Days before the Billing Date, unless otherwise permitted under applicable law, or your payment may be debited and/or charged for the then due payment. If you have entered into an agreement on a pending civil action regarding the underlying debt or a court has approved your payment plan and it, or the agreement itself, requires additional actions by either party in the event of your non-payment or default, then your cancellation of online automatic payments will be honored. However, this may not affect your legal rights or your obligations to pay as agreed. “Business Day” means Monday through Friday, excluding official U.S. government holidays and official MCM corporate holidays.  
        **TO VOID YOUR PLAN:**  
        **Online:** Click on “View Payment Plan”  
        Click on “Void Plan”  
        **By Phone:** Call us at [1-800-296-2657](tel:18002962657).
    * **11.9  Customer Service:** Payment Transactions that we process using your Payment Method, will be identified as “Midland Credit Management, Inc.” (or similar identifier) on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution holding your account. All questions relating to any transactions made using your bank account by us should be initially directed to us. Save the payment confirmation that you are provided when you make a payment, and check it against your applicable account statement. You may contact us regarding any payments made using your bank account or other method by writing to us at 350 Camino De La Reina, Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92108, or by phone at 1-877-420-0039. You may also view your transaction history for your payment at any time in the Account Details screen.
    * **11.10  Transaction Errors and Advisability of Prompt Reporting:** If you believe that any Payment Transaction initiated by MCM (or its agent) with respect to your bank account is erroneous, or if you need more information about any such transaction, you should contact us as soon as possible. Notify us at once if you believe the password associated with your account has been lost or stolen, or if someone has attempted (or may attempt) to make a transfer from your bank account to complete a payment using your account without your permission. We reserve the right to cancel the ability to pay using the MCM Website for any reason at any time. You also should contact your bank for the Payment Method.
    * **11.11  Our Liability for Improper Transactions or Payments:** Federal law limits your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous unauthorized transaction from your bank account based on how quickly you report it to your financial institution. As general rule, you should report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions to your bank within 60 days after the questionable transaction FIRST appeared on your bank account statement. You should contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply to your account and any unauthorized transactions, including any limits on your liability. We will not be liable to you in the following instances:
        * – If, through no fault of ours, your account does not contain enough money to complete the transaction;
        * – If the funds in your account are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting the transaction; or
        * – If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken
    * **11.12  Disclosure of Payment Information to Third-Parties:** To protect your privacy, we will not disclose any information about your online payment transactions to any person, except as follows:
        * 1. as necessary to complete transactions, including without limitation to validate any bank account with a third party account verification provider such as Bank of America’s U.S. Account Validation service using the National Shared Database, to verify the bank account prior to completion of certain web-based transactions;
        * 2. to validate or verify the existence and condition any dispute involving payment, including with a third party, such as a financial institution or credit bureau (or, for Massachusetts residents, a consumer reporting agency as defined in chapter 93 of the Massachusetts General Laws);
        * 3. to comply with government agency or court orders;
        * 4. to our employees, auditors, service providers, attorneys, or collection agents in the course of their duties;
        * 5. to persons authorized by law in the course of their official duties; or
        * 6. if you give us your written permission.
    * **11.13  Termination:** MCM, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time. You may terminate your participation in this service, but you must do so by writing to us at the address disclosed in the Section of these Payment Terms and Conditions entitled “Customer Service.” For automatic payments, see the section of these Payment Terms and Conditions entitled “Cancellation of Automatic Payments.” If you close your account, you agree to notify us first and to stop initiating transactions, and pay all agreed upon payments
    * **11.14  Prior Agreements and Assignments:** These Payment Terms and Conditions terminate and take the place of all prior agreements you may have with us relating to any Payment Transactions. We have the right to assign these Payment Terms and Conditions to a subsidiary or affiliate company at any time.
    * **11.15  Note for Massachusetts Residents:**  
        GENERAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT: Any documentation provided to you which indicates that an electronic fund transfer was made shall be admissible as evidence of such transfer and shall constitute prima facie proof that such transfer was made.  
        The initiation by you of certain electronic funds transfers from your account will, except as otherwise provided in these Payment Terms and Conditions, effectively eliminate your ability to stop payment of the transfer.  
        UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT STOP PAYMENT OF ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS; THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD NOT EMPLOY ELECTRONIC ACCESS FOR PAYMENTS UNLESS YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT YOU WILL NOT NEED TO STOP PAYMENT.  
        DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNT INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES: If you give us your written authorization to disclose information about you, your account or the transactions that you make to any person, that authorization shall be effective until we receive written notification from you to cancel such authorization, unless otherwise agreed or permitted by law, or as necessary under Paragraph 11.12.
    * **11.16  Changes to Payment Terms and Conditions:** We may in our discretion change these Payment Terms and Conditions, TOU, Web Privacy Policy, and/or our Privacy Notice at any time without notice to you. If any change is found to be invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any other changes or the remainder of these Payment Terms and Conditions or these TOU. We reserve the right to subcontract any of our rights or obligations under these Payment Terms and Conditions and TOU.  
        YOUR CONTINUED USE OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AS A PAYMENT METHOD ON THE MCM WEBSITE AFTER WE CHANGE THESE PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, TOU, WEB PRIVACY POLICY AND/OR OUR PRIVACY NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE CHANGES.
    * **11.17 Consent to Electronic Communication:** You should print and retain a copy of all disclosures and communications. You agree to accept all disclosures and other communications between you and MCM on this Website or at the primary e-mail address associated with your account. By indicating your acceptance to these Payment Terms and Conditions in any way, including by clicking a button, checking a box, or continuing to use the Website, you also are consenting to receive a one-time confirmation of your enrollment in this service electronically to the e-mail address you have provided to us. We reserve the right to send the confirmation via paper under certain conditions. MCM reserves the right to stop delivery of the electronic confirmation in its sole discretion. In order to receive the electronic confirmation of your enrollment in this service you must have access to a personal computer with a 128-bit javascript-enabled browser, internet access and a valid electronic mail account supported by software that enables you to receive electronic communications. In order to store electronic communications from us, you will need a printer connected to your computer to enable you to print such communications for storage in your off-line files, or a hard drive or a disk drive to download the electronic confirmation communication for storage on your computer. MCM will not provide paper copies of the electronic confirmation letter.

But, by transmitting any [feedback or suggestions](https://www.midlandcredit.com/contact/) and any related information, material, or other content (collectively, “feedback”) to MCM, you represent and warrant that such feedback does not infringe or violate the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any third party (including, without limitation, patents, copyrights, or trademark rights) and that you have all rights necessary to convey such feedback to MCM. In addition, any feedback received by MCM will be deemed to include from you a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, non-exclusive right and license for MCM to adopt, publish, reproduce, disseminate, transmit, distribute, copy, use, create derivative works of, display (in whole or in part) worldwide, or act on such feedback without additional approval or consideration, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in the information, material, or content related to such feedback, and you hereby waive any claim to the contrary.

    MOREOVER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL MCM BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR LOST PROFITS, FOR LOST DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF MCM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, TOTAL LIABILITY OF MCM FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE, RESULTS FROM USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE, OR FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS TOU SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00 USD).
* **15\. ARBITRATION:**  
    **ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE, OR TO ANY INTERACTION WITH MCM OR ITS PARENT OR AFFILIATES, WHETHER THROUGH THE MCM WEBSITE OR OTHERWISE, OR TO ANY PRODUCT(S) OR SERVICE(S) OFFERED BY MCM OR ITS PARENT OR AFFILIATES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT,** EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.

Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that MCM or its licensors post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to MCM to enforce any provision of this TOU.
* **17\. TERMINATION:** MCM also reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraud, illegal activity, or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this TOU, to terminate this TOU with you (including any registered account) and your right to access and use the MCM Website. You acknowledge and agree that MCM shall have the sole right to determine in its reasonable discretion whether you are engaging in any unauthorized activity and/or violating any term or conditions of this TOU.

GOVERNING LAW:** This TOU has been made in and will be construed and enforced solely in accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the State of California.

You may not assign or otherwise transfer this TOU or the license granted hereunder or delegate any of your duties specified herein, in whole or in part, without MCM’s prior written consent. Any attempt of assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of this TOU shall be void, of no effect, and a material breach of this TOU. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MCM may assign this TOU in whole or in part. Moreover, MCM may delegate its rights and responsibilities or use contractors or agents to fulfill its obligations under this TOU. Failure by MCM to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU will not operate as a waiver of that or any subsequent default or failure of performance. In the event any provision of this TOU is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of this TOU, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of this TOU nor the remaining provisions herein, and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision. Headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This TOU and MCM’s Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein, represent the entire agreement between you and MCM with respect to subject matter herein, and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between you and MCM with respect to the MCM Website.
