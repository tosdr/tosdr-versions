This Section applies to a School's use of the Service.

When the Vocabulary.com Service is used by a School for an educational purpose, Vocabulary.com may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by a student. "Student Data" is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable student and may include "educational records" as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA").

The School or the student, and not Vocabulary.com, owns and controls the Student Data. You authorize Vocabulary.com to access, collect, transmit, modify, display and store Student Data to provide the Service and as described in this Agreement and in our Privacy Policy.

Compliance with Laws. In the U.S., Vocabulary.com may collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g). Individually and collectively, we and our School Users agree to uphold our obligations under FERPA, COPPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment ("PPRA"), applicable State laws relating to student data privacy, and with all other laws and regulations governing the protection of Student Data.

Use of Student Data. By submitting, providing us access to, or causing us to receive Student Data, you agree that Vocabulary.com may use the Student Data for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School's or the User's consent.

Use of De-Identified or Anonymized Student Data. You agree that both before and after the term of the Agreement, Vocabulary.com may collect, analyze, use, and retain data derived from Student Data as well as data about users' access and use of the Service, for the purpose of operating, analyzing, improving or marketing the Service, developing new products or services, conducting research or other purposes, provided that Vocabulary.com may not share or publicly disclose information that is derived from Student Data unless such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.

Use of Personal Information for Marketing. You agree that Vocabulary.com may provide customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to school, teacher or district administrative users and other non-student users from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data. For emphasis, and without limitation, Vocabulary.com shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.

Disclosure of Student Data and Third-Party Service Providers. You acknowledge and agree that Vocabulary.com may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers which have a legitimate need to access such information to provide their services to us. We and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data. Vocabulary.com shall not share Student Data with third parties other than as described in this Agreement and in the Vocabulary.com Privacy Policy, or with consent of the School or parent.

Student Data Access and Deletion Requests. You may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing, and we shall comply with such request within thirty (30) days, except that Vocabulary.com shall not be required to delete Student Data that has been moved to a personal family account on the Service or as otherwise prohibited by law. A parent or student over the age of 18 seeking to access, modify, correct, or delete personal information in a student account that is connected to a School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification.

Vocabulary.com is not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data if such data is de-identified and/or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably identify a specific individual.

Data Security and Breach Notification. We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure the personal information in Vocabulary.com's possession and control from unauthorized access, disclosure and use. If an unauthorized party gains access to or has been disclosed Student Data (a "Security Event"), that we have collected or received through the Service under this Agreement, we will promptly notify the School. If, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of Vocabulary.com or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws and Vocabulary.com shall indemnify the School for reasonable costs related to legally-required notifications. With respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of Vocabulary.com or its agents, Vocabulary.com shall reasonably cooperate with School's investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at School's reasonable expense, but Vocabulary.com shall not indemnify a School for costs associated with the Security Event. Vocabulary.com shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to users that are not associated with a School account.

This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). This Agreement is a contract for the provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any substantially similar legislation as may be enacted, shall not apply to this Agreement. If you are located outside of the territory of the United States, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not govern this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Mateo County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Mateo County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

19\. ARBITRATION

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Vocabulary.com. For any dispute with Vocabulary.com, you agree to first contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.vocabulary.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Vocabulary.com has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in San Mateo County, California, unless you and Vocabulary.com agree otherwise. If you are a School or are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Vocabulary.com from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.

20\. CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER

WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Vocabulary.com ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
