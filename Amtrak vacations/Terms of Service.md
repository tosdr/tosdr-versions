**CANCELLATION WAIVER PROGRAM LIMITS**  
Pre-Departure Vacation Protection Waiver………………..Trip Cost

**Pre-Departure Vacation Protection Waiver**

Amtrak Vacations’ Vacation Protection Waiver allows you to cancel your Amtrak Vacations arrangements for any reason up to 12:00 noon Eastern Time on last business day prior to the first services offered by Amtrak Vacations.

Important: Amtrak Vacations’ Vacation Protection Waiver must be purchased at time of booking or when deposit is paid and is non-refundable and non-transferable. The Amtrak Vacations’ Vacation Protection Waiver is a prepaid plan and is non-refundable if Amtrak cancels scheduled service. The Amtrak Vacations’ Vacation Protection Waiver does not cover cancellation or “no shows” on the day of departure. A “No Show” is defined as a failure to notify Amtrak Vacations of a cancellation prior to 12:00 noon Eastern Time on last business day prior to the first services offered by Amtrak Vacations.

Note: If the number of individuals occupying a room decreases or if the number of travellers sharing the cost of a component on their trip changes, the remaining travellers will be responsible for additional costs incurred as a result of a change in the person occupancy rate. In this case, Amtrak Vacations reserves the right to deduct the extra costs from the refund to the person who cancels. If insufficient funds are deducted from the cancelling client, the traveling clients will be charged the remaining portion of the additional costs.

Cancellations must be made before noon Eastern Time on the last business day prior to the first services offered by Amtrak Vacations. The Trip Protection Option will receive a future travel credit for the full value of the reservation excluding the price of the Trip Protection. Customers will have the flexibility to apply their credit to travel on any one of our 3 brands: Amtrak Vacations, Yankee Holidays, and Railbookers. This banked credit is transferable and is valid for 2 years.
