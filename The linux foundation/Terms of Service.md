###### Policies

Terms
=====

If you use the¬†[LFX](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/)¬†platform and services, please note that such use is subject to the¬†[LFX Platform Use Agreement](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/platform-use-agreement)¬†and the other documents referenced therein, rather than the Terms of Use set forth below.

* * *

By using Linux Foundation websites you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.

Here‚Äôs the basic idea:

* Don‚Äôt violate anyone‚Äôs intellectual property and/or post anyone else‚Äôs copyrighted or confidential material you don‚Äôt have permission to use.
* Don‚Äôt post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc.
* Don‚Äôt post spam.
* Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted. If you try to boost your SEO, that‚Äôs an abuse of the system.
* Don‚Äôt post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but don‚Äôt mention how to buy it every single time.
* Don‚Äôt launch into personal attacks. You‚Äôre not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
* Tone down the foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.

The Linux Foundation and its websites provide a framework for discussion and user generated information to expand the knowledge base of Linux-related information. Please note that articles, as well as any other user content on Linuxfoundation.org (such as blogs, directory content, forums, comments, etc.), do not reflect the views or endorsements of the Linux Foundation, its staff, or its members. We recognize that there may be inaccurate information reflected in this site and that users should understand that something that appears on Linuxfoundation.org does not mean the Linux Foundation has vetted or endorsed that content.

Linux Foundation reserves the right to take down anything you post on this site, for these or other reasons. If you don‚Äôt agree to these terms, don‚Äôt use this website. Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from the site‚Äôs administrators. A second violation will result in the removal of your user account.
