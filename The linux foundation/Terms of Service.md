###### Policies

Terms
=====

If you use the [LFX](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/) platform and services, please note that such use is subject to the [LFX Platform Use Agreement](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/platform-use-agreement) and the other documents referenced therein, rather than the Terms of Use set forth below.

* * *

By using Linux Foundation websites you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions here.

Here’s the basic idea:

* Don’t violate anyone’s intellectual property and/or post anyone else’s copyrighted or confidential material you don’t have permission to use.
* Don’t post anything vulgar, inflammatory, pornographic, etc.
* Don’t post spam.
* Too many metalinks and tags are not accepted. If you try to boost your SEO, that’s an abuse of the system.
* Don’t post just to sell something. Sure, talk up your project, but don’t mention how to buy it every single time.
* Don’t launch into personal attacks. You’re not going to agree with everyone, but name-calling will just cause trouble and will be regarded as flaming behavior.
* Tone down the foul language. You can say what you need to say without relying on cursing. In fact, your writing will be regarded as that much more creative.

The Linux Foundation and its websites provide a framework for discussion and user generated information to expand the knowledge base of Linux-related information. Please note that articles, as well as any other user content on Linuxfoundation.org (such as blogs, directory content, forums, comments, etc.), do not reflect the views or endorsements of the Linux Foundation, its staff, or its members. We recognize that there may be inaccurate information reflected in this site and that users should understand that something that appears on Linuxfoundation.org does not mean the Linux Foundation has vetted or endorsed that content.

Linux Foundation reserves the right to take down anything you post on this site, for these or other reasons. If you don’t agree to these terms, don’t use this website. Violation of the terms in this document may result in the removal of the content and a warning from the site’s administrators. A second violation will result in the removal of your user account.

In all such cases, and to the extent there is a conflict, those license terms or agreements take precedence over these Terms of Use. With respect to any User Content not governed by other Workgroup or project specific terms or agreements, you agree that the following non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free worldwide licenses shall apply:

Code Submissions. User Content in the form of source or object code will be governed by the [BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).

You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this Web site any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, or profane material, or any other material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under the law.

### Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

The Linux Foundation and the Members make no representations whatsoever about any other Web site that you may access through this Web site. When you access a non-Linux Foundation Web site, even one that may contain the organization’s name or mark, please understand that it is independent from The Linux Foundation, and that the Linux Foundation and the Members have no control over the content on such Web site. In addition, a link to a non-Linux Foundation Web site does not mean that the Linux Foundation or the Members endorse or accept any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such Web site.

It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE LINUX FOUNDATION AND/OR THE MEMBERS BE LIABLE TO YOU (AN INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY) OR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATED TO ANY USE OF THIS WEB SITE, THE CONTENT, OR ON ANY OTHER HYPER LINKED WEB SITE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR OTHER DATA ON YOUR INFORMATION HANDLING SYSTEM OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE LINUX FOUNDATION OR THE MEMBERS ARE EXPRESSLY ADVISED OR AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.

ALL CONTENT IS PROVIDED BY THE LINUX FOUNDATION AND/OR THE MEMBERS ON AN “AS IS” BASIS ONLY. THE LINUX FOUNDATION AND THE MEMBERS PROVIDE NO REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS AND/OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The Linux Foundation and the Members reserve the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of these Terms of Use and to take any action they deem appropriate including, without limitation, reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to user profiles, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses and traffic information.

The Linux Foundation and the Members reserve the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms of Use, including but not limited to the right to block access from a particular Internet address or account holder to this Web site.
