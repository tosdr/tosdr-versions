General Data Processing

**Scope of processing of personal data**

We process personal data that we receive in the course of your visit to our Website, if you contact us or use our services.  
  
**Legal basis for the processing of personal data**

When processing personal data, we rely on the following legal bases:  
 

* the performance of a contract to which the affected person (the "**data subject**") is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (this also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures)
* legitimate interests of our company or a third party, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former mentioned interests
* fulfillment of legal obligations to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR
* consent, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR

The purposes for which we process personal data, relevant legal bases and specific legitimate interests (where legitimate interests are the basis for processing) are stated further below.

  
**Data processing by processors**  
 

* In some cases, we use external service providers to process personal data (e.g., service providers for customer management, service providers for invoice management, IT service providers). These have been carefully selected by us and commissioned in accordance with data protection requirements, are bound by our instructions and are regularly monitored.  
      
     

**Transfer of personal data to other external recipients (third parties)**

Various external recipients, which are not engaged as processors as outlined in the section above "Data processing by processors", may receive your personal data. Such external recipients are also called third parties. A data transfer to these external recipients may take place for the performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR), if a corresponding consent has been given (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b , Art. 7 GDPR), based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) or if it is required by law (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR).

  
Recipients within the company group

NEMETSCHEK SE - Konrad-Zuse-Platz 1 - 81829 Munich - Germany

Maxon Computer Inc. - 515 Marin St., Ste 322, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 - USA

Maxon Computer Ltd. - 114 High Street, Cranfield - Bedfordshire, MK43 0DG - United Kingdom

Maxon Computer Canada Inc. - 434, rue St.-Pierre, bureau 400, Montréal, Québec, H2Y 2M5 - Canada

Maxon may transfer personal data within the company group for the processing purposes listed in the section "Specific purposes of processing (including legal bases and legitimate interest)".

Legal basis for the processing of personal data in this context is consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR), insofar as we have obtained consent for such processing, the performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR), insofar as the processing is related to a contract with the person whose data is transferred, or our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in transferring the data within the company group for internal administrative purposes.

  
Transfer of personal data to partner companies (resellers/distributors)  
 

* For contractual purposes  
      
    A transfer of your personal data to third parties may be necessary for the provision of the service. Your personal data will then be transferred to the authorized distributor or reseller who is responsible for your geographic region and for the provision of services. According to your language selection on the website, your personal data will be forwarded to one of these [distributors or resellers](https://www.maxon.net/en/resellers).  
      
    The legal basis for the transfer of your personal data in this case is performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR).  
     
* For advertising purposes  
      
    Your personal data will only be transferred to third parties for advertising purposes with your express consent. Your personal data will then be transferred to the authorized distributor or reseller who is responsible for your geographic region. This distributor will then send you general information in connection with Maxon products via email. According to your language selection on the website, your personal data will be forwarded to one of these [distributors or resellers](https://www.maxon.net/en/resellers).  
      
    The legal basis for the forwarding of your personal data for advertising purposes is consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR).  
      
    You can withdraw your consent to the forwarding of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time with effect for the future. An informal communication, e.g., by email, is sufficient for the withdrawal of consent. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the withdrawal (see also "Rights of data subjects").

  
Other external third party recipients  
 

* We may transfer personal data to third parties (e.g. authorities, courts, lawyers, auditors, external agencies to combat piracy) where necessary to safeguard our rights or comply with legal obligations to which we are subject.  
      
    The legal basis for the forwarding of your personal data for the purpose of safeguarding our rights is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in establishing, exercising and defending legal claims. The legal basis for the forwarding of your personal data for the purpose of complying with legal obligations to which we are subject is compliance with the respective legal obligations (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR).

  
**Transfer to third countries**

A transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) only takes place if the requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are met. A third country is a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which the GDPR is not directly applicable.

We transfer your personal data to the USA or other third countries only if either  
 

* An adequacy decision has been adopted by the EU Commission with respect to the relevant third country (Art. 45 para. 1 GDPR), which particularly is the case for Canada (regarding commercial organizations), Japan and the United Kingdom;
* sufficient guarantees are provided by the recipient in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR for the protection of the personal data – for example, the conclusion of standard contractual clauses between us and the recipient with appropriate additional security measures (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR) or binding internal data protection rules approved by the competent data protection authorities (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. b GDPR); in this way, the recipient assures us that it will provide sufficient protection for the data and thus ensure a level of protection comparable to the GDPR; or
* one of the exceptions listed in Art. 49 GDPR applies – for example, your explicit consent (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) or if the transfer is necessary for the fulfillment of contractual obligations between you and us (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

The EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for the USA pursuant to Art. 45 para. 1 GDPR. According to the European Court of Justice in its judgment of 17 July 2020 (Case C-311/18, "Schrems II"), there is no level of data protection in the USA that would be comparable to that in the EU. When personal data is transferred to the U.S., there is a risk that U.S. authorities may gain access to the personal data on the basis of the PRISM and UPSTREAM surveillance programs based on Section 702 of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and on the basis of Executive Order 12333 or Presidential Police Directive 28. According to the European Court of Justice, EU citizens have no effective legal protection against such access in the USA or the EU. Due to this, we intend – where necessary – to agree on additional security measures with relevant recipients to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

If you would like to receive further information on international transfers of personal data or a copy of the relevant guarantees (Art. 46 GDPR) referenced above, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.maxon.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Data collection within the scope of the software – technical protection functions**

The prerequisite for using the software is registration on our website.

The software contains technical protection functions against piracy, unauthorized use and for the protection of our intellectual and industrial property rights and economic interest. This prevents the user from using the software in a way that violates the License Agreement.

**a.** The following personal data is processed as part of the technical protection functions:  
  
 

* IP address,
* Computer ID,
* Data related to use of the software,
* Eligibility data,
* Transaction data,
* Technical data.

We use technical protection functions to ensure the fulfillment of the License Agreement and to combat piracy and to protect the Software from unauthorized use.

In the event that the software is used in a manner that violates the License Agreement, your data will be disclosed to third parties. In the event that the violation has taken place outside the European Union, the personal data may also be transferred to this third country.

The legal basis for the use of personal data within the scope of technical protective functions as well as for any possible forwarding of this personal information to a third party is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in ensuring that our software is used in accordance with the relevant License Agreement.

The processing of your data serves the purpose of being able to trace unauthorized use of the software as well as license infringements so Maxon can in such cases prevent such unauthorized use and take measures against license infringement. The forwarding of your data to third parties serves the purpose of pursuing unauthorized use of the software or license infringement in other countries, for example.

Your data will be deleted as soon as the purpose for which they were saved has been achieved and they are no longer needed and no legal obligations for retention – in particular with regard to trade or tax law retention provisions – exist and the data are not required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. In accordance with this, your data will be saved at least as long as Maxon can pursue the unauthorized use of the software or license infringement.  
  
 

**b.** The personal data collected within the scope of the technical protection functions, in particular the computer ID, can be linked with personal data that was collected within the scope of registration for a MyMaxon account. Conclusions can therefore be made regarding an individual that has or is using the software in a manner contrary to the License Agreement.

In the event that the software was or is being used in a manner contrary to the License Agreement the combined personal data will also be forwarded to third parties. In the event that the infringement took place outside of the European Union, the combined personal data will also be forwarded to this third country.

The legal basis for the lining of personal data collected within the scope of the technical protection functions with the personal data collected within the scope of registration for a MyMaxon account as well as the forwarding of this information to third parties is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in ensuring that our software is used in accordance with the relevant License Agreement and identifying who is violating said agreement.

The linking of personal data serves the purpose of identifying and contacting persons who use the software in a manner contrary to the License Agreement. This serves to ensure the authorized use of the software and protect against violations.

Forwarding the combined personal data servers, the purpose of supporting Maxon’s pursuit of unauthorized use of the software or breaches of the License Agreement in foreign countries, for example.

The link between personal data will be removed as soon as the purpose for which it was linked no longer exists and no legal obligations for maintaining this link remain and the linked data is not required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

We may request information from you in order to verify your identity. Additionally, we may require that authorized agents provide proof of their authorization. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we are unable to verify your identity, your authority to make a request on behalf of another person, or if we cannot confirm that the personal information relates to you. In general, we will verify your request and your identity by matching the information you provided with the information we have in our records.

You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know, or to submit a request to delete your personal information or opt-out of sales of your personal information.

We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.

Transfers of Personal Information Outside of China

Where required by applicable laws, we will put in place appropriate measures to ensure that processing of your personal information outside of the People’s Republic of China is safeguarded by the equivalent level of data protection as in the People’s Republic of China.
