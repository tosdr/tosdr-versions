General Data Processing

**Scope of processing of personal data**  

We process personal data that we receive in the course of your visit to our Website, if you contact us or use our services.  
  

**Legal basis for the processing of personal data**

When processing personal data, we rely on the following legal bases:  
  

* the performance of a contract to which the affected person (the "**data subject**") is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (this also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures)
* legitimate interests of our company or a third party, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former mentioned interests
* fulfillment of legal obligations to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR
* consent, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR

The purposes for which we process personal data, relevant legal bases and specific legitimate interests (where legitimate interests are the basis for processing) are stated further below.

**  
Data processing by processors  
  
**

* In some cases, we use external service providers to process personal data (e.g., service providers for customer management, service providers for invoice management, IT service providers). These have been carefully selected by us and commissioned in accordance with data protection requirements, are bound by our instructions and are regularly monitored.  
      
    

**Transfer of personal data to other external recipients (third parties)**

Various external recipients, which are not engaged as processors as outlined in the section above "Data processing by processors", may receive your personal data. Such external recipients are also called third parties. A data transfer to these external recipients may take place for the performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR), if a corresponding consent has been given (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b , Art. 7 GDPR), based on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) or if it is required by law (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR).

  
Recipients within the company group

NEMETSCHEK SE - Konrad-Zuse-Platz 1 - 81829 Munich - Germany

Maxon Computer Inc. - 515 Marin St., Ste 322, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 - USA

Maxon Computer Ltd. - 114 High Street, Cranfield - Bedfordshire, MK43 0DG - United Kingdom

Maxon Computer Canada Inc. - 434, rue St.-Pierre, bureau 400, Montréal, Québec, H2Y 2M5 - Canada

Maxon may transfer personal data within the company group for the processing purposes listed in the section "Specific purposes of processing (including legal bases and legitimate interest)".

Legal basis for the processing of personal data in this context is consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR), insofar as we have obtained consent for such processing, the performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR), insofar as the processing is related to a contract with the person whose data is transferred, or our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in transferring the data within the company group for internal administrative purposes.

  
Transfer of personal data to partner companies (resellers/distributors)  
  

* For contractual purposes  
      
    A transfer of your personal data to third parties may be necessary for the provision of the service. Your personal data will then be transferred to the authorized distributor or reseller who is responsible for your geographic region and for the provision of services. According to your language selection on the website, your personal data will be forwarded to one of these [distributors or resellers](https://www.maxon.net/en/resellers).  
      
    The legal basis for the transfer of your personal data in this case is performance of a contract (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR).

* For advertising purposes  
      
    Your personal data will only be transferred to third parties for advertising purposes with your express consent. Your personal data will then be transferred to the authorized distributor or reseller who is responsible for your geographic region. This distributor will then send you general information in connection with Maxon products via email. According to your language selection on the website, your personal data will be forwarded to one of these [distributors or resellers](https://www.maxon.net/en/resellers).  
      
    The legal basis for the forwarding of your personal data for advertising purposes is consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a, Art. 7 GDPR).  
      
    You can withdraw your consent to the forwarding of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time with effect for the future. An informal communication, e.g., by email, is sufficient for the withdrawal of consent. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the withdrawal (see also "Rights of data subjects").

  
Other external third party recipients  
  

* We may transfer personal data to third parties (e.g. authorities, courts, lawyers, auditors, external agencies to combat piracy) where necessary to safeguard our rights or comply with legal obligations to which we are subject.  
      
    The legal basis for the forwarding of your personal data for the purpose of safeguarding our rights is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in establishing, exercising and defending legal claims. The legal basis for the forwarding of your personal data for the purpose of complying with legal obligations to which we are subject is compliance with the respective legal obligations (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR).

**  
Transfer to third countries**

A transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) only takes place if the requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR are met. A third country is a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which the GDPR is not directly applicable.

We transfer your personal data to the USA or other third countries only if either  
  

* An adequacy decision has been adopted by the EU Commission with respect to the relevant third country (Art. 45 para. 1 GDPR), which particularly is the case for Canada (regarding commercial organizations), Japan and the United Kingdom;
* sufficient guarantees are provided by the recipient in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR for the protection of the personal data – for example, the conclusion of standard contractual clauses between us and the recipient with appropriate additional security measures (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR) or binding internal data protection rules approved by the competent data protection authorities (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. b GDPR); in this way, the recipient assures us that it will provide sufficient protection for the data and thus ensure a level of protection comparable to the GDPR; or
* one of the exceptions listed in Art. 49 GDPR applies – for example, your explicit consent (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) or if the transfer is necessary for the fulfillment of contractual obligations between you and us (Art. 49 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

The EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision for the USA pursuant to Art. 45 para. 1 GDPR. According to the European Court of Justice in its judgment of 17 July 2020 (Case C-311/18, "Schrems II"), there is no level of data protection in the USA that would be comparable to that in the EU. When personal data is transferred to the U.S., there is a risk that U.S. authorities may gain access to the personal data on the basis of the PRISM and UPSTREAM surveillance programs based on Section 702 of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and on the basis of Executive Order 12333 or Presidential Police Directive 28. According to the European Court of Justice, EU citizens have no effective legal protection against such access in the USA or the EU. Due to this, we intend – where necessary – to agree on additional security measures with relevant recipients to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

If you would like to receive further information on international transfers of personal data or a copy of the relevant guarantees (Art. 46 GDPR) referenced above, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.maxon.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

In the event that the software was or is being used in a manner contrary to the License Agreement the combined personal data will also be forwarded to third parties. In the event that the infringement took place outside of the European Union, the combined personal data will also be forwarded to this third country.

The legal basis for the lining of personal data collected within the scope of the technical protection functions with the personal data collected within the scope of registration for a MyMaxon account as well as the forwarding of this information to third parties is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR) in ensuring that our software is used in accordance with the relevant License Agreement and identifying who is violating said agreement.

**_Requests to Opt-Out of Sales of Your Personal Information._** To exercise your right to opt-out of sales of your personal information, you may submit a request form via our website at this [link](https://www.maxon.net/en/about-maxon/contact). You may also submit a request by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.maxon.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**_Verification of Requests._** Only you, or an individual legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know, delete, or opt-out related to your personal information. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us by using the contact information above.

You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period to the extent you are exercising a right under the CCPA. Your request to know or delete must:  
  

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or that the requestor is your authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We may request information from you in order to verify your identity. Additionally, we may require that authorized agents provide proof of their authorization. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we are unable to verify your identity, your authority to make a request on behalf of another person, or if we cannot confirm that the personal information relates to you. In general, we will verify your request and your identity by matching the information you provided with the information we have in our records.

You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know, or to submit a request to delete your personal information or opt-out of sales of your personal information.

We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.

Transfers of Personal Information Outside of China

If you are resident in China, with your separate consent, we may transfer, access or store your personal information outside of the People’s Republic of China where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the integrity and security of your personal information or adequate security measures are adopted and in compliance with applicable laws, such as contractual arrangements. Where required by applicable laws, we will put in place appropriate measures to ensure that processing of your personal information outside of the People’s Republic of China is safeguarded by the equivalent level of data protection as in the People’s Republic of China.

Security of Your Personal Information

We have implemented reasonable and appropriate security precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust, unique password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

Minors

We do not knowingly collect or process personal information of minors under the age of 14 without the consent of their parents or guardians, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. We will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible should we become aware of minors’ personal information. Parents or guardians can contact us to request such deletion.
