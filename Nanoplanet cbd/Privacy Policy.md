Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through NanoPlanet CBD's public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.

We do not collect any personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain personal information to us when you elect to use certain products, subscriptions or services. These may include: (a) registering for an account; (b) entering a sweepstakes or contest sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) signing up for special offers from selected third parties; (d) sending us an email message; (e) submitting your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services. To wit, we will use your information for, but not limited to, communicating with you in relation to services and/or products you have requested from us.

#### Automatically Collected Information

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by NanoPlanet CBD. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the NanoPlanet CBD website.

#### Use of Cookies

The NanoPlanet CBD website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize NanoPlanet CBD pages, or register with NanoPlanet CBD site or services, a cookie helps NanoPlanet CBD to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same NanoPlanet CBD website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the NanoPlanet CBD features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the NanoPlanet CBD services or websites you visit.

#### Security of your Personal Information

NanoPlanet CBD secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. NanoPlanet CBD uses the following methods for this purpose:

* SSL Protocol
* SSL Certificate by Comodo
* Website Security by iThemes Security
* Additional Security by WP Security

When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.

* Delete your personal information from our records

* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity
* Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality

* Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act
