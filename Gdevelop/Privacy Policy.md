### Your Rights and Choices in the EEA and Around the World

Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”) applies to the processing of your personal data, especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have the following rights, subject to some limitations, against us:

* The right to access your personal data;
* The right to rectify the personal data we hold about you;
* The right to erase your personal data;
* The right to restrict our use of your personal data;
* The right to object to our use of your personal data;
* The right to receive your personal data in a usable electronic format and transmit it to a third party (also known as the right of data portability); and
* The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so by mailing _[\[email protected\]](https://gdevelop.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)_. Please understand, however, the rights enumerated above are not absolute in all cases.

Where the GDPR applies, you also have the right to withdraw any consent you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have previously provided to us, you may do so by mailing _[\[email protected\]](https://gdevelop.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)_. However, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

We will undertake best efforts to provide these rights to people outside of the EEA as well.

### Children’s Privacy

These Services can only be used by children under 13 with parental permission and supervision: parent, legal guardian or a teacher/educator having full management of the account.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this personally identifiable information from our servers. If you are a parent, guardian, teacher/educator and you are aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

Note that if the personally identifiable information is contained inside the email address of the account itself, we will remove the account. We recommend teachers, educators or parents willing to have children under 13 to use GDevelop to use the Education plan which provides fully anonymous accounts.
