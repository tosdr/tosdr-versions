Terms _&_ Conditions
====================

For when using our services and websites.

### Terms & Conditions  
Overview

Welcome to GDevelop! Our platform provides access to GDevelop open-source game creation technology alongside with a range of complementary services.

  
This website ( [https://gdevelop.io](https://gdevelop.io/)), related websites ( [https://forum.gdevelop.io](https://forum.gdevelop.io/), [https://wiki.gdevelop.io](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/), [https://editor.gdevelop.io](https://editor.gdevelop.io/), [https://gd.games](https://gd.games/), [https://liluo.io](https://liluo.io/)), related applications (GDevelop), or related online services, referred to as the Service, are operated by GDevelop Ltd and/or its subsidiaries like GDevelop France SAS.

The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to GDevelop Ltd and/or its subsidiaries like GDevelop France SAS. GDevelop Ltd offers these websites, applications and online services, including all information, tools and services available from this site to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here.

  

### 1\. Terms

  
By accessing our Service, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing our website, related websites, related applications or related online services. The materials contained in these websites and related applications are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

  
The headings used in this agreement are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.  

### 2\. Use License

GDevelop Ltd develops an open-source, MIT-licensed technology which is accessible on developer platforms like GitHub.

While this technology can be accessed freely through these developer platforms and is covered by the MIT license, GDevelop Ltd maintains complementary services and makes this technology accessible through our Service (this website, related websites, related applications and related online services), including in particular an official, commercially supported application that can be accessed or downloaded through this website or app stores (including but not limited to Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Microsoft Store).  

We reserve the right to refuse access or usage to our Service to anyone for any reason at any time.  
  
You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the Service, any part of the Service, or our trademarks in any way - except for parts of the Service that are open-source and licensed under the MIT license. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions - except for parts of the Service that are open-source and licensed under the MIT license. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to GDevelop Ltd or Florian Rival.

  
GDevelop Ltd is committed to ensuring that our Service is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.  

### 3\. Disclaimer

  
The materials on the Service are provided on an 'as is' basis. GDevelop Ltd makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, GDevelop Ltd does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites or applications linked to this Service.

  
The applications and websites of this Service store and process personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide the Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your device and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, tablet or computer, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the GDevelop applications and the websites of the Service won’t work properly or at all.  

### 4\. Limitations

  
We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free.

  
You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the service at any time, without notice to you.  
You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service and all products and Services delivered to you through the service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is' and 'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement.

In no case shall GDevelop Ltd, GDevelop France SAS, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

  
Certain functions of the Service will require the Service to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but GDevelop Ltd cannot take responsibility for the Service not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

  
If you’re using the Service outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the Service, or other third party charges. In using the Service, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Service outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the Service, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the Service.  
Along the same lines, GDevelop Ltd cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the Service i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, GDevelop Ltd cannot accept responsibility.

  
With respect to GDevelop Ltd’s responsibility for your use of the Service, when you’re using the Service, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. GDevelop Ltd accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.  
When the website or application is used to produce content, like games or applications, these contents are under the responsibility of their own author. In no event shall GDevelop Ltd be liable for any damages arising out of the use of these contents. GDevelop Ltd cannot take responsibility of the proper working or lawfulness of these contents. Lawfulness, warranty, limitations, terms and conditions and privacy policies of these contents are the responsibility of their own author.
