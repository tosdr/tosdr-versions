Terms of Service
================

  

Eighty Percent Solutions Corporation DBA Freedom.to is a Delaware business corporation (hereafter "EPS," "we," or "us") that is the creator and provider of the software service product Freedom (https://freedom.to) and subsidiary programs (group subscriptions, apps, plugins, extensions, etc.). By using online and offline products and services (collectively, "the Service"), provided by EPS you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service ("TOS"). The TOS may be updated by us from time to time without notice. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: https://freedom.to/terms.

###### Use of the service

In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent and warrant that (i) you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction and (ii) your use of the Service does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For more information, see our full privacy policy at https://freedom.to/privacy. You understand that through your use of the Service you consent to the collection and use (as set out in the Privacy Policy) of this information. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service unless you otherwise have an agreement with us which specifically grants you such right(s).

###### Orders and payment

When you license software from the Service, your license covers all of your personal devices for the operating systems and operating system levels we support. If you have access to the service as a result of a gift or group subscription, then as an individual user and license holder of the Service, you are subject to the same TOS (see below for further information on our group subscription terms).

Service licenses are recurring in nature, should you wish to discontinue recurring payment or cancel your subscription, you may manage your account directly from your [profile](https://freedom.to/profile). If you have purchased your subscription through the Apple App Store, you can manage your subscription with your [Apple account](https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/DirectAction/manageSubscriptions). If you have purchased your subscription through Google Play, you can manage your subscriptions directly within the Google Play app. Finally, if you run into any trouble managing your subscription, you are welcome to reach out to our [\[email protected\]](https://freedom.to/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), who will guide you through the process.

###### Group subscriptions and business use

When you access, join, or create a group ("Designated Enterprise") through the group functionalities on the Service (Freedom for Teams), you agree to be bound by these Terms. The user who creates the group will be given administrative control over the group ("Group Administrator"). As administrator they may invite any employee with a workplace-designated email address to join the group, up to a maximum number of users as designated by the group subscription plan purchased.

The Group Administrator's control includes the ability to admit new users, and remove users who do not comply with these Terms and any additional guidelines as set out by the Group Administrator in their discretion, provided such discretion is in accordance with these Terms. For workplace groups, the Group Administrator will be responsible for permitting only Designated Enterprise employees to join, use, and access the workplace group(s).

It is the Group Administrator's responsibility to confirm the employment status of each user for the applicable workplace group. Notwithstanding the above, Freedom reserves the right, to the extent the Designated Enterprise wishes to assume control over workplace group(s) associated with its employees, to provide all administrative rights, functionality, and control directly to the Designated Enterprise's assigned administrator ("Designated Enterprise Administrator"). In such instances, the Group Administrator will immediately provide the Designated Enterprise and Designated Enterprise Administrator control over the workplace group.

If you register as either the Group Administrator or the Designated Enterprise Administrator you represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permission from the Designated Enterprise to have access and control over the Freedom for Teams Admin Dashboard.

Our personal-use license allows the use of Freedom on a individual's business-owned or leased devices. In other words, you are welcome to use Freedom on a device provided to you by another organization. Our personal-use license does not permit use by multiple individuals on business-owned or leased devices. Should you need a business license or group subscription, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://freedom.to/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

###### Affiliate & referral program

The Freedom Affiliate Program rewards you for referring your friends, family, colleagues to use our distraction blocking software. After you apply on the [Impact registration page](https://app.impact.com/campaign-promo-signup/Freedom.brand?execution=e1s1&__cf_chl_tk=WZCiZAXnEjZeQBMO6EPqGtKToFSJu75hSAB4Z.nM14w-1660035419-0-gaNycGzNEOU), your application will be submitted for approval into the program. Once approved, you can access your account and start sharing links/banners. Visitors can click and purchase a subscription through the links/banners and if the referral account remains in good standing past 30 days, you will be credited for the commission. Freedom affiliates earn a standard commission rate of 10% for all referrals.

There may be instances where an individual or company refers The Services to their audience, partners, colleagues and/or community. In these instances, Freedom may also, subject to negotiation and specific agreements, agree in advance to pay a commission or reward (financial or otherwise) on these purchases.

We reserve the right to reverse commissions due to refunded payments and erroneous subscription crediting. All affiliates must comply with all federal, state and local regulations within your jurisdiction. This includes applicable laws governing marketing emails (e.g. CAN-SPAM Act), and all other anti-spam laws. Freedom reserves the right to suspend or remove affiliates from our affiliate program at any time, without warning. Upon termination you agree to discontinue use of all links, logos, banners and promotional materials provided to you. Affiliates terminated due to malicious publishing tactics will also have commissions revoked and face possible omission from the Impact network.
