Ethics/Safety Line
------------------

A confidential third-party Ethics/Safety Line is provided through Lighthouse Services as a service to assist any member of the University community with reporting concerns or issues about questionable practices. These may include fraud, unlawful, unethical, or other types of behavior. Regular business matters that do not require anonymity should be directed to the employee’s supervisor and should not be submitted using this service.

Every employee and member of the community can play a vital part in helping Clemson maintain its integrity. Most incidences are discovered as a result of tips provided by individuals who are closest to the activity.

Issues may be reported 24 hours a day by calling 1-877-503-7283 or by visiting the website. It is not necessary to identify yourself, but it would help in case further information is needed. Your privacy is respected, and conversations are confidential. Every effort is made to protect your anonymity.

**Toll Free: 1-877-503-7283 (1-877-50FRAUD) — Available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Leave a message.**
