Terms of Use
============

Welcome to gradescope.com, a website and online service of Turnitin, LLC. (“Turnitin,” “we,” or “us”). In 2018, Gradescope joined Turnitin, a leading provider of academic integrity and writing assessment solutions. Since that time, as we’ve continued to improve and support the Gradescope product you know and love, we’ve also been settling into our new home. This has included improving our policies and practices, including but not limited to those around privacy and security. As a result, we are adopting a new, companywide privacy policy, and we’ve updated our Terms of Service below. If you have any questions or concerns about the changes, as always please reach out to us at [help@gradescope.com](mailto:help@gradescope.com).

This page explains the terms by which you may use the Gradescope online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with all of Turnitin’s Gradescope service (the “Service”).

By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the [Gradescope Privacy Policy](https://www.gradescope.com/privacy) whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. Turnitin reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. These Terms applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).

In the event that Turnitin and any School (as defined below) have entered into a separate agreement for the Services, such agreement shall govern to the extent that any terms directly conflict with the provisions of these Terms.

**We have provided headings and summaries in each section for your convenience; however, the summaries are not meant to limit the Terms and shall not affect or limit in any way the meaning or interpretation of the Terms.**

### Student Data

Student Data may include “educational records” as defined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g).

You acknowledge and agree that, as between the parties, you are solely responsible for any and all Student Data, whether provided by Teacher, School, Student or any other third-party.

### Third-Party Access

By submitting Student Data to Gradescope, you consent to allow Gradescope to provide access to Student Data to its employees and to certain third party service providers which have a legitimate need to access such information in connection with their responsibilities in providing the Service. Gradescope and its employees, subcontractors, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data that includes personally identifiable information and shall not redisclose such data except as necessary in order to provide the Service or pursuant to the consent and direction of School or a Student over age 18.

You further agree that Turnitin will have the right, both during and after the Term of these Terms, to use, store, transmit, distribute, modify, copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of the de-identified, aggregated or anonymized data solely for the purposes of improving Turnitin services.

### Deletion Requests

15\. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
-------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Summary:** We are based in California, and any disputes will be arbitrated here. All claims must be brought in the party’s individual capacity.

### Governing Law.

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Each party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California in connection with any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, to recover damages or other relief under this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or by reason of this Agreement.

### Arbitration

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TURNITIN. For any dispute with Turnitin, you agree to first contact us at [legal@turnitin.com](mailto:legal@turnitin.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Turnitin has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless you and Turnitin agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Turnitin from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.

### Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.

WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TURNITIN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

16\. General

### Entire Agreement/Severability

These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Turnitin in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Turnitin concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.

### No Waiver

No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Turnitin’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
