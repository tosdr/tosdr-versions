You waive any and all objections to exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

#### 17\. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.**

In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, WEBTOON and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of the Services or the Agreement (“Dispute”) will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:

a) **Notice of Dispute**. In the event of a Dispute, you or WEBTOON must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a “Notice of Dispute”). You must send any Notice of Dispute by registered mail to WEBTOON at NAVER Green Factory 6-10F, 6, Buljeong-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea Attention: Legal Department and also via e-mail to [dl\_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com](mailto:dl_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com). WEBTOON will send any Notice of Dispute to you by e-mail address or registered mail to your address if WEBTOON has it. You and WEBTOON will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or WEBTOON may commence arbitration. An arbitrator will decide any disputes over whether this subsection has been violated, and has the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitrator shall not administer any arbitration unless the requirements of this subsection have been met.

c) **Class Action Waiver**. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor WEBTOON will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; for example, you may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Service users. Nor may an arbitrator consolidate arbitrations unless all parties agree. If there is a final judicial determination that the limitations of this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

d) **Mass Arbitrations**. If 25 or more claimants submit similar Notices of Dispute or file similar arbitrations and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in stages using staged bellwether proceedings. You agree to do this even though the resolution of some claims might be delayed. In the first stage, the parties shall select up to 10 cases to be filed in arbitration and resolved by separate arbitrators. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration. Nor may the arbitration provider accept, administer or demand payment for fees for other arbitrations. If the remaining cases are not settled after the first stage is done, the parties will repeat the process. These staged bellwether proceedings will continue until all cases are resolved. If this subsection applies to a Notice of Dispute, any statute of limitations applicable to the listed claims will be tolled from the time the first cases are selected for bellwether proceedings until the claimant’s Notice of Dispute is selected for a bellwether proceeding or otherwise resolved. A court will have the authority to enforce this subsection, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations or assessment of related fees.

e) **Arbitration Procedures**. Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”) in effect at the time the Dispute is filed. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, WEBTOON and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.

f) **Arbitration Fees**. Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee. If WEBTOON files, then WEBTOON will pay; if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses (including attorney’s fees) from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.

g) **Filing Period**. To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins on the earliest date when any of the alleged claims first accrue, regardless of whether additional damages occur after such claims first accrue. If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

h) **Opt-Out**. You can opt out of arbitration within 30 days of the date that you first agreed to the Agreement (including any earlier version). If you have previously agreed to arbitration, then you may opt out of any future revisions to the arbitration provision within 30 days of receiving notice of the updated arbitration provision, in which case the prior version of the arbitration shall apply. To opt out of arbitration (or revisions to this arbitration provision), you must send your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your Services account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement (or of the revisions to it), and you must send them here: [dl\_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com](mailto:dl_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com).

i) WEBTOON AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND SUBCONTRACTORS ARE INTENDED AS THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSES IN THIS SECTION 17.

#### 18\. Complete Agreement and Severability.

The Agreement is the entire agreement between you and WEBTOON regarding the Services and/or Digital Content, and supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter. If any term or condition of the Agreement is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term or condition.

Toute préoccupation concernant un tel service ou ressource tiers ou un lien vers celui-ci doit être adressée au service ou à la ressource tiers en question.

#### 10\. Achat et échange de Coins.

Certains aspects de notre Service peuvent inclure un contenu qui nécessite l'échange de Coins. Vous pouvez accéder à ce contenu en « achetant » et/ou en « gagnant » des Coins. Vous ne possédez pas les Coins, que vous les ayez « achetés » et/ou « gagnés » ou non. Les Coins ne constituent pas des biens réels quelle que soit la loi applicable. En outre, les Coins ne représentent pas et ne peuvent pas être échangés contre une valeur monétaire du « monde réel ». Une licence limitée, non transférable, révocable et non exclusive vous est accordée pour l'utilisation personnelle des Coins uniquement pour accéder à certains contenus liés aux Services.

a) Les Coins vous sont fournis par les moyens spécifiés par WEBTOON tels que les achats, les offres spéciales et autres. Les détails concernant les méthodes de paiement, les unités et toutes les autres conditions relatives aux Coins sont définies par WEBTOON et affichés en conséquence sur les Services.

b) Les Coins ne peuvent pas être échangés ou être utilisés dans un autre but que celui d'accéder à certains contenus proposés par les Services. WEBTOON se réserve le droit de modifier le prix d'achat des Coins à tout moment. Le nombre de Coins requis pour accéder au contenu peut être modifié et est en tout état de cause affiché sur le Service. Les conditions applicables à votre accès et/ou à l'échange de Coins sont celles en vigueur à la date de votre accès et/ou de votre utilisation du contenu, telles qu’affichées sur le Service.

c) La valeur d’achat des Coins associés à votre compte ne peut à aucun moment dépasser 2 000 $ (ou l’équivalent en devise locale).

d) Dans la limite prévue au point c) et en tout état de cause, vous ne pouvez acheter, au total et sur tous les comptes que vous détenez, plus de 10 000 $ (ou l’équivalent en devise locale) de Coins par jour.

e) Bien que nous n'y soyons pas tenus, nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l'achat de Coins lorsque nous soupçonnons qu'une transaction est initiée sans autorisation, de manière frauduleuse ou suspecte, ou qu'elle est inhabituelle sur la base de transactions antérieures.

f) Nous pouvons, à notre seule discrétion, modifier ou limiter à tout moment et à tout montant le solde maximal de Coins détenus sur votre compte et la valeur maximale des Coins que vous pouvez acheter.

g) Les Coins ne peuvent être utilisés que par le compte qui les a achetés et/ou gagnés. En outre, les Coins ne peuvent pas être transférés entre des appareils fonctionnant sur des systèmes d'exploitation différents, même s'ils sont utilisés pour le même compte, et ils ne peuvent pas non plus être utilisés dans différentes langues de contenu. Par exemple, les Coins achetés à partir d'un compte utilisant un système iOS pour accéder à du contenu en anglais ne peuvent pas être utilisés à partir d'un système Android pour accéder à du contenu en espagnol (même en utilisant le même compte).

h) Vous acceptez que toutes les ventes de Coins conclues entre WEBTOON et vous sont définitives et ne sont pas remboursables pour quelque raison que ce soit, à moins que les lois applicables l'exigent ou si nous décidons, à notre seule discrétion, d'annuler votre achat de Coins.

i) WEBTOON peut occasionnellement offrir des Coins promotionnels que vous ne payez pas, notamment les Coins que nous vous offrons à la suite de votre téléchargement et/ou votre achat de l'Application WEBTOON ou d'autres produits, votre utilisation des Services ou toute autre activité promotionnelle (« Coins Gratuits »). Les Coins Gratuits peuvent expirer après une certaine période de temps, que WEBTOON définit le cas échéant. Lorsque vous échangez des Coins pour accéder à un contenu, les Coins Gratuits dont vous disposez sur votre compte seront utilisés en premier, suivis des Coins achetés.

j) Vous n'êtes pas autorisé à transférer les Coins en dehors des Services (par exemple en les vendant, en les offrant ou en les échangeant), ni à accorder des sous-licences, échanger, vendre ou tenter de vendre des Coins contre de l'argent réel, ou bien à échanger des Coins contre une valeur quelconque en dehors des Services. Tout transfert de ce type est interdit et nul.

k) Moyennant un préavis d'un (1) mois, nous pouvons, pour des raisons commerciales ou techniques, interrompre l'utilisation de Coins sur nos Services. Dans ce cas, tous les Coins non utilisés expireront à la date d'interruption indiquée.

l) Pour les utilisateurs d’iOS uniquement : les Coins peuvent être achetés sans se connecter à un compte. Toutefois, si vous choisissez d'acheter et/ou d'utiliser des Coins sans vous connecter à votre compte, les Coins achetés et les épisodes déverrouillés (« Articles achetés ») seront uniquement stockés sur votre appareil. Cela signifie que vous ne pourrez pas transférer les Articles achetés sur un autre appareil et que, si vous supprimez l'Application WEBTOON de votre appareil, tous les Articles achetés seront supprimés définitivement et ne pourront pas être restaurés, même si l'Application WEBTOON est réinstallée.

#### 11\. Frais.

L’achat de Coins ou l'utilisation de certaines fonctionnalités des Services peut occasionner le paiement de frais à WEBTOON (« Frais de service »). Vous êtes responsable du paiement de tous les Frais de service applicables indiqués sur les Services au moment de l'achat. Si ces Frais de service sont spécifiés comme étant récurrents sur les Services, vous acceptez que WEBTOON puisse facturer ces Frais de service sur une base périodique au moyen de la méthode de paiement que vous avez indiquée au moment de votre achat initial (votre « Moyen de paiement »). En utilisant un Moyen de paiement pour payer les Frais de service, vous acceptez expressément que WEBTOON soit autorisé à débiter le Moyen de paiement des Frais de service et de tous les autres frais pour des Services supplémentaires que vous pourriez acheter, ainsi que toutes les taxes applicables. Vous reconnaissez et acceptez que les Frais de service puissent augmenter à tout moment. Des frais supplémentaires peuvent s'appliquer pour de nouvelles fonctionnalités ou des ajouts au Service qui peuvent être mis à disposition, auquel cas WEBTOON vous en informera avant de facturer les frais supplémentaires. Dans le cas où WEBTOON facturerait des frais supplémentaires en rapport avec les Services, vous aurez la possibilité d'examiner et d'accepter les frais supplémentaires qui vous seront facturés, avant d'être facturé. Vous reconnaissez et acceptez que WEBTOON recourt à des prestataires de services de paiement pour traiter les Frais de service en notre nom, et que WEBTOON ne sera pas tenu responsable des erreurs causées par lesdits prestataires de services de paiement.

#### 12\. Droit de rétractation et Résiliation.

a) **Droit de rétractation.** Vous disposez d'un droit de rétractation de 14 jours pour l'achat de Coins, sans avoir à justifier votre décision.

#### 13\. Garanties.

En tant que consommateur, vous bénéficiez de la garantie légale de conformité et de la garantie légale contre les vices cachés prévues par la réglementation française relative à la protection des consommateurs. Pour exercer ces droits, veuillez nous contacter à [Customer Care](https://contact-cc.line.me/serviceId/12379/fr/?continue_without_login=true) ou à NAVER WEBTOON Ltd., NAVER Green Factory 6-10F, 6, Buljeong-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea (Attention: EU Service), [webtoonofficiel@webtoonscorp.com](mailto:webtoonofficiel@webtoonscorp.com) our les besoins des mentions légales ci-dessous, le terme " consommateur " désigne " vous ", le terme " professionnel " désigne " WEBTOON " et le terme " X " désigne " la ou les périodes contractuelles de fourniture des Contenus Numériques ou Services qui sont proposés par WEBTOON telles qu'indiquées dans les conditions applicables sur le Site WEBTOON et/ou l'Application WEBTOON ".

1) Lorsque le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est fourni ponctuellement

Le consommateur dispose d'un délai de deux ans à compter de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique pour obtenir la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d'apparition d'un défaut de conformité. Durant un délai d'un an à compter de la date de fourniture, le consommateur n'est tenu d'établir que l'existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d'apparition de celui-ci.  
La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique.  
La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui.  
Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service numérique, si :  
1° Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;  
2° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;  
3° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;  
4° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;  
5° La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.  
Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu'il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n'est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable.  
Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n'a droit à l'annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d'un prix.  
Toute période d'indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu'à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme.  
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus résultent de l'application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation.  
Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d'un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu'à 10 % du chiffre d'affaires moyen annuel (article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation).  
Le consommateur bénéficie, en outre, de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique.

2) Lorsque le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est fourni de manière continue

Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d'apparition d'un défaut de conformité durant un délai de X à compter de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n'est tenu d'établir que l'existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d'apparition de celui-ci.  
La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant X.  
La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui.  
Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service numérique, si :  
1° Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;  
2° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;  
3° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;  
4° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;  
5° La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.  
Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu'il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n'est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable.  
Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n'a droit à l'annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d'un prix.  
Toute période d'indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu'à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme.  
Ces droits résultent de l'application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation.  
Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d'un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu'à 10 % du chiffre d'affaires moyen annuel (article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation).

Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique.

#### 14\. Limitation de responsabilité.

Nous ne saurions exclure ou limiter de quelque manière que ce soit notre responsabilité à votre égard lorsqu'il serait illégal de le faire. Nonobstant l'article 13, nous déclinons toute responsabilité en cas d'inexécution qui vous serait imputable ou qui serait due au fait imprévisible et insurmontable d'un tiers ou à un cas de force majeure.  
Conformément aux articles 4 et 6, les Services sont mis à disposition pour un usage personnel et non commercial. En conséquence, nous déclinons toute responsabilité à votre égard pour les pertes commerciales, y compris notamment toute perte de profit, perte d'activité, interruption d'activité ou perte d'opportunité commerciale.

#### 15\. Droit applicable ; Litiges.

Le Contrat est régi par les lois de l'État de Californie, sans donner effet à aucune disposition ou règle de choix ou de conflit de lois.

La Commission européenne met à la disposition des consommateurs une plateforme de résolution des litiges en ligne, à laquelle vous pouvez accéder ici : [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).

#### 16\. Intégralité du Contrat et divisibilité.

Si l'une des dispositions du Contrat est jugée invalide, nulle ou inapplicable pour quelque raison que ce soit, cette partie sera considérée comme dissociable et n'affectera pas la validité et l'applicabilité d’une quelconque autre disposition.

Sebagai gantinya, semua Sengketa akan diselesaikan di hadapan arbiter netral, yang keputusannya bersifat final kecuali untuk hak banding terbatas berdasarkan Undang-Undang Arbitrase Federal. Arbiter harus memutuskan semua masalah yang berkaitan dengan arbitrabilitas, termasuk keabsahan yurisdiksinya sendiri dan keberlakuan Perjanjian (misalnya, tidak beralasan). Untuk menghindari keraguan, hal ini tidak dimaksudkan untuk mengurangi kewenangan apa pun yang diberikan kepada arbiter berdasarkan aturan JAMS yang berlaku. Tempat arbitrase adalah Los Angeles, California. Pengadilan mana pun dengan yurisdiksi atas para pihak dapat menegakkan keputusan arbiter.

c) Pengesampingan Gugatan kelompok. Proses apa pun untuk menyelesaikan atau menuntut Sengketa apa pun dalam forum apa pun akan dilakukan semata-mata secara individual. Baik Anda maupun WEBTOON tidak akan meminta agar Sengketa apa pun didengar sebagai gugatan kelompok atau dalam proses lainnya di mana salah satu pihak bertindak atau mengusulkan untuk bertindak dalam kapasitas perwakilan. Tidak ada arbitrase atau proses yang akan digabungkan dengan yang lain tanpa persetujuan tertulis sebelumnya dari semua pihak untuk semua arbitrase atau proses yang terkena dampak. Gugatan kelompok dan arbitrase kelas tidak diizinkan; misalnya, Anda dapat mengajukan klaim hanya atas nama Anda sendiri dan tidak dapat meminta ganti rugi yang akan memengaruhi pengguna Layanan lainnya. Arbiter juga tidak boleh mengkonsolidasikan arbitrase kecuali semua pihak setuju. Jika ada keputusan yudisial akhir bahwa pembatasan ayat ini tidak dapat dilaksanakan untuk klaim tertentu atau permintaan bantuan tertentu (seperti permintaan ganti rugi), maka para pihak setuju bahwa klaim atau permintaan bantuan tersebut harus diputuskan oleh pengadilan setelah semua klaim dan permintaan bantuan lainnya diarbitrase.

d) Arbitrase Massal. Jika 25 atau lebih penggugat mengajukan Pemberitahuan Sengketa yang serupa atau mengajukan arbitrase yang serupa dan diwakili oleh penasihat hukum yang sama atau terkoordinasi, semua kasus harus diselesaikan dalam arbitrase secara bertahap menggunakan proses bellwether bertahap. Anda setuju untuk melakukannya meskipun penyelesaian beberapa klaim mungkin tertunda. Pada tahap pertama, para pihak harus memilih hingga 10 kasus untuk diajukan ke arbitrase dan diselesaikan oleh arbiter terpisah. Sementara itu, tidak ada kasus lain yang dapat diajukan melalui arbitrase. Penyedia arbitrase juga tidak boleh menerima, mengelola, atau meminta pembayaran untuk biaya arbitrase lainnya. Jika sisa kasus tidak diselesaikan setelah tahap pertama selesai, para pihak akan mengulangi proses tersebut. Prosesi pemimpin bertahap ini akan berlanjut sampai semua kasus diselesaikan. Jika subpasal ini berlaku untuk Pemberitahuan Sengketa, undang-undang pembatasan apa pun yang berlaku untuk klaim yang terdaftar akan dibunyikan sejak kasus pertama dipilih untuk proses penentu sampai Pemberitahuan Sengketa penggugat dipilih untuk dilanjutkan atau diselesaikan. Pengadilan akan memiliki kewenangan untuk memberlakukan subbagian ini, termasuk kewenangan untuk melarang pengajuan atau penuntutan arbitrase atau penetapan biaya terkait.

e) Prosedur Arbitrase. Arbitrase apa pun akan dilakukan oleh JAMS berdasarkan Peraturan dan Prosedur Arbitrase Komprehensif JAMS (“Aturan JAMS”) yang berlaku pada saat Sengketa diajukan. Anda dapat meminta pemeriksaan melalui telepon atau tatap muka dengan mengikuti Aturan JAMS. Dalam perselisihan yang melibatkan $10.000 atau kurang, sidang apa pun akan dilakukan melalui telepon kecuali arbiter menemukan alasan yang baik untuk mengadakan sidang langsung. Sejauh forum yang disediakan oleh JAMS tidak tersedia, WEBTOON dan Anda setuju untuk memilih layanan penyelesaian sengketa alternatif yang disetujui bersama dan bahwa layanan penyelesaian sengketa alternatif tersebut akan menerapkan Aturan JAMS. Arbiter dapat memberikan ganti rugi yang sama kepada Anda secara individu seperti yang dapat dilakukan oleh pengadilan. Arbiter dapat memberikan ganti rugi deklaratif atau ganti rugi hanya kepada Anda secara individu, dan hanya sejauh yang diperlukan untuk memenuhi klaim individu Anda.

f) Biaya Arbitrase. Siapa pun yang mengajukan arbitrase membayar biaya pengarsipan awal. Jika file WEBTOON, maka WEBTOON akan membayar; jika Anda mengajukan, maka Anda akan membayar kecuali Anda mendapatkan keringanan biaya berdasarkan aturan arbitrase yang berlaku. Masing-masing pihak akan menanggung biaya pengacara, ahli, dan saksi pihak tersebut, dan biaya lainnya, terlepas dari pihak mana yang menang, tetapi salah satu pihak dapat memperoleh kembali sebagian atau semua biaya (termasuk biaya pengacara) dari pihak lain jika arbiter, menerapkan hukum yang berlaku, jadi menentukan.

g) Periode Pengajuan. Sejauh diizinkan oleh undang-undang, setiap Perselisihan berdasarkan Perjanjian ini harus diajukan dalam waktu satu (1) tahun dalam proses arbitrase. Jangka waktu satu tahun dimulai pada tanggal paling awal ketika salah satu dari klaim yang dituduhkan pertama kali bertambah, terlepas dari apakah kerusakan tambahan terjadi setelah klaim tersebut pertama kali bertambah. Jika Sengketa tidak diajukan dalam waktu satu tahun, Sengketa tersebut akan dilarang secara permanen.

h) Memilih Keluar. Anda dapat memilih keluar dari arbitrase dalam waktu 30 hari sejak tanggal pertama kali Anda menyetujui Perjanjian (termasuk versi sebelumnya). Jika sebelumnya Anda telah menyetujui arbitrase, maka Anda dapat memilih keluar dari revisi ketentuan arbitrase di masa mendatang dalam waktu 30 hari setelah menerima pemberitahuan tentang ketentuan arbitrase yang diperbarui, dalam hal ini versi arbitrase sebelumnya akan berlaku. Untuk keluar dari arbitrase (atau revisi ketentuan arbitrase ini), Anda harus mengirimkan nama, alamat tempat tinggal, nama pengguna, alamat email, atau nomor telepon yang Anda gunakan untuk akun Layanan Anda, dan pernyataan yang jelas bahwa Anda ingin keluar dari arbitrase ini perjanjian (atau revisinya), dan Anda harus mengirimkannya ke sini: [dl\_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com](mailto:dl_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com).

i) AFILIASI WEBTOON, AGEN, KARYAWAN, DAN SUBKONTRAKTOR DIMAKSUDKAN SEBAGAI PENERIMA PIHAK KETIGA DARI KLAUSUL ARBITRASE DALAM BAGIAN 17.

#### 9\. 廣告及第三方服務

a) WEBTOON可以根據本協議，在線上或線下向您提供自己的廣告或任何第三方的廣告，包括但不限於在WEBTOON網站及/或WEBTOON應用程式上。廣告包括但不限於為宣傳第三方廣告主產品或服務而投放的宣傳訊息（包括任何相關技術）。廣告可能包含腳本、文本、圖形、聲音及/或影片或其任何組合，且可將用戶引導至外部連接（例如，著陸頁面）。

b) 本服務可能包含或接受第三方服務或內容之連結，以及與第三方平台（如社群媒體網站）之整合。WEBTOON並未對該等第三方服務、內容及整合進行控制、背書、贊助、推薦或以其他方式承擔責任。根據使用該等第三方服務的條款條件及隱私權政策，使用任何連結的第三方服務、內容及整合時，須由您自行承擔風險，我們無法控制這些網站或資源的內容，亦不對它們或因您使用它們而可能產生的任何損失或損害承擔任何責任。任何有關該第三方服務或資源或其任何連結的疑慮，皆應直接聯絡特定第三方服務或資源。

#### 10\. 購買與兌換代幣

本服務部分可能包括需要使用代幣進行兌換之內容。您可以透過「購買」及/或「獲得」代幣來存取此類內容。無論您是否「購買」及/或「獲得」代幣，皆不代表您擁有該等代幣。代幣不構成任何法定個人財產權。此外，代幣並不擁有，亦無法兌換任何「真實世界」的幣值。您被授予一有限、不可轉讓、可撤銷、非獨家的許可，可將代幣用於個人用途，但僅限於存取與本服務相關之特定內容。

a) 代幣將透過WEBTOON指定的方式提供給您，例如購買、特別優惠等。有關代幣的付款方式、單位及所有其他條件，相關細節將由WEBTOON決定並顯示於相對應的本服務上。

b) 除了存取本服務所提供的特定內容外，代幣不能交換或用於任何其他目的。WEBTOON保留隨時更改代幣購買價格的權利，WEBTOON可能不時變更存取內容所需的代幣數量，並顯示於相對應的本服務上。您存取及/或兌換代幣時所適用之條款，以您存取及/或使用內容當日有效之條款為準，其將展示於相對應的本服務上。

c) 您帳號所購買的代幣無論何時均不得超過**美金二千（2,000）元**（或等值的當地貨幣）。

d) 除上述第c點限制外，在任何情況下，您任一及所有帳號每日購買的代幣總額不得超過**美金一萬（10,000）元**（或等值的當地貨幣）。

e) 雖然我們並無該等義務，但若我們基於先前的交易活動，懷疑所發起的交易未經授權或有詐欺、可疑或其他異常情況，我們得拒絕此一代幣買賣。

f) 我們可以隨時自行修改或限制您帳號中持有的代幣最高餘額及您可以購買的代幣的最大值。

g) 代幣只能用於購買及/或獲得時使用的帳號上。此外，即使使用同一帳號，代幣無法在不同作業系統的裝置之間移轉，也無法使用於不同語言版本的內容。例如，以iOS系統存取英文內容的帳號購買的代幣，無法使用在以Android系統存取的西班牙語內容上（即便使用同一個帳號）。

h) 您同意WEBTOON出售給您的所有代幣都是不可更改的，除非適用法律要求或我們自行決定取消您購買的代幣，否則不會因任何原因退款。

i) WEBTOON可能不時提供您無需付費取得的 回饋型代幣 促銷代幣，包括您下載及/或購買WEBTOON應用程式或其他產品、使用本服務或任何其他促銷活動時我們提供給您的任何代幣（「 回饋型代幣 」）。 回饋型代幣可能會在WEBTOON不時指定的某段期間後失效。當您使用代幣兌換內容時，您帳號中的任何 回饋型代幣將被優先用來兌換，其次才是您購買的代幣。

j) 您不得在本服務外轉讓代幣（例如出售、贈送或交易），亦不得再授權、交易、出售或嘗試出售代幣以換取真錢，或將代幣換成本服務以外的任何有價物。任何此類轉讓皆為禁止且無效。

k) 若因業務或技術原因中止使用本服務中的代幣，我們將提前一（1）個月通知您。在這種情況下，所有未使用的代幣將在指定的服務中止日起失效。

l) 僅適用於iOS用戶：無需登入帳號也可購買代幣。但若您選擇在未登入帳號下購買及/或使用代幣，購買的代幣和解鎖的集數（「所購項目」）將只會儲存在您的裝置上。這表示您將無法將所購項目移轉至另一台裝置上，且若您從該裝置刪除WEBTOON應用程式，即便重新安裝WEBTOON應用程式，一切所購項目仍將被永久刪除且無法還原。

#### 11\. 費用

您可能需要向WEBTOON支付費用才能購買代幣或以其他方式使用本服務的特定功能（「服務費」）。您有責任在購買時支付本服務所列的任何適用服務費。若該服務費載明將在本服務重複發生，您同意WEBTOON得以您初次購買時指定的付款方式（您的「付款方式」），定期收取該服務費。透過使用付款方式支付服務費，您明確同意WEBTOON有權以付款方式收取服務費及您可能購買的任何額外服務的費用，連同任何適用稅金。您確認並同意本服務任何費用可能隨時增加。本服務可能不時有新功能或附加功能，皆有可能收取額外費用，在這種情況下，WEBTOON將在收取額外費用之前通知您。若WEBTOON收取與本服務相關的額外費用，您將有機會在被收費前查看並接受將收取的額外費用。您確認並同意WEBTOON可以使用第三方支付業者代表我們處理服務費用，且WEBTOON不對該第三方支付業者造成的任何錯誤負責。

#### 12\. 終止及暫停

#### 13\. 免責聲明

使用本服務及/或數位內容的風險由您自行承擔。WEBTOON或WEBTOON任何代表提供之任何口頭或書面資料或建議皆不構成保證，且本服務及/或數位內容皆係按「現況」提供，包含所有錯誤在內，不提供任何類型的保證。WEBTOON及其授權人聲明對所有明示、默示或法定保證不負任何責任，包括但不限於對適銷性、適於特定用途、正確性、平靜享用、品質令人滿意、未侵犯第三方權利之默示保證或條件，以及它們在任何司法管轄區法律下的對應物。WEBTOON不作聲明或保證本服務或您對本服務的存取與使用不會中斷或沒有錯誤，沒有病毒、惡意程式碼或其他有害元件，或是安全的。對於您使用本服務而對您的行動裝置、平板、筆記型電腦或桌上型電腦、電腦系統、其他硬體或軟體造成任何性質的損害，或任何資料遺失或損壞、人身傷害或財產損失，或任何性質的損害，WEBTOON概不負責。WEBTOON對本服務內容或與本網站連結的任何網站內容之正確性或完整性不作任何聲明或保證，且對於任何錯誤或不正確的內容、任何內容的錯誤或遺漏或因使用任何發表的、以電子郵件發送、傳輸或以其他方式透過本服務提供的任何內容造成的任何損失或損害不承擔任何責任或義務。WEBTOON不對第三方透過本服務或任何超連結服務或在任何橫幅或其他廣告中主打或提供的任何產品或服務承擔任何責任，WEBTOON不會成為交易當事人或以任何方式負責監督您與產品或服務的第三方供應商之間的任何交易。如同透過任何媒介或在任何環境中購買產品或服務，您應該在適當的情況下做出最佳判斷並謹慎行事。從WEBTOON或透過本服務獲得的任何建議或資訊皆不構成本段未明確作出之保證或聲明。部分司法管轄區禁止以上排除或聲明限制條款。於該等司法管轄區內，上述聲明限制條款之一部或全部可能不適用於您，於此種情況下，另有其他約定的附錄可能適用於您，且您同意於適用法律所允許的最大範圍內，本協議其餘部分仍為有效且可執行。

#### 14\. 責任限制

在法律未禁止之最大範圍內，對於您任何間接、附帶或結果性損害，或對於違反任何明示或默示擔保、違約、過失、嚴格責任、侵權或任何與WEBTOON網站、WEBTOON應用程式、用戶貼文、數位內容或本服務任何其他元件有關之任何其他法律理論，任何利潤損失、收益損失、資料遺失、使用WEBTOON網站、WEBTOON應用程式、用戶貼文及/或數位內容或任何相關產品，或內容的任何錯誤、誤植或不正確，任何內容中的錯誤或遺漏，或因您使用發表的、以電子郵件發送、傳輸的任何內容或以其他方式透過本服務提供的內容而導致的任何損失或損害，WEBTOON及其授權人及關係企業皆不承擔任何責任，即使WEBTOON已被告知可能有此類損害。使用WEBTOON網站、WEBTOON應用程式、用戶貼文、數位內容及本服務其他元件時，須由您自行承擔風險。

您明確認知WEBTOON不對任何第三方之內容或誹謗、冒犯或非法行為負任何責任，且上述傷害或損害的風險完全由您承擔。

在不影響上述規定下，WEBTOON及其關係企業根據本協議，就根據本協議而產生或與本協議有關的任何請求之整體責任僅限於您在本協議下實際支付之服務費金額。

#### 16\. 準據法；爭議

b) 本協議應依加州法律解釋，不考慮任何選擇或法律衝突之規定或規則。

c) 您同意任何可能由本協議引起或與本協議相關之法律訴訟、訴因或程序，若未按照第17條規定由具有約束力之仲裁解決，僅得向美國聯邦法院或加州法院、在洛杉磯市及洛杉磯郡提起，儘管我們保留在您居住的國家或任何其他相關國家，對您違反本協議提起訴訟或程序之權利。您放棄對由該法院對您行使管轄權及在該法院審理提出任何及一切反對意見。

#### 17\. 仲裁與拋棄團體訴訟權

請仔細閱讀本條，因為它會影響您的權利。同意具約束力的仲裁，即表示您放棄透過法院解決爭議並讓法官或陪審團裁決您案件的權利。

為了迅速完成並控制爭議費用，WEBTOON與您同意，因您使用本服務或本協議而產生或與之相關的任何法律或合理之請求、爭議、訴訟或程序（「爭議」）將在法律允許的範圍內依照下列方式解決：

a) 爭議通知：如果發生爭議，您或WEBTOON必須向另一方提供一份書面聲明，載明提供方的名稱、地址和聯絡資料、引起爭議的事實以及建議的解決方案（「爭議通知」）。 您必須通過掛號信將任何爭議通知發送至 WEBTOON，地址為 WEBTOON at NAVER Green Factory 6-10F, 6, Buljeong-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea Attention: Legal Department，並通過電子郵件發送至 dl\_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com 。如果WEBTOON有任何爭議通知，WEBTOON將以美國第一類郵件寄至您的地址，或傳送至您的電子郵件地址。您和WEBTOON將在爭議通知發出之日起六十（60）天內嘗試透過非正式協商解決任何爭議。六十（60）天後，您或WEBTOON可以開始進行仲裁。仲裁人將裁定任何爭議是否違反本款，並有權禁止提起或執行仲裁。除非適用法律禁止，仲裁人將待符合本款之規定後，執行任何仲裁。

b) 調解、有約束力的仲裁及準據法：您和WEBTOON應努力根據司法仲裁和調解服務公司（「JAMS」）的調解規則透過調解解決任何爭議。調解地點應為加州洛杉磯。在指定調解人後三十（30）天內或您或WEBTOON可能另行同意的時間內未透過本條所指調解解決的任何爭議，應依本第17條所述透過具約束力的仲裁最終解決。您放棄在法官或陪審團面前在法庭上提起訴訟（或作為當事人或團體成員參與）所有爭議的權利。相反地，所有爭議都將在中立的仲裁人面前解決，除《聯邦仲裁法》規定的有限上訴權外，該仲裁人的決定將具終局性。仲裁人應決定與仲裁容許性有關的所有問題，包括他或她自己的管轄權有效性和協議的可執行性（例如，顯失公平原則）。為免生疑慮，這並不表示削減根據適用的JAMS規則授予仲裁人的任何權力。仲裁地點應為加州洛杉磯。任何對當事人有管轄權的法院都可以執行仲裁人的裁決。

c) 團體訴訟豁免：在任何法院為解決任何爭議或提起的任何爭議訴訟程序，將僅以個人身分進行。您和WEBTOON均不會尋求將任何爭議以團體訴訟或任何一方以代表身份行事或擬以代表身份行事的任何其他程序進行審理。未經所有受影響的仲裁或程序之所有當事人事先書面同意，不得將仲裁或程序與其他仲裁或程序合併。不允許團體訴訟和團體仲裁；例如，您只能代表您自己提出請求，不能尋求會影響其他本服務用戶的救濟。除非全體當事人同意，否則仲裁人也不得合併仲裁。如果最終司法裁定本款的限制對於特定請求或特定救濟請求（例如，禁制令請求）不可執行，則全體當事人同意該請求或救濟請求應在所有其他請求和救濟請求經仲裁後由法院裁定。

d) 大規模仲裁：如果25名或更多原告提交類似的爭議通知或提起類似的仲裁，並由同一名或同等的律師代理，則所有案件都必須使用分階段的前導程序分階段仲裁解決。即使某些請求的裁決可能會拖延，您仍同意這麼做。在第一階段，全體當事人應選擇最多10個案件提交仲裁，並由不同的仲裁人裁決。在此期間，其他案件不得提交仲裁。仲裁者也不得接受、管理或要求支付其他仲裁的費用。如果，其他案件在第一階段完成後仍未解決，全體當事人將重複這個程序。這些分階段的前導訴訟將繼續進行，直到所有案件都得到解決。如果將本款應用於爭議通知，則適用於所列請求的任何法定時效將從第一批案件被選入前導訴訟程序之時起算，直至原告的爭議通知被選為前導程序或以其他方式解決。法院將有權執行本款，包括禁止提起或執行仲裁或評估相關費用的權力。

e) 仲裁程序：任何仲裁都將由JAMS根據提出爭議時的有效JAMS綜合仲裁規則和程序（「JAMS規則」）進行。您可以按照JAMS規則要求電話或現場聽證會。在涉及一萬（10,000）美元或以下的爭議中，任何聽證會都將以電話形式進行，除非仲裁人找到適當的理由改為舉行現場聽證會。在JAMS提供的法院不可用時，WEBTOON和您同意選擇雙方同意的替代性爭議解決服務，且該替代性爭議解決服務應適用JAMS規則。仲裁人可能會像法院一樣判給您個人相同的損害賠償金。仲裁人可以僅判給您個人確認性或禁令性救濟，但僅在滿足您的個人請求範圍內。

f) 仲裁費：提起仲裁的人支付最初的申請費。如果WEBTOON提起，則WEBTOON會付費；如果您提起，那麼您將支付費用，除非您根據適用的仲裁規則獲得費用減免。無論哪一方勝訴，每個當事人將負擔該方的律師、專家和證人的費用和其他費用，但如果仲裁人引用適用法律而裁定，一方當事人可從另一方獲得任何或所有費用（包括律師費）。

g) 申請期限：在法律允許的範圍內，本協議的任何爭議必須在一（1）年內提出仲裁程序。一年期限從任何所主張的請求首次產生的最早日期開始，無論在該請求首次產生之後是否發生額外損害。如果爭議未在一年內提出，則永久禁止提出。

h) 退出：您可以在您首次同意本協議（包括任何較早版本）之日起三十（30）天內退出仲裁。若您先前已同意仲裁，則您可以在收到仲裁條款更新的通知後三十（30）天內退出仲裁條款的任何未來修訂，在這種情況下，將適用先前版本的仲裁。要退出仲裁（或對本仲裁條款的修訂），您必須發送您用於服務帳號的姓名、居住地址、用戶名稱、電子郵件地址或電話號碼，以及您想要退出此仲裁協議（或其修訂）的明確聲明，您必須將它們發送到這裡： [dl\_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com](mailto:dl_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com)。

i) WEBTOON關係企業、代理人、員工及分包商皆為本第17條仲裁條款之第三方受益人。

#### 18\. 完整協議與可分離性

本協議為您與WEBTOON之間關於本服務及/或數位內容之完整協議，並取代先前就該相關事宜所作之理解。若本協議任何條款或條件被視為無效或因任何原因無法執行，該部分將被視為可分離且不會影響任何其餘條款或條件之有效性及可執行性。
