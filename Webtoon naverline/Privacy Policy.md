Depending on where you reside, and subject to applicable law and exceptions, you may be entitled to the following rights with respect to your personal information:  
  
\- **Right to Know**: Subject to applicable exceptions, you may have the right to request that we disclose personal information that we have collected, sold, or shared about you in the past 12 months, including:

\- **Other California Rights**:  
o **Shine the Light**: California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. o **Do Not Track**: Some web browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.  
To submit an access, deletion, correction, or portability request, [click here](https://www.webtoons.com/en/terms/dnsmpi) or contact us as specified in the [Contact Us](#pp_10_en) section of this Privacy Policy. We may require that you provide us with your e-mail address. When we receive your request, we will review the information that you provide and attempt to use it to verify your identity by comparing it against the information we have on file. You may also have an authorized agent submit a request on your behalf through this process. When we receive such a request, we will process the request, consistent with our standard process for verifying consumer requests. In addition, we may request information to demonstrate the agent’s authority to act on your behalf. You may have the right to appeal a denial of your consumer rights request by [Customer Care](https://webtoon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or email contact ([dpo@webtoonscorp.com](mailto:dpo@webtoonscorp.com)).  
  
As noted above, we do not engage in profiling to make decisions that result in a legal or similarly significant effect based solely on automated processing of your personal information. All decision-making processes related to the processing purposes described above are carried out with human intervention.  
  
Although some of the information that we may collect could be considered sensitive information under certain U.S. state privacy laws, we only use and disclose sensitive information for a subset of the purposes described above. For example, we may collect and process SSNs and information of citizenship for tax purposes.  
  
You may access or correct your personal information registered with us at any time via the “Account” or “Creator Profile” page.  
  
You may ask us to delete your personal information by deleting your account at any time. If you have any series published on CANVAS, you must delete them first to delete your account. Once you delete your account, your account profile and subscription history will be deleted permanently and become unrecoverable. Any tax information submitted to us will be maintained for a period of time, as required by financial laws and regulations.  
  
If you would like to change your preference regarding our communications (including marketing communications), you can change your communication preferences from “Account” page or “Settings” page. You can also unsubscribe from our email marketing communications at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link on the bottom of the email.  
  
If you do not want us to use your personal information such as account information and inferences about you based on your activity to show you personalized ads on WEBTOON, you can turn off personalized ads in Ads Settings.  
  
You can manage the use of optional cookies by clicking on the “Cookie Settings” solution displayed when you open the application/visit the website and at any time through the Cookie Settings. To find out more on how we use the cookies collected, please refer to our Cookie Policy. You can also restrict or disable certain types of cookies by visiting [https://www.allaboutcookies.org/](https://allaboutcookies.org/) or [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).  
  
**C. Data Retention**  
  
We take appropriate steps to ensure that we process and retain information about you based on the following logic:  
\- at the minimum duration for which the information is used to provide you with a service;  
\- as required under law, a contract, or with regard to our statutory obligations (e.g., tax laws); or  
\- only for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, is processed, or longer if required under any contract, by applicable law, or, in anonymized form, for statistical purposes, subject to appropriate safeguards.  
  
Thus, we will only keep your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collect them and to comply with legal, financial, business or reporting requirements. When we no longer need the personal information, we will securely delete or destroy it.  
We will store the collected data even thereafter, until the expiration of any legal liability arising therefrom.

#### 5\. Conservation des données à caractère personnel

Nous prenons des mesures appropriées pour garantir que nous traitons et conservons les données vous concernant selon la logique suivante :

\- en application des lois, d’un contrat ou en lien avec nos obligations légales (par exemple en matière fiscale) ; ou

Nous ne conservons donc vos données à caractère personnel qu’aussi longtemps que nous en avons besoin pour les finalités pour lesquelles nous les collectons et pour nous conformer à des exigences juridiques, financières, commerciales ou de déclaratives. Lorsque nous n’avons plus besoin des données à caractère personnel, nous les supprimons ou détruisons de manière sécurisée. Une fois ces finalités réalisées, vos données à caractère personnel seront supprimées ou détruites de manière sécurisée.  
  
Nous continuons néanmoins à stocker les données collectées après cette date jusqu’à l’expiration de toute obligation juridique en découlant.

Si le consentement parental des parents ou responsables légaux de l’utilisateur est requis, nous obtenons ce consentement avant de traiter les données à caractère personnel de mineurs.  
  
**Vos droits**
