15. **GOVERNING LAW.** The DAA Solution is controlled and operated by DAA from its offices within the United States. This TOU has been made in and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the State of New York. Any action to enforce this TOU will be brought in the courts presiding in the State of New York, and all parties to this TOU expressly agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of such courts. A printed version of this TOU and of any related notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this TOU or the DAA Solution, to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The DAA Solution is controlled and operated by DAA from its offices and facilities within the United States. DAA makes no representation that the DAA Solution is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to the DAA Solution from territories or nations where any aspect of the DAA Solution is illegal is hereby expressly prohibited.

16. **TERM AND TERMINATION.** This TOU will take effect (or shall re-take effect) at the time you submit information through the DAA Solution, respond to a request for information, and/or begin accessing, or using the DAA Solution, whichever is earliest. DAA reserves the right at any time and without notice to deny you access to the DAA Solution or to any portion thereof and to terminate your rights under this TOU, in its sole and absolute discretion for any reason whatsoever.

17. **WAIVER & SEVERABILITY.** Failure to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. No waiver by DAA of any right under this TOU will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time. If any part of this TOU is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers, venue, claim, and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this TOU shall continue in effect.
18. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and DAA as a result of this TOU or your utilization of the DAA Solution. This TOU represents the entire agreement between you and DAA with respect to your individual use of the DAA Solution. **Please note that DAA reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this TOU and the terms and conditions under which the DAA Solution and its offerings are extended to you by posting online a revised TOU or mailing and/or emailing notice thereof to you. In addition, DAA may add, modify, or delete any aspect, program, functionality, or feature of the DAA Solution. Your continued use of the DAA Solution following any addition, modification, or deletion will be conclusively deemed acceptance of any change to the terms and conditions of this TOU. Accordingly, please review this TOU found at this location on a periodic basis.**
