personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a

royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your

analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect on the Site (the “Analytical Data”).

advertising; (5) to keep track of promotions and advertising; (6) to improve navigation and areas of the

Site; (7) to promote trust and safety on the Site; or (8) to provide features and services that are available

only through the use of cookies. From time to time, some business partners and advertisers may use

cookies on the Site. We do not have access to or control over information collected by use of these

cookies.

about your online activities over time and across different websites or authorize third parties to do so.

7. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS



Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from

companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which Aimtell has disclosed

personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes and a disclosure of the

shared information. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that

provides you with an “opt-out” choice for use of your personal information by third parties for direct

marketing purposes, Aimtell may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your

disclosure choice options.



The Site qualifies for the alternative option. This Policy provides you with information on how you may

opt-out from the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.

Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your

personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party

disclosure choices, please send a request to the following e-mail address: support@aimtell.com Please
