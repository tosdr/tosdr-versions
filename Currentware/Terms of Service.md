Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) was rightfully known to the Receiving Party without restriction on use or disclosure prior to such information being disclosed or made available to the Receiving Party in connection with this Agreement; (b) was or becomes generally known by the public other than by the Receiving Party’s or any of its Representatives’ non-compliance with this Agreement; (c) was or is received by the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party that was not or is not, at the time of such receipt, under any obligation to maintain its confidentiality; or (d) the Receiving Party can demonstrate by written or other documentary records was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of any Confidential Information.

9.3 Protection of Confidentiality Information. As a condition to being provided with any disclosure of or access to Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall:

(a) not access or use Confidential Information other than as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement;

(b) except as may be permitted by and subject to its compliance with 9.4, not disclose or permit access to Confidential Information other than to its Representatives who: (i) need to know such Confidential Information for purposes of the Receiving Party’s exercise of its rights or performance of its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the Receiving Party’s obligations under this 9.3; and (iii) are bound by confidentiality and restricted use obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms set forth in this 9.3;

(c) safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure using at least the degree of care it uses to protect its similarly sensitive information and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care;

(d) ensure its Representatives’ compliance with, and be responsible and liable for any of its Representatives’ non-compliance with, the terms of this 9; and

(e) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and use its best efforts to prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure.

9.4 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party’s obligations under this 9 with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under any applicable Law will continue until such time, if ever, as such Confidential Information ceases to qualify for trade secret protection under one or more such applicable Laws other than as a result of any act or omission of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives.

9.5 Compelled Disclosures. If the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is compelled by applicable Law to disclose any Confidential Information then, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Receiving Party shall: (a) promptly, and prior to such disclosure, notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party can seek a protective order or other remedy or waive its rights under 9.3; and (b) provide reasonable assistance to the Disclosing Party in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure. If the Disclosing Party waives compliance or, after providing the notice and assistance required under this 9.5, the Receiving Party remains required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that, on the advice of the Receiving Party’s legal counsel, the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, on the Disclosing Party’s request, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from the applicable court or other authority having jurisdiction that such Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.

10\. **Payment**. All Licence Fees and Support Fees are payable in advance in the manner set forth in the Order Form and are non-refundable. Any renewal of the licence or maintenance and support services hereunder shall not be effective until the fees for such renewal have been paid in full.

11\. **Term and Termination**.

11.1 Term. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 11.2 below, this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in force for the Initial Term. Thereafter, the term of the Agreement will be automatically renewed on the anniversary of the Effective Date for additional renewal terms equal to the duration of the Initial Term specified in the Order Form (any such subsequent renewal terms referred to in this Agreement as a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term hereof. CurrentWare reserves the right to change fees for the CurrentWare Service upon thirty (30) days of written notice before each Renewal Term. Collectively, the Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Terms shall constitute the “Term”.

11.2 Suspension of Service. CurrentWare may suspend Business’s access to the CurrentWare Service if: (i) Business’s account is overdue or (ii) Business has exceeded its Scope of Use limits. CurrentWare may also suspend Business’s access to the CurrentWare Service, remove Business Data or disable third-party products if it determines that: (a) Business has breached the provision of the Agreement or (b) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other Businesss or third parties, including any third-party payment processor, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the CurrentWare Service. CurrentWare will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For avoidance of doubt, Business will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period. However, unless this Agreement has been terminated, CurrentWare will cooperate with Business to restore access to the Service once it verifies that Business has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

11.3 Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party: (i) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (ii) ceases operation without a successor; or (iii) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). If Business terminates during the Agreement for any reason other than the foregoing, Business will be responsible for the fees due for the then current Term. CurrentWare may also terminate this Agreement immediately if Business breaches Sections 2, 3 or 5, for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.

11.4 Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i) Business’s license rights shall terminate and it must immediately cease use of the CurrentWare Service and delete (or, at CurrentWare’s request, return) any and all copies of any CurrentWare documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes and any other CurrentWare Confidential Information in Business’s possession, custody or control and (ii) Business’s right to access any Business Data in the applicable Service will cease and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, CurrentWare may delete any such data in its possession at any time. If CurrentWare terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 11.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Business. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

11.5 Licensor may terminate this Agreement, effective upon written notice to Licensee, if Licensee, breaches this Agreement and such breach: (i) is incapable of cure; or (ii) being capable of cure, remains uncured thirty (30) days after Licensor provides written notice thereof.

11.6 Licensor may terminate this Agreement, effective immediately, if Licensee files an assignment in bankruptcy or has a bankruptcy order made against it under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or applies for, or consents to, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, receiver-manager, monitor, or custodian for all or a substantial part of its property.

11.7 Upon expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, the licence granted hereunder shall also terminate, and Licensee shall cease using and destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation, and permanently erase or cause to be erased from its and its Authorized Users’ computer systems, files, and storage media all copies of the Software and Documentation of Licensor obtained, made, or authorized to be made by Licensee or on Licensee’s behalf. No expiration or termination shall affect Licensee’s obligation to pay all Licensee Fees and Support Fees that may have become due before such expiration or termination, or entitle Licensee to any refund.

11.8 The provisions set forth in the following sections, and any other right or obligation of the parties in this Agreement that, by its nature, should survive termination or expiration of this Agreement, will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1, 7.2, 8, 9, 11.7, 11.8, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
