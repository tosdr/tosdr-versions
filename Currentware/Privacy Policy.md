**Last modified:** 11 December 2024

INTRODUCTION
------------

CURRENTWARE INC. (“Company” or “We”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it by complying with this policy.

This policy describes:

* How we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information of our customers and website users (“you”).
* Describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website https://www.currentware.com/ (our “Website”).
* Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

Privacy laws in Canada generally define “personal information” as any information about an identifiable individual, which includes information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person. 

This policy applies to information we collect, use, or disclose about you:

The Website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, services, social networks, or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share data about you. If you follow a link to a third-party website or engage a third-party plugin, please note that these third parties have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. We do not control these third-party websites, and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

This policy DOES NOT apply to information that:

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
---------------------------

We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:

* To present our Website and its contents to you.
* To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.
* To fulfill the purposes for which you provided the information or that were described when it was collected, or any other purpose for which you provide it.
* To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts with you, including for billing and collection or to comply with legal requirements.
* To notify you about changes to our Website or any products or services we offer or provide though it.

We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to our advertisers’ target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your personal information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.

DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
------------------------------

We may disclose aggregated information about our users as permitted by law.

We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:

* To our subsidiaries and affiliates.
* In accordance with applicable law, to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by the Company about our customers and users is among the assets transferred.
* To advertisers and advertising networks that require the information to select and serve relevant advertisements to you and others.
* To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business (such as analytics and search engine providers that assist us with Website improvement and optimization) and who are contractually obligated to keep personal information confidential, use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them, and to process the personal information with the same standards set out in this policy.
* To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. 
* For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
* With your consent.

We may also disclose your personal information:

* To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request, in accordance with applicable law.
* To enforce or apply our terms of use \[LINK TO WEBSITE’S TERMS OF USE\] and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
* If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our customers, or others. 

CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION
------------------------------------------------------

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

Targeted Advertising. You can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting: 

* FACEBOOK – [https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads)
* GOOGLE – [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous/](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous%5C)
* BING – [https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads](https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads)
* Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal at:  [http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/).

Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.

DATA SECURITY
-------------

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We use physical, electronic, and administrative measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. 

DATA RETENTION
--------------

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Under some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent. 

ACCESSING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------

By law you have the right to request access to and to correct the personal information that we hold about you.

Applicable law may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some or all of the personal information that we hold about you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal information anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices.

We will provide access to your personal information, subject to exceptions set out in applicable privacy legislation. 

If you are concerned about our response or would like to correct the information provided, you may contact us at info@currentware.com.

WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT
------------------------

Where you have provided your consent to the collection, use, and transfer of your personal information, you may have the legal right to withdraw your consent under certain circumstances. To withdraw your consent, if applicable, contact us at [info@currentware.com](mailto:info@currentware.com) Please note that if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service. We will explain the impact to you at the time to help you with your decision. 

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
-----------------------------

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you through a notice on the Website home page.
