Welcome to ReceiptJar! ReceiptJar allows you to turn your purchase receipts into points or other rewards that can be converted into cash or other benefits.

ReceiptJar is a service provided by The U Group & Co Limited (ABN 68 610 817 831) (referred to herein as “**ReceiptJar**,” “**we**” or “**us**” or “**our**'').These terms and conditions (“**Terms**”) govern your use of the ReceiptJar service, including ReceiptJar’s website and ReceiptJar’s mobile application (the “**App**”). You must accept these Terms before using, accessing, or interacting with the App and ReceiptJar’s [Shopper Receipt Panel Program](https://help.receiptjar.com/hc/articles/9184362382991) (the “**Service**”). 

#### **General Acceptance of the Terms**

By downloading or installing the App, using the Service, or submitting a membership application to ReceiptJar, you indicate that you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms as well to comply with any other terms, conditions, notices and disclaimers contained elsewhere on the App, Service or on our website. In some instances, additional or different terms posted on the Service apply to your use of certain parts of the Service (“**Additional Terms**”). To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, these Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise. You further consent to our privacy practices as described in our Privacy Policy at https://www.receiptjar.com/privacy-policy. If you do not agree with these Terms and any Additional Terms, you must not download or install the App or otherwise access or use the Service.

If you are using the Service from the United States: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY WAIVER THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. THE ARBITRATION PROVISION REQUIRES THAT ALL DISPUTES BE RESOLVED IN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT PROCEEDINGS. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN A COURT PROCEEDING.

#### **Changes to the Terms**

Subject to any notice obligations under applicable law, we reserve the right to revise these Terms at any time upon provision of no less than 30 days’ notice to you by posting changes on the ReceiptJar website at https://receiptjar.com or by updating the App to incorporate the new Terms.  All revisions are effective immediately when we post them.

We recommend that you check these Terms periodically so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. If you do not agree to these Terms or any changes to them, you should immediately cease using the Service and uninstall App downloads and applications. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.

#### **Changes to the Service**

We may vary any aspect of the Service at our discretion. We reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate the Service and/or these Terms at any time upon notice to you.

#### **Content of the App**

While we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of information or content provided on the App, we make no express or implied representation or warranty that information or materials contained on the App are complete, accurate, up-to-date, or fit for a particular purpose. To the extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any errors or omissions in such information or materials.

#### **Terms of the Service**

**Account Registration**

In order to use certain parts of the Service, including the App, you must create an account and register with us (“**Account**”).

Accounts may only be set up by an authorized representative of the individual who is the subject of the Account. You may not join or use the Service on behalf of any third party, and you may not allow any third party to use the Service on your behalf. Use of the Service is strictly limited to users who are 18 years of age or over. If you are under 18, you are not permitted to use the App, register as a user of the App, or send personal information to us. We do not review Accounts for authenticity and are not responsible for any unauthorized Accounts. For any dispute as to Account creation or authenticity, we shall have the sole right, but are not obligated, to resolve such dispute as we determine appropriate without notice.

You must provide a valid email address (“**Registered Email Address**”) when you register to use the Service and create an Account. The Registered Email Address you provide when you register for your Account must be an active email address in regular use by you.

We may immediately suspend or terminate your registration or your access to the Service (permanently or temporarily) if you breach any of these Terms, for any reason, or for no reason. We may also impose restrictions on the length and manner of usage of any part of the Service for any reason whatsoever. If restrictions are imposed on you personally, you must not attempt to use the App under any other name or user or on any other mobile device.

You are solely responsible and liable for the security and confidentiality of your access credentials and for restricting access to your device(s) and for all activity under your Account. You must keep your Account password confidential at all times. You are responsible for all transactions made on the ReceiptJar App using your Account or otherwise on your Account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising out of the unauthorised use of your Account.

We will maintain in your Account a balance of points or rewards accumulated through your use of the Service.

You may only maintain one ReceiptJar Account at a time. If you attempt to open multiple Accounts, we may at any time block all of your Accounts and cancel all of your points and redemption requests.

ReceiptJar is currently only available in Australia, Canada and the United States. We do not accept receipts outside of these countries.

**Rewards and Redemptions**

We process your rewards and redemptions as follows:

* When you make a redemption request within the App, you may be asked to confirm your profile information and have a minimum of 1000 points from uploading receipts. If you are unable to confirm your profile information, your redemption may be rejected, and your reward points will be removed from your Account.
    
* ReceiptJar points and shakes will be rewarded as described within the App.
    
* To be eligible for and to request a redemption: 
    

* the total rewards accrued and remaining in your Account must be at least $5 or 1000 points.
    
* your Account must have a completed and up to date profile survey.
    
* your Account must have a valid email address connected with your App password for automation of rewards email receipts.
    

* This is currently only applicable to selected users of our Apps. We reserve the right to change this requirement at any time.
    

* Unless the law in your relevant jurisdiction provides otherwise, points will expire after thirty (30) days of Account inactivity. "**Inactive Accounts**" are those accounts that have not submitted a valid offline receipt within thirty (30) days. Inactive Accounts will not qualify for redemptions.
    
* Subject to our obligation under applicable law, we reserve the right to change the ‘Points System’ and ‘Redemption Options’ at any time and will notify you of changes from within the App by providing at least thirty (30) days’ notice to you.
    
* We endeavor to process redemptions, rewards, and points as soon as possible and within thirty (30) days of submission; however, processing of such redemptions, rewards, and points may take up to 180 days.
    
* You acknowledge that your eligibility to redeem your points for a cash transfer or gift card is conditional upon your ongoing compliance with these Terms. If at any time we have reason to believe that you are not in compliance with these Terms, we may, at any time and in our absolute discretion, do any (or all) of the following:
    

* cancel your membership in the Service;
    
* cancel any right or interest that you may have in points accrued in your Account; or
    
* cancel any outstanding redemption or payment of a cash transfer or gift card.
    

* Points and rewards are not under any circumstances transferable between Service members or Accounts.
    

**Quality of Receipt Images**

* **“Qualifying Transactions”** are images of receipts uploaded through the App that are legible and must include:
    

* the retailer’s name;
    
* all items purchased;
    
* the prices of those items purchased;
    
* the total amount paid in the transaction; and
    
* the transaction date and time.
    

* If any of the above-mentioned information is missing, the receipt will not be eligible to earn rewards (including points).
    
* You will not be eligible to earn rewards (including points) in respect of a receipt unless that receipt is uploaded to the App within seven (7) days of the transaction date of the receipt.
    
* You can only upload up to three (3) receipts per retailer, per transaction date. Any additional receipts in excess of the first three (3) receipts uploaded will not be eligible to earn rewards (including points).
    
* You may only upload accurate and unaltered receipts. Receipts which have already been uploaded or have been modified or obtained from people outside of your household will not be eligible to earn rewards (including points).
    

**Levels**

The App provides thirty (30) user levels. Each level is higher than the last. Your user level will depend on the extent to which you use the App to upload receipts. You will initially be granted Level 1.

Users who use the App regularly to upload receipts will be entitled to have their user level upgraded. The amount of receipts and the use of the App that entitles users to receive an upgrade will be determined from time to time by ReceiptJar in its sole and absolute discretion. 

**Receipt Ownership**

You may only submit your own receipts or receipts from your household shopping trips, which includes your spouse and children under 18 (“**Household**”). Do not submit receipts that have been changed, modified or received by third parties. Receipts that are not eligible for rewards may include (but are not limited to):

* receipts obtained from friends, roommates or colleagues;
    
* receipts obtained from customers;
    
* receipts obtained for commercial or work-related purposes;
    
* receipts obtained from strangers, including receipts collected from the bin or trash; or
    
* receipts obtained from non-Household members.
    

**Suspension/Termination of Account**

* We, in our absolute discretion, reserve the right to decide who may use the App.
    
* We, in our absolute discretion, reserve the right to terminate your account after 30 days of not submitting a valid offline receipt.
    
* We may at any time and in our absolute discretion freeze or block your Account.
    
* We may at any time and in our absolute discretion suspend your Account, or freeze or cancel point accruals or redemptions, if fraudulent activity is detected or suspected. 
    
* We may at any time and in our absolute discretion suspend your Account, or freeze or cancel point accruals or redemptions, if “**Fraudulent Activity**” and/or “**Inappropriate Activity**” is detected or suspected.

Any inappropriate activity, as described under the “**Communications**” and “**Images**” sections below, will result in immediate suspension or termination of your Account, reward points, and any pending redemptions or awards. 

**Communications**

Your communications with us must not constitute offensive behaviour, including (but not limited to) threatening, derogatory, abusive or defamatory statements, or racist, sexually explicit, pornographic, obscene or offensive language.

You must not upload, share, or distribute any images that contain obscene, offensive, or inappropriate behaviour. This includes, but is not limited to, any images that:

* Contain explicit sexual content or nudity.
    
* Depict violence, gore, or graphic content intended to shock or disturb.

* Are intended to harass, intimidate, or threaten others.

We reserve the right to determine, at our absolute discretion, what constitutes obscene or offensive imagery and to take appropriate action.

#### **Shakes & Promotions**

Any bonus reward points received as part of a sign-up promotion, refer a friend, shakes or other bonus promotions may be subject to additional terms and conditions as set out in the App or as notified to you from time to time.     

#### **Auto Sync Connect Features**

We may offer you the opportunity to auto sync your online shopping receipts with your registered App Account (“**Auto Sync**”). Auto Sync securely connects your ReceiptJar Account with your online accounts with various service providers and vendors, such as Gmail, Amazon and Walmart (each, a “**Linked Account**”), allowing you to seamlessly and automatically accrue points from your online receipts through our [Email Connect](https://help.receiptjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/5300612014991-How-to-upload-online-receipts-with-ReceiptJar-Email-Connect) and [App Connect](https://help.receiptjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/4424148466063-Sync-online-accounts-and-e-receipts) features.

Auto Sync uses encrypted Linked Account credentials, not your Linked Account passwords, to connect your Linked Accounts to your ReceiptJar Account. Auto Sync encryption ensures the security and privacy of your Linked Accounts.

To use Auto Sync, you must log into the Linked Account and provide the App with access to the Linked Account. That access can be provided through your Linked Account created App password or via permissions, depending on the Linked Account. The App does not have access to your Linked Account password, and the App will only access information contained in the purchase receipts and invoices from shopping merchants that ReceiptJar has pre-approved for Auto Sync. 

It is important to note that to be eligible for and to redeem points you may be required to connect your email address with the App through the Email Connect feature. This is currently only applicable to selected users of our Apps. We reserve the right to change this requirement at any time.

You may discontinue your participation in Auto Sync at any time. For instructions on how to disconnect from Auto Sync, and to receive support regarding Auto Sync, please reach out to us at [https://help.receiptjar.com/](about:blank) or email us on [hello@receiptjar.com](about:blank).

_Counter-Notification._ If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to ReceiptJar is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.

#### **United States Arbitration and Dispute Terms**

This Section applies to Service users in the United States.

**Forum Selection/Jurisdiction**

Jurisdiction and venue for any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of or relating to the Service, the Content, your UGC, these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, (collectively, “**Dispute**”) shall be in Los Angeles, California. Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Los Angeles, California for any and all purposes.

**Pre-Arbitration Notification**

ReceiptJar and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated; provided, however, that ReceiptJar need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned (“**IP Disputes**,” with all other disputes referred to as “**General Disputes**”). The party making a claim – whether you or ReceiptJar – shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If ReceiptJar is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in your ReceiptJar account, if applicable. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under this Arbitration and Dispute Terms Section. If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to 152 St Georges Terrace, Perth WA 6000, Australia (Attn: General Counsel). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Arbitration and Dispute Terms Section. Either you or ReceiptJar, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief) before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.

**Arbitration of Claims**

Unless you give us notice of opt-out within five (5) business days of your first use of the Service, addressed to: The U Group & Co Limited, ℅ Wework, 152 St Georges Terrace, Perth WA 6000, Australia, all actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to any Dispute, or the scope of the provisions of this Section, shall be submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for final and binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less, to be held in Los Angeles County, California, before a single arbitrator in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1280 et seq. If the matter in dispute is between ReceiptJar and a consumer, the matter shall be submitted to JAMS in accordance with its Policy on Consumer Arbitration Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then by striking from a list of arbitrators supplied by JAMS. We may have the right to pay the JAMS fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable. If you are a consumer, you have the right to an in-person hearing. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates’ lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers. The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The parties may engage in the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California or, if sought by ReceiptJar, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.

**Limitation Injunctive Relief**

AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE DEEMED IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, UGC, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED, OR CONTROLLED BY ANY RECEIPTJAR PARTY (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED UGC) OR A LICENSOR OF ANY RECEIPTJAR PARTY.

**Governing Law**

These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, General Disputes and IP Disputes, and any other claim brought by you against ReceiptJar or by ReceiptJar against you pursuant to this Section, or otherwise related to the Service, the Content, ReceiptJar Licensed Elements, UGC or other ReceiptJar products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. This Arbitration and Dispute Terms Section can only be amended by mutual agreement. Either party may seek enforcement of this Arbitration and Dispute Terms Section in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.

**Class Action Waiver**

As permitted by applicable law, both you and ReceiptJar waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Arbitration and Dispute Terms Section is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.

**Jury Waiver**

AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.

**Small Claims Matters**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of General Dispute (but not IP Disputes) in small claims court.

The provisions of this Section shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties. This Section shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.
