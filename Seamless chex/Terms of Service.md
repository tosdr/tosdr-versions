(a) Personal Use versus Business Use: If you are an individual accessing and/or using the Services to make purchases at or from a business, you may only access and/or use the Services for your own personal, non-commercial use and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any other individual, entity, or third party. If you are an entity registered to do business with the appropriate government agency in the state of registration, you may access and/or use the Services for commercial use.  
  
(b) Authorization: By acknowledging and agreeing to the Agreement, you voluntarily, knowingly, and unconditionally authorize SeamlessChex to: electronically debit your account at your designated financial institution (your “Bank Account”) via ACH for each Transaction and direct your financial institution to respond to inquiries regarding your Bank Account. In addition to your account information, we may request additional information from you and/or your financial institution to process your Transaction, including, but not limited to, information about your Bank Account, information about your address, and/or other information necessary to initiate and/or complete the Transaction. You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use the payment method(s) represented by any such Transaction Information. You agree that you are responsible for paying all amounts charged or incurred for each and every Transaction, including, but not limited to, any applicable sales and use taxes, as well as  any applicable shipping and handling fees that may apply to your purchase.  
  
(c) Returns and Maintaining Sufficient Funds: When accessing and/or using the Services, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that it may take more than sixty (60) days for SeamlessChex to receive notice of the return or reversal of an ACH debit and/or to exercise any right granted or reserved to SeamlessChex under the Agreement.

(d) Declined Payments & Collections: During your access and/or use of Services, you may encounter a declined payment.

If your payment is declined for any reason, you will be notified via email, text message, and/or phone call; and, provided SeamlessChex has not identified that you have engaged in prohibited conduct, SeamlessChex will (i) disable your account and (ii) attempt to process the Transaction again (a “Retry”) using any and all payment options that have been connected to your SeamlessChex account.

The verification process may include sending you texts, voice calls, and/or security questions to answer. By providing us your mobile phone number, you are affirmatively opting in and agreeing that we may send such communications to you at that number, including via an automatic telephone dialing system, during the verification process and at any and all other times thereafter. You agree that as part of the verification process we may: (i) verify Bank Account information by crediting amounts between $0.01 and $1.00 to your Bank Account and then debiting equal amounts and requesting you to verify the amounts credited; and/or (ii) verify your Bank Account information by using your login credentials to your financial institution. We use these verification processes, for among other potential purposes, to validate your account and to screen for fraud. Outside of subsection (e)(i) above, we will not debit your Bank Account, except for to the extent such debit is related to a Transaction. You hereby grant us a limited power of attorney to initiate the actions in this section as part of the bank verification process and you agree that standard data and/or messaging rates (and any increases thereto) will apply when you use the Services on your cellular device, or otherwise.   
  
(f) Transaction Limits: We may: (i) establish security or other limits on Transactions, such as a maximum number of Transactions and/or a maximum dollar amount per Transaction, (ii) change  security limits from time to time without disclosing such changes to you in advance, and/or (iii) refuse to process your Transactions for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe your Bank Account balance is insufficient to cover the amounts due.

That amount is also due immediately. You are responsible and liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, that SeamlessChex may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances from you. You also agree that you will be billed for and will pay any outstanding balances if you cancel any Service. You should let SeamlessChex know about any billing problems or discrepancies within thirty (30) days after they first appear on your account statement. If you do not bring them to SeamlessChex’s attention within thirty (30) days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies. (i) All sales are final and credits are only allowed in limited circumstances, as explained in this section.  SeamlessChex may provide the option to request a credit. Credits may be applied toward the purchase of eligible ancillary purchases during the timeframe specified by the SeamlessChex. The SeamlessChex will determine which ancillary purchases are eligible, as well as the amount of the credit (including any potential promotional amount). Credits are non-transferable, may not be sold, are not redeemable for cash, and may not be combined with other promotions.   (ii)  Chargebacks and Other Refund Prohibitions. You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any prohibitions in any manner with regard to your purchase. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you will not dispute or otherwise seek a “chargeback” from the SeamlessChex whose credit card or other method of payment you used to purchase. Should you do so, you are subject to immediate cancelation, and we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit future purchases from all persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist, and from any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from using the SeamlessChex Web Site.  
  
**Article 7: Registration**  
In order for you to participate in the Service, SeamlessChex will require that you provide specific information about yourself and/or your business. If you choose to participate, you agree to provide true, accurate and complete information and to refrain from impersonating or falsely representing your affiliation with any person or entity (such information being “Member Data”). Member Data and certain other information about you and/or your business are subject to our Privacy Policy. You agree and acknowledge that Member Data from the registration process is used to send you information about SeamlessChex and the Service, including, but not limited to, the use of your email address for newsletters and other necessary SeamlessChex communication.

Such content is not under the control of SeamlessChex and SeamlessChex is not responsible for such content, including, without limitation, any link contained in such content, or any changes or updates to such content. SeamlessChex is providing such Third Party Content to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of such content does not imply endorsement by SeamlessChex of such content or the affiliate. You may be subject to additional and/or different terms, conditions, and privacy policies when you use third party services, content, software, or sites. SeamlessChex does reserve the right to remove content that, in SeamlessChex’s judgment, does not meet its standards, but SeamlessChex is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material. SeamlessChex is not and will not be responsible for (i) the terms and conditions of any transaction between you and any third party, (ii) any insufficiency of or problems with any such third party's background, insurance, credit or licensing, or (iii) the quality of services performed by any such third party or any other legal liability arising out of or related to the performance of such services. In the event that you have a dispute with any such third party, you release SeamlessChex (and its affiliates, suppliers, agents and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

SEAMLESSCHEX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, AND WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT, OR OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL, PROFITS, INVESTMENTS, USE OF MONEY, OR USE OF FACILITIES; INTERRUPTION IN USE OR AVAILABILITY OF DATA; STOPPAGE OF OTHER WORK OR IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER ASSETS; OR LABOR CLAIMS), EVEN IF SEAMLESSCHEX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SEAMLESSCHEX’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED A MAXIMUM OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000.00) REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.    
  
(C)  For any applicable Services used by you, SeamlessChex will use industry standard practices to ensure that all pre-installed software is correctly configured. In case there is more than one way to configure any software, SeamlessChex will choose the configuration it determines, in its sole discretion, to be the most appropriate. SeamlessChex will install security patches, updates, and service packs as soon as practical. Software updates may change system behavior and functionality and as such may negatively affect your applications. SeamlessChex cannot foresee nor can it be responsible for service disruption or changes in functionality or performance due to implementation of software patches and upgrades. If such disruption or changes occur, SeamlessChex will provide its best efforts to remedy the situation as soon as possible after being notified of such problem by you.  SeamlessChex shall be in no way responsible for any loss or corruption of software used pursuant to the Services and loss or corruption of your data archived and/or placed with SeamlessChex in any event.  You understands that SeamlessChex has informed them that loss or corruption of software and data may occur that is beyond the control of SeamlessChex and SeamlessChex has informed you that they strongly recommend that you maintain a complete data backup and software backup which is independent from SeamlessChex and a disaster recovery plan. Neither SeamlessChex and/or you shall be liable to the other for any failure to perform or delay in performance of any Agreement where such failure or delay is occasioned by Force Majeure or an Act of God (including but not limited to fire, embargo, labor strike or interruption of electrical services), or circumstances beyond such party’s control.  
  
**Article 10: SeamlessChex Software Licenses**  
SeamlessChex provides you with a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use SeamlessChex’s software, which you agree to use in accordance with this Agreement. You may not sub-license, or charge others to use or access, our software without first obtaining written permission from us.

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SeamlessChex, its employees, members, directors, managers, officers or agents from and against any loss, liability, damage, penalty or expense (including attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and cost of defense) they may suffer or incur as a result of  (i) any failure by you or any employee, agent or you of you to comply with the terms of this Agreement; (ii) any warranty or representation made by you being false or misleading; (iii) any representation or warranty made by you or any employee or agent of You to any third person other than as specifically authorized by this Agreement, (iv) negligence of you or your subcontractors, agents or employees, or (v) any alleged or actual violations by you or your subcontractors, employees or agents of any card association rules, governmental laws, regulations or rules.  
  
**Article 12: Marketing Obligations & Compliance with Telemarketing Laws**  
You agree that you, and not SeamlessChex, are solely responsible for ensuring that its implementation and use of the Services, including, but not limited to any text-payments, text marketing, and email marketing complies with, and you agree to comply with, all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, and all rules promulgated by any regulatory authority or any payment card network, including but not limited to those of Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover, in each case as amended from time to time by relevant authority.

You acknowledge and agree that SeamlessChex does not tolerate any violation of law, regulation, rule, including any Telemarketing Law in the performance of your obligations under this Agreement (i.e., there shall be no robo-calls, press 1 campaigns, text messaging, facsimile blasts, etc.). SeamlessChex shall not be liable for any violation of Telemarketing Laws by you, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in addition to the indemnity obligations set forth under the Agreement, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SeamlessChex, its employees, members, managers, referral partners and agents from and against any claims, loss, liability, damage, assessment, penalty or expense (including attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and cost of defense) they may suffer or incur arising out of or related to Merchant’s use of the Services or violation of any Telemarketing Law, including but not limited to any fees, costs, losses, fines, assessments, or other penalties for noncompliance with any applicable laws.  
  
**Article 13: Copyright and Trademark Notices**  
All materials on the SeamlessChex Web Site (as well as the organization and layout of the SeamlessChex Web Site) are owned and copyrighted or licensed by SeamlessChex, its affiliates or its suppliers. All rights reserved. No reproduction, distribution, or transmission of the copyrighted materials at the SeamlessChex Web Site is permitted without the written permission of SeamlessChex. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.   Without SeamlessChex’s prior permission, you agree not to display or use in any manner, any of SeamlessChex trademarks, whether registered or not.   
  
**Article 14 Intellectual Property**  
"Intellectual Property" means all of the following owned by a party:  (i) trademarks and service marks (registered and unregistered) and trade names, and goodwill associated therewith; (ii) patents, patentable inventions, computer programs, and software; (iii) databases; (iv) trade secrets and the right to limit the use or disclosure thereof; (v) copyrights in all works, including software programs; and (vi) domain names.  The rights owned by a party in its Intellectual Property shall be defined, collectively, as "Intellectual Property Rights."  Other than the express licenses granted by this Agreement, SeamlessChex grants no right or license to you by implication, estoppel or otherwise to any Intellectual Property Rights of SeamlessChex.  Each party shall retain all ownership rights, title, and interest in and to its own products and services and all intellectual property rights therein, subject only to the rights and licenses specifically granted herein.  SeamlessChex (and not you) shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to pursue copyright and patent protection, in its sole discretion, for any Intellectual Property Rights incorporated therein.  You will cooperate with SeamlessChex in pursuing such protection, including without limitation executing and delivering to SeamlessChex such instruments as may be required to register or perfect SeamlessChex’s interests in any Intellectual Property Rights and any assignments thereof.  You shall not remove or destroy any proprietary, confidentiality, trademark, service mark, or copyright markings or notices placed upon or contained in any materials or documentation received from SeamlessChex in connection with this Agreement. SeamlessChex shall own all rights, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to any improvements to the existing SeamlessChex products or services and/or any new programs, upgrades, modifications or enhancements developed by SeamlessChex in connection with rendering any Service to you, even when the same result from yours request.  To the extent, if any, that ownership in such refinements and improvements does not automatically vest in SeamlessChex by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, you hereby transfer and assign (and, if applicable, shall cause its affiliates to transfer and assign) to SeamlessChex all rights, title, and interest which you or any of its affiliates may have in and to such refinements and improvements.  You will take all necessary action to assure SeamlessChex’s property rights to its Intellectual Property Rights and any extensions thereunder will be protected.  
  
**Article 15: Modification**  
SeamlessChex reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that SeamlessChex shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.  
  
**Article 16 Termination and Cancellation**  
The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period of two (2) years, commencing on the date first set forth below.  This Agreement shall thereafter be automatically renewed for additional terms of one (1) year each unless either party notifies the other no later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current term that it does not wish to renew this Agreement.   SeamlessChex may cancel this Agreement for any reason, or no reason at all, by providing you with seven (7) days notice. If you violate any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, by not paying required amounts to SeamlessChex, you shall remain responsible for payment of all the remaining fees and costs that would have otherwise been due for the remainder of the then-current term.  The parties expressly agree that the damages, which they might reasonably anticipate to be sustained by SeamlessChex, are difficult to ascertain and measure because of their indefiniteness or uncertainty and that the amount set forth above is a reasonable estimate of the damages that would probably be caused and shall be due regardless of proof of actual damages.  All other provisions of this Agreement which may reasonably be construed as surviving such termination will survive the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.  
  
**Article 17 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Arbitration**  
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to conflict of law provisions. Any action, proceeding, arbitration or mediation relating to or arising from this Agreement must be brought, held, or otherwise occur in the federal judicial district that includes New York. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING. Any claim, dispute or controversy ("Claim") by either you or us against the other, or against the employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, beneficiaries, agents or assigns of the other, arising from or relating in any way to this Agreement or to our relationship, including Claims regarding the applicability of this arbitration clause or the validity of the entire Agreement, shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association, under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the Claim is filed, except as otherwise provided below. All Claims are subject to arbitration, no matter what theory they are based on or what remedy they seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law. Claims and remedies sought as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative action are subject to arbitration on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be limited solely to the Claim between you and us. The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis. If either party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against the other, the non-prevailing party will reimburse the prevailing party for any fees it paid to the American Arbitration Association in connection with the arbitration, as well as for any reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such arbitration. Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. Any arbitration hearing at which you appear will take place at a location within the federal judicial district that includes New York. This arbitration agreement applies to all Claims now in existence or that may arise in the future. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent any party's use of (or advancement of any Claims, defenses or offsets in) bankruptcy or repossession, replevin, judicial foreclosure or any other prejudgment or provisional remedy relating to any collateral, security or other property interests for contractual debts now or hereafter owed by either party to the other. IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND SEAMLESSCHEX MAY OTHERWISE HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR A JURY, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE OR BE REPRESENTED IN LITIGATION FILED IN COURT BY OTHERS (INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS), BUT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED ABOVE, THOSE RIGHTS, INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, ARE WAIVED AND ALL CLAIMS MUST NOW BE RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOU AND SEAMLESSCHEX AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.  
  
**Article 18: Force Majeure**  
Any delay or failure of either party to perform its obligations will be excused to the extent that the delay or failure was caused solely and directly by an event beyond such party’s control, without such party’s fault or negligence and that by its nature could not have been foreseen by such party or, if it could have been foreseen, was unavoidable (which events may include natural disasters, embargoes, explosions, riots, wars, or acts of terrorism) (each, a “Force Majeure Event”). However, your financial inability to perform; changes in cost or availability of materials, components or services; change in market conditions; or labor disputes or other contract disputes involving or affecting you will not excuse performance by you under this section, and will not constitute a Force Majeure Event. A party shall give the other party prompt written notice of any event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to result in a Force Majeure Event, and the anticipated duration of such Force Majeure Event. A party shall use all diligent efforts to end the Force Majeure Event, ensure that the effects of the Force Majeure Event are minimized, and resume full performance under the Agreement as soon as commercially reasonable. We are permitted (but not required) to procure substitute goods or services for any goods or services that are delayed or unavailable as a result of a Force Majeure Event.  
  
**Article 19: General Terms**  
You acknowledge, understand, and agree that the Agreement, this agreement, and our relationship is non-exclusive. Nothing in the Agreement or otherwise shall in any way limit our right to do business with others and/or allow access and/or use of the Services by others.  If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions not so declared shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect, but shall be construed in a manner so as to effectuate the intent of this Agreement as a whole, notwithstanding such stricken provision or provisions.  No provision of this Agreement shall be construed against any party merely because that party or counsel drafted or revised the provision in question.  All parties have been advised and have had an opportunity to consult with legal counsel of their choosing regarding the force and effect of the terms set forth herein.  This Agreement shall be deemed to be jointly prepared by the parties and therefore any ambiguity or uncertainty shall be interpreted accordingly.  No term or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed waived and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party claimed to have waived or consented.  Any consent by any party to, or waiver of, a breach by the other party, whether express or implied, shall not constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any different or subsequent breach.  You may not assign this Agreement without the written consent of SeamlessChex.  SeamlessChex may assign this Agreement in its sole discretion without the written consent of you.  The section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenient reference only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  This Agreement, including all schedules, exhibits and attachments thereto, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, partner, employee or representative of any party hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure only to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer or shall be deemed to confer upon any persons or entities not parties to this Agreement, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (irrespective of its choice of law principles).  This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same the same instrument.  Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.  By executing this Agreement by electronic means, Agent acknowledges that under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign), this Agreement and all electronically executed documents incorporated into this Agreement or related hereto are legally binding in the same manner as are hard copy documents executed by hand signature when (i) your electronic signature is associated with the Agreement and the incorporated or related documents, (ii) you consents and intends to be bound by the Agreement and the incorporated or related documents, and (iii) the Agreement is delivered in an electronic record capable of retention by the recipient at the time of receipt (i.e., print or otherwise store the electronic record).
