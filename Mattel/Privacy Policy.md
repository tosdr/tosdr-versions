Mattel Privacy Statement
========================

At Mattel, we empower generations to explore the wonder of childhood and reach their full potential.

This Privacy Statement is where we tell you how Mattel, including our affiliates and subsidiaries (including, but not solely, Mattel, Inc., Fisher-Price, Inc., American Girl Brands, LLC, HIT Entertainment Limited, Mega Brands Inc. their affiliate and subsidiaries) (collectively, “Mattel”) handle your personal information and let you tell us what we can do with it. Mattel’s complete list of entities, affiliates, and subsidiaries (“Mattel Group of Companies”) can be found [here](https://shop.mattel.com/mattel-group-of-companies). This Privacy Statement applies to personal data collected and processed by Mattel through our websites, applications, features, or other services that post a link to this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Services”), as well as personal data collected and held by Mattel offline, which we may combine with online data.

When we talk about “personal information” or “personal data,” we mean information that tells us who you are, where you live, and how we can contact you. We get this information in many ways and from many different places, including from third parties. Some personal information we collect may be considered “sensitive” under various applicable laws. It can be things you give to us directly, like your name, phone number, and email address when you sign up for an account or buy something from us. It can also be things you cannot see that we collect from your computer or mobile phone while you are on our websites, mobile apps, or social media channels. The personal information we collect, such as IP addresses, cookie identifiers, or mobile phone IDs, allow us to send you videos and other content about our toys, movies, and games that we think you may like to see.

In some instances, to comply with good privacy practices and the law, we may de-identify or pseudonymize previously personal information so that it becomes non-personal, such as aggregating and/or or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as “hash”, or otherwise removing characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. If we combine non-personal information with personal information, then we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Statement.

By accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with any part of the Services, or by otherwise providing personal data to Mattel, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Statement and the applicable Terms and Conditions of Use which govern your use of the Services. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Statement and the applicable Terms and Conditions, do not access or use the Services or provide personal data to us.

A cookie identifies your computer or mobile device. It does not show who you are by name, but does let us know you or someone in your household used the same computer or mobile device that visited a website earlier and can in some situations be connected to a name or a household. It will usually be a file named something like—abc@example.com.txt. If you open one of these files, it will show some random letters and numbers like: “HMP1example.com/04058205\*”.

There are different types of cookies. The most common are session cookies, which are temporary. They are used by nearly all websites to allow things like shopping carts to work, even if you aren't logged in to your account. They simply tell the server that all your requests came from the same computer and should be treated as a single visit to a website. These temporary cookies are deleted when your visit is over, or after a period of no activity (when you make no keystrokes or your mouse stops moving, after about 20 minutes or so).

Permanent cookies, also called persistent cookies, are also common. These cookies are used to identify your computer or mobile device over multiple visits to a website. These are the ones that handle your request to "Remember Me" or "Keep Me Logged In" to a website or app.

These permanent cookies are also used to send you advertisements based on the websites you visit and the content you view during those visits.

They are also used to tell us how long you stay on a site, how you move through the site, and other activities like the content you view or the mouse clicks that you make. They are also used to count the number of visitors to a site, as well as how often returning visitors come back. Website owners use this information to understand how well their websites are doing and to make decisions about how to design the site.

You can choose whether to accept cookies by editing your browser settings. For more information about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### **Types of Cookies We Use**

For a list of our major technology partners for our Mattel Sites, and the choices and controls they may offer about collection and use of information, read the [THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LIST](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt485dfa12bf05dba5/bltd15c49511e8547da/6491ae2cf7411bf3f837dbfd/Third_Party_Technology_List_June2023.pdf).

**Required/Strictly Necessary Cookies.** They make our websites work. Without them, you may not be able to view web pages and video content or buy something because the ability to store your information in a shopping cart has been turned off. 

**Functional Cookies.** They make our websites work better. For example, when you choose to read a site in Spanish on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in the Spanish language. Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more user-friendly for you. 

**Analytics Cookies.** They are a type of functional cookie that tells us how well our websites are working. For example, we can learn how many visitors to our websites buy something and how many leave without viewing or clicking on anything. 

**Advertising Cookies.** They tell us what you are interested in based on the websites you visit and the products you buy. That information allows us to send you ads, videos, and other content that better fit the things you like or need. They also allow us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.  

### **Other Technologies We May Use**

**Proximity-Based Beacons.** These are small, wireless transmitters that use low energy Bluetooth technology to send signals to other smart devices in their proximity and can be used by mobile applications you have installed on your phone to help locate a device’s location. We may use beacons when your device interacts with the Services, typically through a mobile application, to give you information about products as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device one-way when you get close enough and only after you have given permission in your device settings. 

**Pixels.** These are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as web beacons or tags) that may be included in our web pages and email messages. These and similar technologies may be used by us and our third-party providers for a number of purposes, including to deliver advertising cookies to your computer or for other marketing and targeted advertising purposes, monitor website activity like counting visitors to the Services, monitor how users navigate the Services, or how many particular products were viewed, make logging into our websites easier, and monitor whether you open our emails or click any links included in our email.

**APIs and SDKs.** We use tools provided in Software Development Kits (“SDKs”), such as embedded scripts, to collect information through mobile devices, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network data, and website usage behavior. SDKs are software packages that contain a set of tools that can be used to help build applications and implement new features in existing apps including those that collect data from your device.

In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar data for security, fraud detection, and maintenance purposes.

### **Interest-Based Advertising/Third-party Advertising & Analytics Companies & Similar Third Parties**

We may use third-party business partners, such as analytics companies, ad agencies, network advertisers, and others who provide us data about the Services, users, and our advertisements (such as what products and services you’re interested in based on the websites you visit, the content you view online, and the products you buy). These partners deliver ads to you on behalf of the Services and elsewhere online. We and our third-party business partners collect certain data about your visits to and activity on the Services and other websites and services, and may use this data to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need and to assess the effectiveness of our advertising. We may also share (or permit third parties to collect) certain data, such as Device ID/Interaction Information, aggregated or de-identified, pseudonymized or hashed data (including email addresses), with these third parties for similar purposes.

These third-parties may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies, pixel tags or other technologies) and may otherwise collect or have access to your personal data over time, including about your visits to the Services as well as other websites and online services, some of which may be personal information or personal data under various local laws. Companies that we share data with, including ad agencies and networks, may use the data, often in combination with their existing data, in order to present more relevant advertisements that may be of interest to you, and to help us and third parties to do the same.

**Here are some examples of our interest-based advertising practices:**

1. We Learn About People Who Have Similar Interests. We may learn that people who buy children’s clothing also buy toys and games for children within that same age range. Knowing this, we may send ads for toys and games to people who bought children’s clothing because they behave like or “look like” shoppers who tend to also buy toys and games in the same age range.
2. We Combine Information About You from Many Different Sources. We combine information from many different sources, such as how much money you make, your age, gender, and number of people in your family, and the things you buy on and offline. For example, if we know what you have bought from in-store loyalty card swipes, we can send you online information about the things you have already shown interest in offline. In this way, your experience as a consumer is more personal across all your buying channels.
3. We Know You Across All of Your Devices. Linking together your computers, tablets, and phones allows you to log into your account from all your devices or pick up where you left off in a video or movie that you were viewing on a different device. For example, you might search for our entertainment content on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later be able to purchase that same product after seeing an ad on your mobile phone.
4. We Match You Across all Accounts. We may share your email address with social media companies or use their technology on our websites so that we can communicate with you when you are on social media. We also do this matching to learn if you saw our ad on social media, and if you clicked on it, and then came to our website to buy something. This helps us know if we should continue to buy ads on social media.

**Our Tools.** You can control how your personal information is used for interest-based advertising by visiting [_the Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536). You can also opt out of certain cookies by modifying your [cookie settings](https://consent-pref.trustarc.com/?type=mattel_prod_us_v3&site=mattel.com&country=us&action=prefmgr&locale=en&behavior=implied&gtm=1&autoblock=true&behaviorManager=us&irm=false). You can also go to [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) to download the GPC web browser plugin that tells our website your privacy preferences for cookies. We will honor your privacy rights according to the GPC signal you set. We will honor your privacy rights according to the GPC signal you set.

**NAI/DAA Opt-Out.** Some of the companies we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The NAI provides information regarding targeted advertising and the [opt-out procedures of NAI members](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/), including opt-out mechanisms for web browsers, mobile and other connected devices, and a tool to opt out from participating NAI members using your hashed email address for interest-based advertising. You may also want to visit the [DAA's website](https://optout.aboutads.info/), which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an opt-out for DAA-participating companies. To learn more about interest-based advertisements from participating third parties in Canada, please visit the Canadian DAA online choice page at [https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools](https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools).

**Google Analytics.** We use Google Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about the use of the Services and report on activities and trends. The Services may also collect information about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can [learn about Google's practices](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), and opt out of them by downloading the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)[.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Please note that opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising from Mattel. You will continue to see non-targeted advertisements from many companies, possibly even Mattel, while online. In other words, in the case you have expressed your opt-out by the above methods, some online ads will still appear, but these will not benefit from the information Mattel could have otherwise used that is specific to you or your browsing history. The same way a printed newspaper advertisement addresses a large number of readers generally and no one reader in particular, your advertisements after opt-out will be general in nature and are placed by Mattel to advertise to the general public. Your opt-out choices are also browser and device specific; if you disable your cookies or upgrade your browser after opting out, or if you use different computers or browsers, you will need to indicate your opt-out choices across those other computers and browsers.

### **Other Websites & Mobile Application Content**

**Precise Location Data.** We always get your permission before knowing the exact location of your device (also called “precise geolocation”). You may turn off collection of precise location data by adjusting your browser or device settings. Despite this, Mattel may collect and know less specific location information, for example, that your device is anywhere within a broader city, postal code, state or province based on other data we collect, such as IP address, without asking for your permission (called “approximate” or “general location”). For example, we will not seek your permission before knowing you are somewhere in Barcelona, Spain.

**Session Replay Technology.** Mattel may record your interactions with the Services, such as what pages you visit on the Services, how long you visit those pages, and any links you click or information you provide. We use this information for our internal business purposes, such as for website analytics, to improve the Services and our products and services, and to address functionality issues.

**Plugins.** They collect and send information back to the company that created them when you have an account with them and are signed into their services. An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button. Plugins function according to the privacy policies and terms of the company that created them, even though they may appear on our Services.

**Logins.** You may log in to our services using your account with another company such as, for example, “Login with Google.” We have access only to the information you allow us to receive from your account settings with that other company. Like plugins, function according to the privacy policies and terms of the company that created them, even though they may appear on our Services.

**User Content.** We may offer features where you can submit data to us, including to post or submit, without limitation, information, comments, reviews, messages, text, files, photos, videos, or other content you provide (“User Content”). Your Submission of User Content is governed by our [Terms and Conditions](https://corporate.mattel.com/terms-conditions). Anything you post publicly becomes public information and others will have access to it and may use it or share it with third parties. We do not control how others who have access to your information may use your posts, videos, photographs, comments, and other content you create and publicly post and the use of your data by third parties is not subject to this Privacy Statement.

**Third-party Content and Links.** Our Services may include content that is served by someone else or links to third-party content or sites we do not control. The third-party operators and content providers use their own cookies or other tracking technology, and they may independently collect data from or about you. Mattel is not responsible for the privacy policies and terms or practices employed by any third-party.

For a list of our major technology partners for our mobile apps, please see the [MOBILE THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LIST](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt485dfa12bf05dba5/blt8ae158fc892eb615/672d14cf3bea8f442c121e8e/Mobile_Third_Party_Technology_List_2024.pdf).

**How We Get Your Personal Information**
----------------------------------------

### **You Share it Directly**

You give your personal information to us. It can be things like your name, phone number, and email address when you sign up for an account or buy something from us.

### **You Interact with Websites, Mobile Apps & Emails**

We collect your personal information in ways you cannot see from your computer or mobile phone while you are on our websites, mobile apps, and social media channels. Things like mobile phone IDs allow us to send you videos and other content about our toys, movies, and games that we think you may like to see.

### **We Get it From Other Companies**

We may receive data about you from third parties, such as data aggregators, joint marketing partners, third-party websites, service providers and other business partners. We get data from third parties in order to provide you with information or services you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for other purposes.

This may include contact information, such as your email or mailing address, so that we may contact you if you express interest in our Services.

You may have given another company permission to share your personal information with us. For example, you may have done this when creating a social media account or joined a loyalty/rewards program with another company. We sometimes buy it from publicly available databases or third parties who enhance the data we have about you. For example, they may sell us information about the number of people in your family and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.

The data collected and stored by third parties is subject solely to the third-party’s privacy practices. Third parties may also share or sell it without your permission if the law allows them to do so. You can request other companies to stop selling and sharing your personal information by visiting their website and reading their privacy notice.

**When We Disclose Your Personal Information**
----------------------------------------------

We may share non-personal data that we collect, such as certain Device ID/Interaction Information, aggregate user statistics, and hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized data (including email addresses), and/or our analyses derived from such data, with third-parties in our discretion as permitted by law, including for targeted advertising purposes. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party. If you decide that you do not want to receive communications from a third-party, or have questions about their privacy practices, you will need to contact that third-party directly. We may share the data we have collected about you (including personal data) in the circumstances described below or elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, as disclosed at the time you provide data, or otherwise with your consent.

### **When You Direct Us to Share or Otherwise with Your Consent**

We may share your personal information when you expressly consent or otherwise direct us to do so. by law.

### **Social Media and Other Third-Party Platforms**

We may share your personal information with social media companies or use their technology on our websites so that we can send you videos, ads, or other content when you are on social media channels that you signed up for with them. These third-party social media companies may be able to collect certain data about your visits to the Services regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the third-party social media company. We work with social media companies to learn if you saw our ad on social media, and if you clicked on it, and then came to our website to buy something. This helps us know if we should continue to buy ads on social media.

If you choose to share content or to otherwise post data through the Services to a third-party social media channel, or vice versa, that data may be publicly displayed. Similarly, as permitted by applicable law, if you post data on a social media channel that references us (for example, by using a hashtag associated with us in your post), your post may be published on the Services or otherwise in accordance with the terms of that third-party. Also, both we and the third-party may have access to certain data about you and your use of the Services and the third-party social media channel. In addition, as you may agree to with a third-party service, we may receive data about you if other users give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or data about you is otherwise accessible through your profile or similar page. The data collected and stored by the third-party remains subject to the third-party’s privacy practices, including whether the third-party continues to share data with us, the types of data shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but may retain the information previously collected.

### **We Share it With Our Vendors & Service Providers**

We may share your personal information with other companies who help us run our business. This includes those who run our websites, deliver marketing emails, send ads, help us to understand how our sites and ads are working and what we can do better, and to run credit card payments for us. Our service providers will use your personal information only to help us do these things. Our contracts with them prevent them from selling your personal information to other companies or using it in any other way. Additionally, we may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activities with our fraud prevention and similar service providers, and they will use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions.

### **We Share it for Sweepstakes, Contests, Promotions**

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions (any, a "Promotion"), that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the provisions, conditions, or official rules that govern the Promotion, which may require specific requirements of you (including, without limitation, and except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing materials). If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal data may be disclosed to third-parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s terms or official rules (such as on a winners list).

Mattel may disclose your personal information in other circumstances as necessary for administrative or legal purposes. For example, we may provide personal information about you to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law, when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to respond to requests from government authorities. There may be instances when we may use or disclose your personal information in order to protect or defend the legal rights, property or operations of Mattel or our employees or agents; to protect the rights, privacy, safety or security of users, members or others; to protect against fraud; and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

### **Business Transfers and Transitions**

In the event Mattel goes through a transition (such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of all or a portion of its assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process), your data (including your personal information) will likely be among the assets transferred. By providing your personal information, you agree that we may transfer such data to the acquiring entity without your further consent, except where required by law.

**Children’s Personal Information & Online Safety**
---------------------------------------------------

Last Updated: May 14, 2024

This Children’s Privacy Statement applies only to the websites or platforms targeted toward users younger than the age of 13 (“**Child”** or “**Children**”) that are owned by Mattel, including our affiliates and subsidiaries (including, without limitation, Mattel, Inc. Fisher-Price, Inc., American Girl Brands, LLC, HIT Entertainment Limited, Mega Brands Inc. and their affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “**Mattel**”). This Statement provides details regarding data we may collect from Children and supplements our [Privacy Statement](https://corporate.mattel.com/privacy-statement). This Statement applies to personal information collected and processed by Mattel through our websites (the “**Mattel Sites**”), applications, features, or other services that post a link to this Children’s Privacy Statement (collectively, the “**Mattel Services**”).

For information about how Mattel treats data collected from or about users aged 13 and older, please see our [Privacy Statement](https://corporate.mattel.com/privacy-statement), including the specific sections that might apply to where you live. 

### **What Are Mattel’s Children’s Privacy Practices? (Summary)**

Mattel Services which are directed to and accessed by Children call for certain more restrictive privacy practices. Some Mattel Sites or areas of Mattel Sites with content directed toward Children can be identified by “kids” or “play” in the domain or subdomain. Content intended for adults may be available at such Mattel Sites, accessible through a “parents” link.

* We do not collect Personal Information from Children through Mattel Services directed to Children without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable law.
* We may ask a Child for certain information that we do not associate with any Personal Information we have collected about your Child and would not re-display to other users, like their birthdate (if we are restricting certain ages from certain Mattel Services) or to customize their experience by collecting non-identifying information like their gender, their likes and dislikes, and hobbies, etc. This information may be used in aggregated form to help us understand our visitors and improve our products and Mattel services.
* We do not ask for more Personal Information than is necessary for a Child to participate in the activity.
* We take steps to prevent Children from posting or publicly disclosing Personal Information without parental consent, such as monitoring or screening and use of filtering technology.

If you are the parent of guardian of a Child who uses the Mattel Services and have questions, you may contact us using the information in the “[Contact Us](https://shop.mattel.com/privacy-statement#anchor-contact-us)” information referenced at the bottom of our [Privacy Statement](https://corporate.mattel.com/privacy-statement).

### **What Information Does Mattel Collect from Children and How Is It Used?**

Mattel might collect an email address and first name (or screen name) from your Child without your consent, but only in the following special cases:

* To participate in special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages, games or clubs, we might ask your Child to register. They can often do so anonymously by just providing a first name or username, and password. When we ask for your Child’s first name, we encourage them to use a “screen name” (not their real name) that only they know. Sometimes we will ask your Child to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas of Mattel Services. As COPPA requires, we will get your permission should we ask your child to provide additional Personal Information to participate in such activities.
* We may sometimes need a Child’s email address, your email address, or both. We may ask a Child for your email address, so we can notify you of your Child’s interest in Mattel Services. In the limited circumstances where we might collect your Child’s email address without getting your consent first, we ask your Child for your email or mailing address so that we can notify you of your Child’s request and get your permission or give you an opportunity to opt-out. When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information you or your Child provides us, and how you can review your Child’s information and ask us to delete the information. With your consent, we may collect other Personal Information from your Child such as a last name or home address, if the information is necessary for a particular activity. We provide further detail about the instances in which we may request such consent from you below.
* If a Child sends a request to us, we keep their email address for long enough to respond to them. Mattel deletes this information from our system after we answer their question. In the case of “send a friend” emails, we do not ask for your Child’s email address and only use the friends’ email address to send the message, after which the friends’ email addresses are deleted.
* If a Child signs up for an email newsletter or other activity that requires multiple online contacts with the Child, we also ask the Child for a parent’s or legal guardian’s email address, so we can notify you and give you an opportunity to opt out.
* Occasionally, Mattel has special activities or promotions, like sweepstakes or contests that are open to Children. We ask your Child to give us your email address, so that we can tell you that they have registered in a promotion or for a service. If we need more than an email address and first name (or screen name) to enter your Child in the promotion, award a prize, or offer the service, we will notify you, explain what information we need and why, and generally ask that you (not your Child) provide it. For instance, we might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send any prizes your Child wins to you, or for your phone number so that we can contact you if your Child has won. Any information we receive from you or your Child in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete.
* As otherwise permitted by COPPA.

Mattel may collect and store other Personal Information about Children if it is submitted by a Child with prior parental consent. Specifically, Mattel may collect Personal Information about a Child in the following instances:

* We may offer enhanced Mattel Services, including subscription-based Mattel Services, which require a parent to register and establish the appropriate permission level for the Child. Content and activities available may vary depending on the Service. Parents will be provided with information on the type of content and activities their Child may access at the time they register and are always responsible for and in charge of their Child’s account. Subscription fees may apply for some Services.
* We do not keep your (or your Child’s) email address unless you tell us it is okay. If social networking opportunities are available through Mattel Services, they are structured so that no Personal Information is shared between visitors unless parental consent is obtained. Similarly, no Personal Information is collected from Children to participate in these features except as described in this section, with parental consent, or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.

### **Automatically Collected Information**

We use persistent identifiers, such as tracking technology, like cookies, for internal operations such as to recognize visitors by their username when they use or revisit Mattel Services, to screen for age, and to provide us important information that helps us understand features and gauge interest. We may also use technology for similar purposes in our apps.

We also use such technology and work with third-party technology partners to facilitate the ability to play games, to recognize returning visitors, for research, and for other purposes, including to screen under-age visitors from certain features or areas intended for older visitors, and for other internal purposes. You may review additional information about these technologies in the section below.

The technologies that may be used to collect information include:

* **Cookies**. A cookie is a data file placed on your computer or other device when you visit the Mattel Services or otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as supporting functionality, for internal analytics and similar internal purposes.
* **Pixel Tags.** We or our third-party service providers (such content providers and analytics companies) may set pixel tags (small graphic images or other web programming code, also known as “web beacons” or "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") and similar technologies on the Mattel Services. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Mattel Services, to monitor how users navigate the sites, and to improve your experience.
* **Embedded Scripts.** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Mattel Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

### **Disclosure of Children’s Personal Information**

Mattel may disclose Children's Personal Information to service providers who provide support for the internal operations of the Mattel Services and who do not disclose or use the Personal Information for any other purpose. These service providers may provide support services such as hosting the Mattel Services, designing and/or operating the features, or performing other administrative services. Mattel may provide these companies with access to Children's Personal Information in order for them to carry out the services they are performing on Mattel’s behalf. These service providers have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of this Personal Information they obtain from Mattel.

We may also disclose Personal Information to third parties when necessary to protect the security or integrity of the Mattel Service; take precautions against liability; respond to judicial process; or provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety.

### **Third-party Links/Can My Child Access the Web Through Mattel Services?**

Your Child can navigate to the general internet through links to third-party web sites available on the Mattel Services that Mattel does not control. Mattel is not responsible for the privacy or data collection practices of any third-party. Third-party websites, online services, or apps that can be accessed through a Mattel Service are governed by the third-party’s privacy practices, and not this Privacy Statement. We recommend that you check the applicable privacy statement and terms of use each time you use any website, online service, or app so you understand how your and your Children’s Personal Information will be collected and used, and by whom.

We encourage you to spend time with your Children when they are online or using any mobile device or connected product so you understand the features of the Mattel Services and the activities they allow, and to adopt available device and browser controls that reflect your preferences about your Children’s ability to access the internet or make purchases online.

### **Can I Access, Update, and Review Information You Have About My Child?**

If you no longer want your Child to participate in an email newsletter, simply click on the link that is provided to unsubscribe, which is usually located at the bottom of the email, or contact us at [service@mattel.com](mailto:service@mattel.com) for Mattel, Fisher-Price, HIT Entertainment, and MEGA Brands; or [service@americangirl.com](mailto:service@americangirl.com) for American Girl.

You may also request to review and delete all Personal Information Mattel has collected about your Child and cease all further collection or use of such Personal Information by submitting a request for Access or Deletion using [_the Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536).

### **A special note to Children**

Children should get a parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before giving out personal contact information or any other Personal Information, to Mattel or to anyone else.

### **Changes to this Statement**

Mattel may update this Children’s Privacy Statement at any time and any changes will be effective upon posting. Where required by COPPA, we will obtain additional parental consent prior to using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner materially different from the purpose for which it was collected.

**Exercising Your California Rights**

California Consumers have the right to request: (1) that we disclose to you what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell/share, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (“**Right to Know**”); (2) that we delete the personal information we have collected from you (“**Right to Delete**”); and, (3) that we correct inaccurate personal information we hold about you (**“Right to Correct**”); (4) to opt out from the sharing of your personal information and sensitive personal information to a third-party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e. targeted advertising) (“**Right to Opt-Out of Sharing**”); (5) to opt-out from the sale of personal information and sensitive personal information (“**Right to Opt-Out of Sale**”); and (6) that we limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information to purposes set forth in the statute, including that use which is necessary and anticipated to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests those goods or services (“**Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information**”), all subject to the meanings and exceptions set forth in the CCPA and CPRA. More information on each of these rights is below.

In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request if we cannot verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.

**Verifying Your Requests**

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making.

When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct Inaccurate Information, we may ask that you provide us with information, beyond your full name, in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.

**Agents**

If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a user's behalf, please complete the applicable request per the instructions below. We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request, and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer's identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer's behalf, we may deny the request.

**Right to Know**

California Consumers have the right to know what information we have collected about you (the categories and the specific pieces of information). If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, please go to the [_Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536) or 1-800-524-8697.

**Right to Delete**

California Consumers have the right to request that we delete information we have collected from you. If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Delete, please go to the [_Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536) or 1-800-524-8697.

**Right to Correct Inaccurate Information**

California Consumers have the right to request that we correct inaccurate information we hold about you. If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Correct, please go to the [_Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536) or 1-800-524-8697.

**Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information**

Under the CPRA, a business must only provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information when such Sensitive Personal Information is collected or processed for the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer, or does not fall under certain statutory exceptions, pursuant to CPRA §1798.121. Mattel does not use Sensitive Personal Information for such purpose and/or its use or disclosure falls within the statutory exceptions. Therefore, the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information is not triggered under the law at this time.

**Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information or Sharing for Cross Contextual Behavioral Advertising**

California consumers have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of your personal information or sensitive personal information or “sharing” for cross contextual behavioral advertising. Mattel does not sell your personal information for monetary compensation, but as discussed above, Mattel engages in certain online advertising practices (and third-party analytics and similar activities), which may be considered a “sale” or “share” for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising), whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.

If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Opt-Out of “Sale” or “Sharing”, please go to the [_Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536) or 1-800-524-8697.

**Users Younger than Age 16**

Mattel does not knowingly sell or share Personal Information of users younger than 16 years of age.

**Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer's Privacy Rights**

California consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA and CPRA rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA and CPRA rights.

**Do Not Track**

Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals offered by some web browsers are settings that request that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. To learn more about DNT, please go to [https://globalprivacycontrol.org](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) to download the GPC web browser plugin that tells our website your privacy preferences for cookies. We will honor your privacy rights according to the GPC signal you set.

**Notice of Financial Incentive**

Under California regulations, certain programs we offer that provide benefits to consumers may be considered financial incentive programs. We may collect personal information from you in connection with these programs, e.g., such as contact information (name, email address, phone number) and certain commercial information (e.g., purchase history) for a number of reasons, including to administer the program, contact you with regard to your account (if any), to provide the benefits to you, to better serve you, and to fulfill your requests associated with the program.

To opt into the programs, you may need to provide certain information, register for an account and agree to the applicable program terms, or otherwise follow the instructions associated with that applicable program. Please also see the terms of the program you are joining for additional description of the program and any additional requirements. Participation in our loyalty or other similar programs is voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. To withdraw from loyalty or other programs, please go to the [_Mattel Privacy Choice Portal_](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/3773efbf-1df1-4e6a-8d00-010aec40f536).

To the extent that we provide a program that may be considered a financial incentive because the program is directly or reasonably related the collection, deletion or sale or retention of consumer personal information, the value is reasonably related to the overall value we receive from the personal information participants provide specific to the program minus the costs and expenses we incur in providing the program.

When we rely on legitimate interests, we are taking on extra responsibility for considering and protecting individual’s rights and interests. We rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis where we use your data in ways you would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing. You can object to us doing so at any time.

We want to let you know that we have conducted balance tests to determine if we can process your personal data based on our legitimate interests. These tests analyze the potential impact on your rights and freedoms from our processing activities. Our findings are that the processing activities are proportionate and pose no harm to you. Our aim is to help you make informed purchasing decisions.

**International data transfers**

### **Personal information retention period**

The personal information processed will be kept for as long as the purpose for which they were collected is maintained.

However, when we request your consent or you have the possibility to object the processing activity, we will stop processing the personal information as soon as You withdraw your consent, or you object the processing activity.

That is to say, if you revoke your consent or exercise your objection right, your personal data will be kept during the legally established periods in order to attend to possible liabilities arising from the processing activities thereof. To this extent, your personal information shall be kept for the formulation, exercise or defense of potential claims, only if it allowed by the applicable legislation, or to make the personal information available to judges and courts or competent public authorities. At the end of this extra period, we undertake to cease processing all your personal data.
