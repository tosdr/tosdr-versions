#### [](#)**How We Disclose Your Personal Information**

We disclose information that we obtain within the Mattel family of companies, and with our third-party partners for them to fulfill their tasks on our behalf. In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, we disclose personal information in the following circumstances:

* **Affiliates and Acquisitions**. We may disclose personal information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control). If another company acquires, or plans to acquire, our company, business, or our assets, we will also disclose information with that company, including at the negotiation stage.
* **Direct Mail.** As is customary with catalogue businesses, we disclose certain names and mailing addresses (but not email addresses) of catalogue recipients with third parties whose catalogues may be of interest to you. Where required, we obtain your consent first. You can opt out at any time. We will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies if you contact us. Please visit our [Communication Preferences portal](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/1f32dee8-09ca-425b-b9d1-f78a1c2e219e).
* **Other Disclosures with Your Consent.** We may ask if you would like us to disclose your information with other unaffiliated third parties who offer products or services that may interest you.
* **Other Disclosures without Your Consent.** We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also disclose your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third party intermediary.
* **Partner Promotion**. We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions in partnership with third parties. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third party partner, the information that you provide will be disclosed with us and with them. Their use of your information is not governed by this Privacy Statement, unless a link to this Privacy Statement is presented when you enter, opt-in, or in the disclaimer or rules of the promotion. Please consult the privacy statement or policy that is presented on the entry or redemption page for the promotion for more information.
* **Service Providers**. We may disclose your information with a variety of service providers. Among other things service providers may help us to administer our website, provide database and server maintenance and security, conduct surveys, provide technical support, process payments, and assist in the fulfillment of orders. Our contracts with third-party service providers who access information require them to safeguard that information.
* **Social Networks**. If you provide social sign-on information to log in to a Mattel Service, Mattel Site, or third party services provided on any Mattel Service or Mattel Site, information is disclosed with your social network, such as the fact that you logged in to a Mattel Service or Mattel Site, or your activity on the Mattel Service or Mattel Site. We may send messages via the social network to communicate with you.
* **Third-Party Technology Partners.** We disclose information about usage and interests that we obtain through cookies and related technologies with third-party technology partners, and obtain consent as required by applicable law. Learn more at our [Cookies and Technology Statement](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/cookies-and-technologies).
* **User-generated Content**. Some of our Sites or Services may provide the opportunity to post or upload content, like reviews, comments, videos, pictures, or social media interactions. If you decide to submit information on these pages, that information may be publicly available to others using the service. Social sharing at Mattel Services directed to children are structured so that no children’s personal contact information is shared between visitors unless parental consent is obtained.

#### [](#)**How We Protect Your Personal Information**

We strive to protect the information you provide to us when you use our Mattel Services through commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards. Please be aware that while we work hard to protect your information, no method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that information security measures are failure proof.

We recommend that you learn about and use tools, habits, and practices to protect the security of your personal information.

#### [](#)**Transmission of Information to Other Countries**

The servers that make Mattel Services available, and databases where we house information may be located in the United States and in other countries that may have privacy laws that differ from where you live. We may use cloud services whose servers may be anywhere in the world.

* We take appropriate measures for the cross-border transfer of personal information, including the use of Standard Contractual Clauses or other mechanisms as required by applicable law. If you wish to obtain a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses, they can be found [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).
