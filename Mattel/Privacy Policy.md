If the survey is provided by a third party service provider, the third party’s privacy policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information. | We use this information to understand your opinions, and collect information relevant to our organization. We have a legitimate interest in collecting feedback. |
| Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions | When you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other similar campaign or promotion, we collect your name, contact information, and in some cases limited demographic information and content generated by participants. Some campaigns and promotions have a social networking component where you can choose to submit additional information such as social media profiles and handles, photographs, and other content. | We have a legitimate interest in administering our sweepstakes, contests, and other similar promotions. In some contexts, we are also required by law to collect information about those that enter into our sweepstakes. |
| Your Wishlists | When you curate a wish list of products in your online account, we collect information concerning products you may be interested in purchasing at a later date. | We use this information to save the products you may be interested in purchasing at a later date. We have a legitimate interest in providing account related functionalities to our users. |

In addition to the personal information we collect from you directly, we may also obtain information about you from other sources, including third parties, business partners, social networks, vendors that provide services on our behalf, or publicly available sources. For example, if you have given Mattel permission to store your credit card information and your credit card issuer provides an account updater service, we may receive updated credit card information (including credit card number and expiration date) from the credit card issuer.

In some cases, you are not required to provide all personal information identified in this Privacy Statement to use Mattel Services, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide certain personal information. For example, if you do not provide certain personal information, we may not be able to perform a transaction with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable, among other things.

#### [](#)**How We Use Your Personal Information**

In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we use personal information in the following ways:

* To provide you with Mattel Services.
* To identify you when you visit our websites or stores.
* To fulfill your requests, such as to provide you with products and services or to process returns.
* To communicate with you about your orders, subscriptions, as well as our products, services, sales, offers, and promotions.
* To verify your or your child’s age.
* To send marketing and advertising communications.
* To detect security incidents, and to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, including attempts to manipulate or violate our policies, procedures, and terms and conditions.
* To protect our intellectual property.
* To comply with legal obligations, to establish or exercise our rights, and to defend against a legal claim.
* To provide and maintain the functionality of our website, including identifying and repairing errors or problems.
* To support core business functions, including to maintain records related to business process management, loss and fraud prevention, and to collect amounts owing to us.

Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your personal information, in many situations we have more than one purpose. For example, if you complete an online purchase, we collect your information to perform our contract with you, but we also collect your information so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order after your transaction is complete.

#### [](#)**How We Disclose Your Personal Information**

We disclose information that we obtain within the Mattel family of companies, and with our third-party partners for them to fulfill their tasks on our behalf. In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, we disclose personal information in the following circumstances:

* **Affiliates and Acquisitions**. We may disclose personal information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control). If another company acquires, or plans to acquire, our company, business, or our assets, we will also disclose information with that company, including at the negotiation stage.
* **Direct Mail.** As is customary with catalogue businesses, we disclose certain names and mailing addresses (but not email addresses) of catalogue recipients with third parties whose catalogues may be of interest to you. Where required, we obtain your consent first. You can opt out at any time. We will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies if you contact us. Please visit our [Communication Preferences portal](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/1f32dee8-09ca-425b-b9d1-f78a1c2e219e).
* **Other Disclosures with Your Consent.** We may ask if you would like us to disclose your information with other unaffiliated third parties who offer products or services that may interest you.
* **Other Disclosures without Your Consent.** We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws. We may also disclose your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third party intermediary.
* **Partner Promotion**. We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions in partnership with third parties. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third party partner, the information that you provide will be disclosed with us and with them. Their use of your information is not governed by this Privacy Statement, unless a link to this Privacy Statement is presented when you enter, opt-in, or in the disclaimer or rules of the promotion. Please consult the privacy statement or policy that is presented on the entry or redemption page for the promotion for more information.
* **Service Providers**. We may disclose your information with a variety of service providers. Among other things service providers may help us to administer our website, provide database and server maintenance and security, conduct surveys, provide technical support, process payments, and assist in the fulfillment of orders. Our contracts with third-party service providers who access information require them to safeguard that information.
* **Social Networks**. If you provide social sign-on information to log in to a Mattel Service, Mattel Site, or third party services provided on any Mattel Service or Mattel Site, information is disclosed with your social network, such as the fact that you logged in to a Mattel Service or Mattel Site, or your activity on the Mattel Service or Mattel Site. We may send messages via the social network to communicate with you.
* **Third-Party Technology Partners.** We disclose information about usage and interests that we obtain through cookies and related technologies with third-party technology partners, and obtain consent as required by applicable law. Learn more at our [Cookies and Technology Statement](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/cookies-and-technologies).
* **User-generated Content**. Some of our Sites or Services may provide the opportunity to post or upload content, like reviews, comments, videos, pictures, or social media interactions. If you decide to submit information on these pages, that information may be publicly available to others using the service. Social sharing at Mattel Services directed to children are structured so that no children’s personal contact information is shared between visitors unless parental consent is obtained.

#### [](#)**How We Protect Your Personal Information**

We strive to protect the information you provide to us when you use our Mattel Services through commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards. Please be aware that while we work hard to protect your information, no method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that information security measures are failure proof.

We recommend that you learn about and use tools, habits, and practices to protect the security of your personal information.

#### [](#)**Transmission of Information to Other Countries**

The servers that make Mattel Services available, and databases where we house information may be located in the United States and in other countries that may have privacy laws that differ from where you live. We may use cloud services whose servers may be anywhere in the world.
