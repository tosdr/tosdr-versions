**Cookies and Technologies Statement**
======================================

Updated Dec 20, 2019

#### Overview:

  
This Cookies and Technologies Statement describes the technologies used in connection with [_Mattel Services._](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions) Key terms are italicized (_like this)_ and can be found in the [DEFINITIONS](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions) section of our Privacy Statement.

Mattel and its [_third-party partners_](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions), or [_third-party technology partners_](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions), may receive and store certain [_information_](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions) automatically when you use _Mattel Services._ This may include [_automatically collected information_](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions) and [_device information._](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions) This _information_ allows us to count the total number of “hits” on our Mattel Sites or installation and frequency of use of our apps, for example.

We collect certain _information_ using technology, like cookies and pixel tags. We may also use local stored objects (“LSOs”) in connection with Flash or HTML5 games or other content to store game and activity progress or to store bandwidth _information_ for the performance of the content.

_Third-party_ _technology partners_ also use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, clear GIFs, and other technology to collect certain information regarding use of _Mattel Services_ automatically. Advertising networks may use this _information_ to serve you targeted ads for products and services that, based on your activities, are likely to be of interest to you ([_“interest-based advertising”_](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions)). We or our _third-party technology partners_ may use this _information_ to provide personalized content or to deliver ads.

Other _third-party partners_, like social media sites, may also use cookies and similar technology to collect certain _information_ about your use of _Mattel Services_ through social media plug-ins. You may be able to provide [_social-sign on information_](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/privacy-statement#anchor-Definitions) to access a _Mattel Service_. If so, the social network may be able to link your activities in _Mattel Services_ to your social media registration _information._

#### Technology Lists and Controls

**Mattel Sites:**  
For a list of our major technology partners for our _Mattel Sites_, and the choices and controls they may offer about collection and use of _information_, read the [THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LIST](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt485dfa12bf05dba5/bltd15c49511e8547da/6491ae2cf7411bf3f837dbfd/Third_Party_Technology_List_June2023.pdf). For _Mattel Sites_ in the Unites States (except for our “play” sites designed for children), you may also visit the ADCHOICES tool located at the bottom of the Site to exercise choices regarding technology used on those Sites. For _Mattel Sites_ with visitors in other countries, such as countries in the European Economic Area, you may be presented with other tools to help you manage technology used on those _Mattel Sites_. Please also see the Additional Details section below for information regarding managing website technologies through browser settings and on managing Local shared objects (LSOs).

**Mobile Apps:**For a list of our major technology partners for our mobile apps, please see the [MOBILE THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY LIST](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt485dfa12bf05dba5/bltfe61149c65142808/63c80e87eaf215108cb67802/Mobile_Third_Party_Technology_List.pdf). You may be able to manage certain technologies using your built-in mobile device settings and controls, or the setting within your app where applicable. Please also see the Additional Details section below for more information regarding managing mobile app technologies through device settings.

Choices are browser- and/or device-specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices (computer, tablet, smart phone, etc.), your opt out choices will need to be re-set. You should check how to do this on your device(s) and operating systems.

For more details on the technologies we may use, _information_ that is collected, and how it is used, please continue reading the section below.

#### Additional Details

**Cookies:**  
A “cookie” is a small file that is saved on your computer or mobile device. Cookies help improve your user experience, and allow us to analyze _Mattel Services_, manage our advertising, and help serve _interest-based advertising_ related to _Mattel Services_ for adults and teens.

Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your pages and us to customize our offerings; and they help you to participate in some activities or events through _Mattel Services_. For instance, we may offer scavenger or treasure hunts, and we need to use cookies to keep track of your progress. In that case, if you leave our _Mattel Service_ and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over again. Cookies can also keep track of items in your shopping cart and wish list in our online stores and may be used to help you engage in other activities, like comparison shopping.

We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit _Mattel Services_, which of our web pages they go to and how long they stay there. This _information_ helps us figure out which of our web features are successes and what _Mattel Services_ might need improvement.

For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses. The IP address allows us to count the total number of “hits” on _Mattel Sites_. Your IP address and cookies are not connected to any _personal contact information_ unless you register with a _Mattel Service_ or order at our online stores; however, if you register, all _information_ we collect will be associated with your customer file.

Some _Mattel Services_ may use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests in our products when you visit other websites or areas of the internet.

You can set your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or turn off all cookies (except LSOs – see below) through your Internet browser (for example, Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Opera). Check your browser’s Help menu or your built-in mobile device settings to find out how. Some mobile devices store cookies not only in areas connected to the browser, but also in areas that are app-specific, so these cookies cannot be controlled by the browser settings. Check your app-setting options on your mobile device to find out how to manage or delete cookies that may be stored in these other areas.

Please note that if you do not accept cookies, some features or activities of _Mattel Services_ may not be available to you.

**Local Shared Objects, HTML5 and Flash Cookies**

Local shared objects (LSOs) are built for use with HTML5, Adobe® Flash® Player, and other content. LSOs act like cookies in that they store _information_ to provide you with a more customized experience, but LSOs can store complex data that cookies cannot, and LSOs are not deleted or rejected if you set your browser to delete or reject cookies. The _information_ stored in any LSO deployed by our Sites is not used to profile or track you online. Although browser settings will not allow you to manage LSOs, you may be able to manage them in other ways. To find out more about how to manage or delete LSOs, visit [https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html)

**Web Beacons, Pixel Tags or Clear Gifs**

We or _third-party technology partners_ may also use other technology, called web beacons, pixel tags or clear GIFs, to provide us with other important _information_, such as when an email has been opened, or to develop statistics on the effectiveness of advertising at our Sites. In some cases, working with _third-party partners_, _information_ is used to send advertisements for our products based on your interests.

**Apps**

When downloading an app (or using an app that relies on online features made available through your mobile platform), the app store will collect certain device and app-related _information_. Mattel does not control the data collection or privacy practices of the app stores. You should review the privacy policy and terms of use of any app store before downloading or using any app and review and use available controls and settings on your device to reflect your preferences.

**Location Information**

For some _Mattel Services_, we or our _third-party_ _technology partners_ may collect [_location information_](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html), including location _information_ provided either by a mobile device interacting with one of our apps or associated with your IP address or Wi-Fi network. These features might enable you to engage in activities like finding a nearby store, playing certain games, or connecting an internet-enabled product to a Wi-Fi network, for example. You can generally limit or prohibit the collection of _location information_ by using the built-in settings on your mobile device. Check your device instructions or online manual/FAQs for _information_ on how to do so. You will typically be notified if the app or _Mattel Service_ collects _location information_ and be given a chance to consent. We do not permit collection of precise location information (actual address) in mobile apps without your consent. _Child_\-directed apps do not collect precise (street-level) location information.

**Analytics**

We or our agents and service partners may use cookies, web beacons and other technology to analyze the effectiveness of _Mattel Services_. This typically involves collecting your IP address or UDID and _information_ on your activities, like the _Mattel Sites_ you visit or frequency of use of an app. We strive to work with providers that adhere to applicable self-regulatory standards. You may be able to opt out of data collection or use by some third-party analytics companies who work with us.

**Targeted Advertising**

Mattel may work with third-party online or mobile network advertisers that use cookies, pixels, transparent GIF files, or other non-cookie technology to help us manage advertising at our _Mattel Sites_ or apps and measure its effectiveness. This includes our collector _Mattel Sites_ and online stores, or _Mattel Services_ directed to adults and teens. These technologies enable third-party ad networks to recognize a unique cookie on your computer, tablet or mobile device and may be placed by us, our network advertising firm(s), or by another advertiser that works with our third-party network advertiser(s). The _information_ that is collected and shared in this fashion does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. However, it is linked to the device identifier of the device you are using to keep track of all the sites you have visited that are associated with the ad network. This _information_ may be used for the purpose of targeting advertisements on Mattel Services and third-party sites or services based on those interests, and to learn which ads bring users to _Mattel Services_. **Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, and browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on non-cookie technologies.**

We support the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) as well as the self-regulatory program of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). As part of this service, our online advertisements and Sites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control. For more information about our network advertisers, including information on choices they may offer you to opt out of technologies that they control, please follow the directions on the AdChoices icon within any interest-or behavior-based advertisement. Services directed to adults and teens that engage in interest-based advertising may also include the AdChoices icon on the home page. Websites operated by the [NETWORK ADVERTISING INITIATIVE](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F) and [DIGITAL ADVERTISING ALLIANCE](https://optout.aboutads.info/?lang=EN&c=2#!%2F) (for the U.S.) and the [EUROPEAN DIGITAL ADVERTISING](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (for the European Economic Area (EEA)) offer opt-out tools for those participating in those programs. Participating network advertisers will be listed at those sites. Some third parties may offer opt out tools on their own sites. Consult their privacy statements for more details.

Keep in mind that, if you opt out of interest-based advertising on our _Mattel Sites_, you may still see customized advertising displayed by advertising networks from which you have not opted out. In addition, your opt out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. Please also note that you will need to make such choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our _Sites._

Similarly, if you opt out of interest-based advertising on our Mobile Apps, your opt will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you. Please also note that you may need to revisit such choices if you reset your phone or otherwise turn ad tracking back on in your device settings.

**Social Media Platforms and Plugins**

If you are a member of a social media network, like Facebook, a cookie may be sent to that network when you access a page of _Mattel Services_ that links to their website through a plugin (such as Facebook’s “Like” or Google “+1” buttons), register or log into your account at their platform, or use your social media user name and password to log into _Mattel Services_ where you have the option to do so. That may enable them and us to link your activities with your personal registration information at their site and may include notifying your friends or connections about your activities in Mattel Services, and using tracking technologies to monitor your online activities to serve targeted ads. The social media networks’ privacy policy and terms apply to your use of their platforms. Your browser or device may allow you to block these technologies, but you should visit the third-party website and review their privacy policy and your registration profile or account to find out your options.
