Your use of the Platform after posting the updated version shall mean your acceptance of the updated Agreement. In case you use a corporate account, only the administrator of that corporate account will be notified. The administrator of the corporate account and not Smartcat is solely responsible for further notification of changes to other members of the corporate account.

Once you complete the mandatory fields of your profile to register as a Customer and accept this Customer Agreement, you represent and warrant to Smartcat that: (i) you are authorized to bind yourself; (ii) you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service, located at [www.smartcat.com/terms/](http://www.smartcat.com/terms/) (“TOS”); and (iii) you agree to be considered a Customer.

[](#)

### 2\. **SERVICES**

[**Back to top**](#terms-block)

2.1. During the term of this Agreement, Smartcat shall provide the Client with the Translation Services as described in each Service Task and the Subscription Services as described in the Order Forms.

2.2. Smartcat hereby grants to the Client a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Services for the Client’s internal business purposes and under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.3 **Delivery of Translated Works; Acceptance.**

(a) If the Customer opts to utilize Smartcat's Translation Services, the Translated Works shall undergo a review process by the Customer to assess the quality of the Translated Works. Smartcat will submit Translated Works to the Customer for Customer’s review (the “Acceptance Review”). The Customer will complete its Acceptance Review within 15 (fifteen) calendar days unless another period is agreed upon by the Parties (the “Review Period”). Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Customer shall provide Smartcat with notice through the Customer’s account dashboard on the Platform of the Customer’s Acceptance of the Translated Works by clicking “done” or “accept” (the “Acceptance”) or of the Translated Works’ failure to meet standard industry practices (the “Rejection”), provided however, that failure by the Customer to deliver any notice in accordance with this par. 2.3(a) during the Review Period, will constitute automatic Acceptance of the Translated Works by the Customer. Acceptance generates an obligation of the Customer to pay for the Translation Services. Failure by Smartcat to deliver Translated Works to Customer within the timeframe identified in the applicable Service Task may constitute cause for a Rejection of such Translated Works by Customer.

(b) Smartcat provides a quality guarantee to the Translated Works except for the translation performed by Subcontractors (as defined herein) mentioned in par. 2.4(c) and Subcontractors not suggested by Smartcat for performing a specific Service Task.

(c) The quality guarantee means that subject to par 2.3(b):

1) In the event of a Rejection by the Customer within the Review Period, Smartcat will, at the option of the Customer, either: (i) use reasonable commercial efforts to correct and remedy the failure(s) or deficiency(ies) identified by the Customer (using the same or another Subcontractor in Customer’s discretion), or (ii) negotiate with the Customer in good faith a discount to the fees for the Translation Services related to the Translated Works which were the subject of a Rejection. For a Rejection resulting solely from a delay in delivery, the maximum discount that Smartcat will offer will be capped at 15%.

2) In the event that the Customer accepts the Translated Works but subsequently discovers that the Translated Works fail to meet standard industry practices, Smartcat will, at the option of the Customer, either: (i) use reasonable commercial efforts to correct and remedy the failure(s) or deficiency(ies) identified by the Customer (using the same or another Subcontractor in Customer’s discretion), or (ii) negotiate with the Customer in good faith a discount to the fees for the subsequent Translation Services.

(d) Smartcat’s obligations under par. 2.3(c) comprise Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and Smartcat’s sole obligation and liability for failure to meet standard industry practices.

2.4 **Subcontractors.**

(a) Smartcat shall be wholly responsible for payment to the Subcontractors of their fees in connection with performing the Translation Services except for Subcontractors mentioned in par. 2.4(c).

(b) The Customer may request that Smartcat either (i) use, replace or assign additional Subcontractors to a Service Task or (ii) not use or remove specific Subcontractors from a Service Task, and Smartcat will use reasonable commercial efforts to accommodate Customer requests.

(c) The Customer may invite Subcontractors to register on the Platform via an invitation link. Smartcat does not provide any additional services to such Subcontractors (including without limitation listing Subcontractor’s profile on the Platform search) except those services that are required to establish and maintain efficient collaboration and delivery of the results of the Service Task. For the avoidance of doubt, Subcontractors are considered to be invited by the Customer if: (i) such Subcontractor’s account was not viewed on the Platform by the Customer prior to invitation (ii) the Subcontractor’s account on the Platform was registered by the invitation link generated from Customer’s account dashboard with the Platform.

(d) The Customer agrees, during the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter, not to solicit any Subcontractors (except for Subcontractors invited by the Customer as per par.2.4(c) above) for employment or consulting, directly or indirectly, for the Customer or for any business or organization in which the Customer, or any of the beneficial owners of the Customer, if the Customer is a legal entity, has an ownership interest of any kind. Provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to any Subcontractor who (i) responds to a general mass solicitation of employment or independent contracting not specifically directed towards Subcontractors of Smartcat (including without limitation the use of independent employment agencies and advertisements in publications or via the internet), (ii) is independently referred to the Customer by a recruitment firm retained to make a general solicitation of employment or independent contracting. In no event shall Subcontractors be considered employees of the Customer. The Customer agrees not to use the Platform for assigning Service Tasks or performing Service Tasks with Subcontractors with whom the Customer has an employer-employee relationship.

2.5 **Delays.** In the event of (a) a delay by the Customer in delivering the Customer Materials or responding to questions relating to the Customer Materials, (b) a delay due to the Customer’s request for changes to the Customer Materials or any other terms of the applicable Service Task, (c) a dispute in good faith between the parties as to whether the Translated Works meet the requirements specified in the applicable Service Task, (d) a delay due to any third party’s act, failure to act or delay in performing any obligation whatsoever, other than the act, failure to act or delay by a Subcontractor, or (e) any other delay incurred as a result of Customer’s actions, the delivery schedule set forth in the Service Task shall be deemed postponed for an equivalent period. No such delay shall relieve or suspend Customer’s obligation to pay Smartcat under par. 3 hereof and, in addition to such payment obligations, the Customer shall pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by Smartcat in connection with and as a direct result of any such delay.
