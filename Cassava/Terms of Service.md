Terms of Service
================

_Last updated: October 27, 2024_
--------------------------------

Thank you for using Cassava!

When we say "company", "we", "our, "us", "Cassava", "application", "bot", "service" or "services" in this document, we are referring to Cassavarose LLC.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with Cassava.

When we say "platform" in this document, we are referring to your integration wtih Cassava which includes Slack and Microsoft Teams.

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our [company blog](https://gocassava.com/blog) and/or the dashboard.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. **These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about [who we are](https://gocassava.com/about), and keeping an open mind to your feedback.

Account Terms
=============

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. Cassava cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account (even by others who have their own logins under your account).

You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

You must go through the OAuth handshake with your platform (Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Webex) in order to complete our registration process. In the case of Microsoft Teams you can install our app directly via the App directory without invoking OAuth. Email based registration is also possible via a Magic Link.

You must be a human. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are not permitted.

You must be 18 years or older and have the legal authority to enter into these Terms.

Payment, refunds, upgrading and downgrading terms
=================================================

When you register with Cassava, you are automatically enrolled in our free plan. We do not ask for your credit card and we do not sell your data. Accounts on the free plan with extended periods of no publishing activity are subject to closure at our discretion.

At anytime you may choose to upgrade from the free plan to a paid one. When you do so directly on Cassava, we will request your credit card and other billing information and charge you immediately. Your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade and recurrs monthly. Payments are made via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). You can refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://gocassava.com/privacy) for more information. Subscriptions which are purchased via our external partner platforms are managed therein.

For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle and the change is prorated. Downgrading your plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account. Cassava does not accept any liability for such loss.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.

Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. The subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each term for a term of equal length, without prior notice, unless and until canceled by you, or it is terminated by us. The subscription must be canceled before it renews to avoid billing of the next term’s subscription fees.  
  
For those who transact via the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace you can find more information at [Refund policies for Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/refund-policies).

Paid Subscription Cancellation
==============================

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email to cancel your account is not considered cancellation of a paid subscription. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account under your Billing Information section of the website. We provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation button.

If you cancel your subscription before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again. Your access remains as is until the end of the current billing cycle. No partial refunds are given.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Account Deletion and Termination
================================

As an admin, you can delete your account and all your data at any time. A 7-day grace period exists, during which all administrators are notified of the intended action and can contact customer support to cancel the request if it was a mistake. The deletion is finalized at the end of the grace period.

All training programs, media assets, and other personal information are permanently deleted from our database and AWS storage. Data in our managed database backups can persist from 7 to 30 days. We may retain information about purchases, records showing that we deleted your account, aggregated analytics, as well as data in an active legal case.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the service for any reason at any time. Such termination of the service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account and site stats. Cassava reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any service customer, company employee or officer may result in immediate account termination.

Modifications to the service and prices
=======================================

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the service with or without notice.

Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via your contact information on record. We may also post a notice about changes within the product itself and to our blog.

Cassava shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the service.

You are solely responsible for any content and other material that you submit, publish, transmit, email, or display on, through, or with the service. All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright law.

We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the service. All site data remains yours.

We do not pre-screen content (with exception to blog comments), but reserve the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.

You may provide us with feedback, suggestions, and ideas about the service. You agree that we own all rights to use and incorporate the feedback you provide in any way, including in future enhancements and modifications to the service, without payment or attribution to you.

You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with Cassava. The look and feel of the service is copyright© to Cassava. All rights reserved. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the service, use of the service, or access to the service without the express written permission by the company.

General conditions
==================

Your use of Cassava is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do take uptime of our application seriously.

We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.

We design our services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free services.

Technical support is provided by email. Email responses are provided on the reasonable effort basis without guaranteed response time.

We can access your data to help you with support requests you make and to maintain and safeguard Cassava to ensure the security of your data and the service as a whole.

We use third party vendors to provide the necessary hardware, storage, payment processing and related technology required to run the Services. See our Privacy Policy for more information.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Liability
=========

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

**You expressly understand and agree that Cassava shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.**

In other words: choosing to use our services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our services, thank you for betting on us.

This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States, and the courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all issues that may arise under or in relation to this agreement.
