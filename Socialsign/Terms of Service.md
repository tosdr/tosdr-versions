##### Schedule A - SocialSign.in's Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP")

SocialSign.in respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information, however, when there are competing interests at issue, SocialSign.in reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, SocialSign.in has developed this AUP, which supplements and explains certain terms in the Agreement and is intended as a guide to your rights and obligations when utilizing the Services and the Website. This AUP will be revised from time to time, without any obligation to notify you of the same. Your use of the Services after changes to this AUP are posted on the Website shall constitute your acceptance of any new or additional terms.

One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use the Internet, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others. When you obtain information through the Internet via the Services, you must keep in mind that we cannot, and do not make any attempt to, monitor, verify, warrant, or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information that you may acquire. For this reason, you must exercise your best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet is sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because we cannot monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, neither SocialSign.in nor any applicable Venue shall be responsible for injury to you that results from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive, or illegal Internet communications.

When you disseminate information through the Internet via the Services, you must keep in mind that SocialSign.in does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information you may create. When you place information on the Internet, you have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech. Also, because the information you create is carried over our and the Venues' networks and may reach a large number of people, your postings may affect other subscribers and may harm our goodwill, business reputation, and operations. For these reasons, you violate this AUP and the Agreement when you engage in or facilitate the following prohibited activities:

##### 1\. Intellectual Property Violations

Using the Services to engage in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, or privacy or publicity rights held by individuals, corporations, or other entities. We are required by law to remove or block access to user content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement. It is also our policy to terminate the privileges of users who violate copyright laws.

##### 2\. Obscene Speech or Materials

Using the Services to view, advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material. We are required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when we become aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through the Services.

##### 3\. Defamatory or Abusive Language

Using the Services as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language.

##### 4\. Spamming

Using the Services to send unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages over the Internet (known as "spamming"). Spamming is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward SocialSign.in, but also because it can overload our and the Venues' networks and disrupt service to our other users. When a complaint is received, we have the discretion to determine from all of the evidence whether the email recipients were from an "opt-in" email list.

##### 5\. Forging of Headers

Using the Services to forge or misrepresent message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message.

##### 6\. Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks

Using the Services to access illegally or without authorization computers, accounts, or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individual's system (often known as "hacking"). Also, any activity that might be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e. port scan, stealth scan, or other information gathering activity).

##### 7\. Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities.

Using the Services to distribute information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mailbombing, or denial of service attacks.

##### 8\. Export Control Violations.

Using the Services to export encryption software over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States.

##### 9\. Other Activities.

Using the Services to engage in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that SocialSign.in determines to be harmful to our or the Venues' subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill, or customer relations.

As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just described rests primarily with you. We will not monitor the communications of our users to ensure that they comply with the Agreement, this AUP, or applicable law. However, if we become aware of harmful activities, we may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a website, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet or a particular website, or taking any other action that we deem appropriate.

We are also concerned with the privacy of on-line communications and websites. In general, the Internet is neither more nor less secure than other means of communication, including mail, facsimile, and voice telephone service, all of which can be intercepted and otherwise compromised. As a matter of prudence, however, we urge you to assume that all of your on-line communications are insecure. We cannot take any responsibility for the security of information transmitted over our or the Venues' networks, equipment, or facilities.

We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying your obligations as responsible members of the Internet. Any complaints about a user's violation of this AUP should be sent to [support@socialsign.in](mailto:support@socialsign.in)
