Website Terms

Certn Holdings Inc., including its affiliates Certn (Canada) Inc., Certn (USA) Inc. and any other wholly owned subsidiaries (“**Certn**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) provides the content and services available on this website (the “**Website**”). Except as otherwise provided herein, these website terms (the “**Terms**”) shall govern your access to and use of the services, including features and content available on this Website and other websites offered by Certn, its affiliates and partners, including but not limited to: obtaining, delivering, and managing background reports and related documentation; obtaining status information regarding background reports; Certn’s processes for generating background reports and resolving potential inaccuracies; requesting a copy of your consumer file; and/or any disputes relating to your background check (collectively, the “**Services**”). Your access to, review of, and/or use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.  

General

1. By accessing the Website and/or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our [](https://get.chekyourself.co/termsofuse/clkn/https/certn.co/privacy-policy/)Privacy Policy, as well as any additional service terms governing your use of a particular Service, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The provisions contained in these Terms are in addition to, and do not override, any service agreement signed by related to the Services (the “**Services Agreement**”). **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE WEBSITE.**
2. You must be 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, in order to generate a background check or use the Services. This Website is not directed to children under 13 years old. If you are under 13 years old, you may not provide personal information to us, make a purchase on the Website, or register on the Website.
3. Certn may revise the Terms at any time without notice to you. The revised Terms will be effective when posted to the Website. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Certn will provide notice of any revisions that may substantively impact or restrict your use of the Website and/or Services.
4. These Terms apply to any and all Certn customers and users of Certn’s Services, including but not limited to individuals, small and large businesses, and nonprofit organizations, who utilize the Services, as well as all others who access the Services, including but not limited to website visitors and users of affiliate websites which allow access to Certn’s Services (“**Customers**” “**Users**,” “**you**,” or “**your**”) including each User’s heirs, assigns and successors. If you use the Services on behalf of a business entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, your acceptance of the Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that entity, and “you” and “your” herein shall refer to that entity.
5. Subject to the age restrictions outlined above, you may be able to submit information to us through your use of the Services. You agree to provide us with accurate information about yourself, including any information you may submit for background checks conducted about or requested by you. You further agree that your submission of such information is subject to our Privacy Policy.
6. To the extent these Terms conflict with your Services Agreement, the Services Agreement governs. If you enter into an agreement with Certn providing different or additional terms regarding the Services and there is a conflict between a provision in these Terms and a provision in such agreement, the latter takes precedence with respect to the provision in conflict.

4. **HOW IS THIS POLICY UPDATED?**

We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time. All Website Visitors are encouraged to periodically review this Policy to stay informed of updates. Your continued use of our Website and Services following the posting of changes to this Policy will mean you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new revised Policy.

5. **WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, WHY, HOW AND FROM WHOM?**

**Legal Basis for Processing**

We Process your Personal Information (i) to provide our Services, (ii) to communicate with you, (iii) for security and fraud prevention, and (iv) to comply with the law. We may also use Personal Information for other purposes, subject to your consent. We will not Process your Personal Information unless we have the legal right to do so.

To Process your Personal Information lawfully, we rely on at least one legal basis as set forth by applicable law. Depending on your relationship with us, the legal basis to Process your Personal Information may include, among other things, your consent, the requirement to Process data for the performance of a contract with you, to comply with a legal obligation, or on the basis of legitimate interest.

If our legal basis for collecting and using Personal Information is your consent, you can withdraw or modify your consent for future collection or use of your Personal Information at any time, and we will explain the consequences of doing so. If we use your Personal Information for sales or marketing purposes, you can ask us to stop at any time and we will do so.

**Permissible Purpose for Processing**

Our Clients must certify that they have a Permissible Purpose before we can Process Personal Information for the purposes of providing the Services. “Permissible Purpose” includes employment purposes, tenancy purposes or in accordance with the written instructions of the Consumer with whom the Client intends to contract with.

We will not reuse Personal Information for any other purpose other than the one for which it was collected, unless one or more of the following is true:

* the new use is compatible with the original one, meaning you should reasonably expect it;
* we have notified you of the new use and given you an opportunity to object to it; or
* the new use is otherwise permitted or required by law.

We collect, use, and disclose Consumer Personal Information when the Consumer is aware of the Permissible Purpose for which the information will be Processed, and has given his or her consent to such Processing, except where the Processing of Personal Information without consent is permitted or required by law. Subject to regulatory requirements, operating our Services in certain jurisdictions requires us or our Clients to obtain additional or specific consents in the form of additional consent form/s, telephone call/s, through an online platform or other methods. Where the Consumer does not provide such consent or specific consent directly to us, but to our Clients, we require our Clients to obtain the Consumer’s consent prior to providing us with the Consumer’s Personal Information subject to verification for any of our Services. The Consumer may withdraw such consent previously granted at any time by contacting us. Withdrawing such consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing based on the consent before the withdrawal.

**What Information do we Process?**

4. **General.**

1. Each Party shall comply with all Applicable Laws with respect of its handling of Personal Information and undertakes to use best efforts to assist the other in each Party’s compliance with any obligations under Applicable Laws and shall not perform its obligations under this DPA in such a manner as to cause the other Party to breach any of its obligations under Applicable Laws to the extent it is aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, that the same would be a breach of such obligations.
2. Certn shall process Personal Information only on documented instructions from the Client in accordance with the Processing Purpose, unless required to do so by the Applicable Laws. Subsequent instructions may also be given by the Client throughout the duration of the Processing of Personal Information. Such instructions shall always be documented.
3. Certn shall immediately inform the Client if Certn believes that the instructions given by the Client (or Controller) infringe Applicable Laws.

6. **Purpose limitation.** Certn shall only process the Personal Information for the Processing Purpose, to the extent, and in such a manner, as is necessary for the performance of the Services. Certn will not process the Personal Information for any other purpose or in a way that does not comply with the Agreement (including this Schedule) or Applicable Laws.
7. **Erasure or return of Personal Information.**

1. Certn shall only Process the Personal Information provided by the Client during the Term of the Agreement.
2. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, the provisions in Annex I.B shall apply in relation to the data retention and erasure schedules.

9. **Security of Processing.**

1. Certn shall maintain commercially reasonable standards to ensure the security of the Personal Information, including protection against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to that data (personal data breach). A copy of Certn’s technical and organizational measures are set out in Annex II. If the Processing involves Personal Information revealing sensitive or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences, Certn shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards as reasonably required by the Client from time to time.
2. In assessing the appropriate level of security, both Parties shall take due account of the risks involved in the Processing, the nature of the Personal Information and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing.
3. In the event of a Personal Information breach, either Party shall notify the other without undue delay, and at the latest within 24 hours, after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information concerning the Personal Information breach can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and insofar as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall be provided as it becomes available without undue delay.

11. **Consumer rights.** Certn shall promptly notify the Client if it receives a Data Subject Access Request. Client shall be responsible for responding to Data Subject Access Requests and, however, to the extent the Client, does not have the ability to address a Data Subject Access Request, Certn, shall, where required by law or upon the Client’s request, provide reasonable efforts to assist the Client in responding to such Data Subject Access Request without additional costs during the timeframe of the Applicable Law.
12. **Subprocessors.**

1. Certn’s Sub-processors (found [here](https://trust.certn.co/)) shall be the entities engaged by Certn who agree to receive Personal Information from the Processor exclusively for Processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the Client’s instructions. The Client acknowledges and agrees that Certn’s Affiliates (a) may be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) may each engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services. Certn may remove, replace, or appoint suitable and reliable further Sub-processors, with notice to the Client, at its own discretion.
2. Notwithstanding the above, Client may reasonably object to Certn’s use of a new Sub-processor, for reasons relating to the protection of Personal Information intended to be Processed by such Sub-processor, by notifying Certn promptly in writing within three (3) business days after receipt of Certn’s notice. Such written objection shall include those reasons for objecting to Processor’s use of such a new Sub-processor. Failure to object to such a new Sub-processor in writing within three (3) business days following Certn’s notice shall be deemed as acceptance of the new Sub-Processor. In the event the Client reasonably objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted above, Certn may:

1. stop using the Sub-processor with regard to the Personal Information submitted by the Client;
2. take the corrective steps as requested by the Client in its objection;
3. cease to provide (temporarily or permanently) the particular aspect of the Service that would involve the use of such Sub-processor with regard to the Personal Information submitted by the Client; and
4. provide Client with a written description of commercially reasonable alternative(s), if any, to such engagement, including without limitation modification to the Services.

4. If Certn, in its sole discretion, cannot provide any alternative(s) listed above, or if the Client does not agree to any such alternative(s) if provided, Certn and the Client may terminate the Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Termination shall not relieve Client of any fees owed to Certn under the Agreement. Until a decision is made regarding the new Sub-processor, Certn may, where necessary, temporarily suspend the Processing of the affected Personal Information and/or suspend access to the account and Client will have no further claims against Processor due to the temporary suspension or the termination of the Agreement (including, without limitation, requesting refunds).
5. Certn shall ensure that all authorized Sub-processors have executed confidentiality agreements that prevent them from unauthorized Processing of Client Personal Information both during and after their engagement by Certn. In addition, Certn shall, (e.g., by way of contract or other legal act) impose on the Sub-processor the same data protection obligations as set out in this DPA.

14. **International Data transfers.**

1. **International data transfers subject to the SCCs.** Where the transfer of Personal Information is made subject to the SCCs, the “data importer” thereunder shall be either the Processor or its Sub-processor, as the case may be and as determined by Processor, and the “data exporter” shall be the Controller of such Personal Information. The Processor shall ensure that the relevant Sub-processor shall (where applicable) comply with the data importer’s obligations, and the Controller shall comply with the data exporter obligations, in each case under the applicable SCCs.
2. **International data transfers from and to countries that offer adequate level of data protection.** Personal Information may be transferred from EU Member States and the EEA member countries (Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland) (collectively, “EEA”) to countries that offer an adequate level of data protection (including Canada) under or pursuant to the adequacy decisions published by the relevant data protection authorities of the EEA or the European Commission (“Adequacy Decisions”), as relevant and applicable , without any further safeguard being necessary.
3. **Transfers from Switzerland.** To the extent that the Swiss Supervisory Authority considers the SCCs to provide appropriate safeguards for the purposes of transferring Personal Information and the data of legal entities, the following amendments shall apply in relation to Swiss transfers: (i) the Parties adopt the GDPR standard for all data transfers; (ii) in relation to Clause 13a, the EU Supervisory Authority shall be competent insofar as the data transfer is governed by the GDPR and the Swiss Supervisory Authority (FDPIC) shall conduct parallel supervision as applicable; and (iii) in relation to Clause 18 c, the term ’member state’ shall be interpreted in such a way as to allow data subjects in Switzerland with the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland).
4. **Transfers from the United Kingdom.** To the extent that the UK Supervisory Authority (the Information Commissioner) considers the SCCs to provide appropriate safeguards for the purposes of transferring Personal Information to a third country or an international organisation in reliance on Articles 46 of the UK GDPR and, with respect to data transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, the following amendments shall apply in relation to UK transfers:
    1. “The details of the transfers(s) and in particular the categories of Personal Information that are transferred and the purpose(s) for which they are transferred) are those specified in Annex I.B where UK Data Protection Laws apply to the data exporter’s processing when making that transfer.”
    2. References to “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” or “that Regulation” are replaced by “UK Data Protection Laws” and references to specific Article(s) of “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” are replaced with the equivalent Article or Section of UK Data Protection Laws. In particular:

1. References to Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are removed;
2. References to the “Union”, “EU” and “EU Member State” are all replaced with the “UK”;
3. Clause 13(a) is not used and the “competent supervisory authority” is the Information Commissioner;
4. Clause 17 is replaced to state “These SCCs are governed by the laws of England and Wales”;
5. Clause 18 is replaced to state: “Any dispute arising from these SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of England and Wales. A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of any country in the UK. The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.”; and
6. The footnotes to the SCCs do not apply to UK transfers.

16. **Miscellaneous.** Data Controller shall not unreasonably withhold or delay agreement to any consequential variations to this DPA proposed by Data Processor to protect the Data Processor against additional risks associated. If Data Controller proposes any other variations to this DPA which Data Controller reasonably considers to be necessary to address the requirements of Applicable laws, the Parties shall promptly discuss the proposed variations and negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing and implementing those or alternative variations as soon as is reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon notice to the Client, Certn may revise this Addendum so as to incorporate any mandatory SCCs or other terms that are required by any competent data protection authority in the EU or the UK

A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act

The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.

∙ You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment – or to take another adverse action against you – must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.

∙ You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your “file disclosure”). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:

o a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;

o you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file;

o your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud;

o you are on public assistance;

o you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.

In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) for additional information.

∙ You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.

∙ You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) for an explanation of dispute procedures.

∙ Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.

∙ Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.

∙ Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need – usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.

∙ You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore)

∙ You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address form the lists these offers are based on. You may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).

∙ The following FCRA right applies with respect to nationwide consumer reporting agencies :

  

CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN A SECURITY FREEZE

You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.

As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.

A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.

∙ You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.

∙ Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore)

  

States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws. In some cases, you may have more rights under state law.

**NOTICE REGARDING BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION**

**PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA LAW**

**(For California Applicants and Employees Only)**

  

**{{{company\_name}}}** ("the Company") intends to obtain information about you from an investigative consumer reporting agency for employment purposes. Thus, you can expect to be the subject of "investigative consumer reports" obtained for employment purposes. Such reports may include information about your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living. With respect to any investigative consumer report from an investigative consumer reporting agency ("ICRA"), the Company may investigate the information contained in your employment application and other background information about you, including but not limited to: your social security number and identification documents, criminal history, sex offender registry status, credit history, employment history, education history, driving history, professional licenses, drug testing results. The Company may also obtain comments from individuals who are knowledgeable about you . These reports may be used as a factor in making employment decisions. The source of any investigative consumer report (as that term is defined under California law) will be Certn (USA) Inc., 3820 Central Avenue #220, Cheyenne, WY 82001, 844-987-0690. Information regarding Certn's privacy practices (including information about whether any consumer personal information will be sent outside the U.S. or its territories) may be found at https: // certn . co / .

Under California Civil Code section 1786.22, you are entitled to find out from an ICRA what is in the ICRA's file on you with proper identification, as follows:

  

In person, by visual inspection of your file during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. You also may request a copy of the information in person. The ICRA may not charge you more than the actual copying costs for providing you with a copy of your file.

* By requesting a copy be sent to a specified addressee by certified mail. ICRAs complying with requests for certified mailings shall not be liable for disclosures to third parties caused by mishandling of mail after such mailings leave the ICRAs.

A summary of all information contained in the ICRA's file on you (which is required to be provided

by the California Civil Code) will be provided to you via telephone, if you have made a written request for telephone disclosure and the toll charge, if any, for the telephone call is prepaid by or charged directly to you.

"Proper Identification" includes documents such as a valid driver's license, social security account number, military identification card, and credit cards. Only if you cannot identify yourself with such information may the ICRA require additional information concerning your employment and personal or family history in order to verify your identity.

The ICRA will provide trained personnel to explain any information furnished to you and will provide a written explanation of any coded information contained in files maintained on you. This written explanation will be provided whenever a file is provided to you for visual inspection.

  

You may be accompanied by one other person of your choosing, who must furnish reasonable identification. An ICRA may require you to furnish a written statement granting permission to the ICRA to discuss your file in such person's presence.

**A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE NEW JERSEY FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT**

The state of New Jersey Fair Credit Reporting Act (NJFCRA) is designed to promote accuracy, fairness, consumer confidentiality and the proper use of credit data by each consumer reporting agency (“CRA”) in accordance with the requirements of the NJFCRA.

Under the NJFCRA an employer, before taking adverse employment action, is required to provide the applicant or employee with a summary of their rights under the NJFCRA with respect to consumer reports or investigative consumer reports obtained for employment purposes from a consumer reporting agency (CRA).

You can find the complete text of the NJCRA, N.J. Stat. §§56:11‐29‐ 56:11‐41, at the New Jersey State Legislature's web site ([http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/)). You may have additional rights under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681‐1681u, which is available on the Internet at the Federal Trade Commission’s website ([http://www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/)).

* You must consent to the procurement for employment purposes of a report about you. Before an employer can obtain a report about you from a CRA, the employer must provide you with notice that it will request the report and obtain your consent to that request. A CRA may not give out information about you to your employer, or prospective employer, without your written consent.
* You must be told if information in your file has been used against you for employment purposes. An employer who uses information from a consumer or investigative consumer report to take action against you – such as denying an application for employment or terminating employment – must tell you that its decision is based in whole or in part on the report. The employer also must provide you with a description of your rights under the NJCRA and a reasonable opportunity to dispute with the CRA any information on which the employer relied.
* You can find out what is in your file. At your request, a CRA must give you the information in your file and a list of everyone who has recently requested your file. These disclosures may be made in person, over the telephone or by any other reasonable method available to the CRA.
* You can dispute inaccurate information with the CRA. If you tell a CRA that your file contains inaccurate information, the CRA must reinvestigate the disputed items, free of charge, within 30 days, unless the CRA determines that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. The CRA must give you a written report of the investigation. If the CRA's investigation does not resolve the dispute, you may add a brief statement to your file. If an item is deleted or a dispute statement is filed, you may ask that anyone who has recently received your report be notified of the change.
* Inaccurate information must be corrected or deleted. A CRA must remove or correct inaccurate or unverified information from its files within 30 days after you dispute it. If your dispute results in any change to your report, the CRA cannot reinsert into your file a disputed item unless the information source verifies its accuracy and completeness. In addition, the CRA must give you a written notice telling you it has reinserted the item. The notice must include the business name and address.
* You may seek damages from violators. If a CRA, a user or (in some cases) a provider of CRA data violates the NJFCRA, you may sue them in state court.

**STATE OF WASHINGTON**

**CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING ACT**

**SUMMARY OF CONSUMER RIGHTS**

  

The State of Washington Fair Credit Reporting Act (WFCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records).

Here is a summary of your major rights under the WFCRA. The WFCRA is modeled after the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. The same rights are provided under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and you have received A Summary of Your Rights Under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. You can get the complete text of WFCRA RCW 19.182, from the Washington Code Revisers Office, P.O. Box 40551, Olympia, WA, 98504, or online at [http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.182&full=true#19.182.070](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.182&full=true#19.182.070).

* Under Washington law, we must convey your dispute to the source of the information within five business days after receiving your request for investigation. If we determine that the request is frivolous or irrelevant as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we will notify you within five business days of the reasons for our decision. The results of our investigation will be sent to you within five business days after the investigation is complete. If you request, we will provide you with the company name, address and telephone number of any person contacted during the investigation. If you believe that a law regulating consumer credit reporting has been violated, you may file a complaint with the Washington State Attorney General’s Office. Contact details are below.
* You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. If a person takes an adverse action against you that is based, in whole or in part, on information contained in a consumer report, that person must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency that provided the information.
* You have a right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency, although medical information may be withheld and given directly to your medical provider. You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You will not be charged for:
    * a consumer report if a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;
    * the reinvestigation of information you dispute; or
    * corrected reports resulting from the deletion of inaccurate or unverifiable information.

In addition, you are entitled to one free consumer report every 12 months, upon request.

* You may be charged a limited fee for a second or subsequent report requested by you during a 12 month period. You have a right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and you notify the consumer reporting agency directly of the dispute, the consumer reporting agency will reinvestigate without charge and record the current status of the disputed information before the end of thirty business days, unless your dispute is frivolous.
* Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Upon completion of the reinvestigation, if the information you disputed is found to be inaccurate or cannot be verified, the consumer reporting agency will delete the information and notify you of the correction. If the reinvestigation does not resolve your dispute, you may file with the consumer reporting agency a brief statement setting forth the nature of your dispute. The statement will be placed in your consumer file and in any subsequent report containing the information you disputed.
* Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than ten years old.
* Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need – usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The WFCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.
* You must be notified if reports are provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to employers without your knowledge. A potential employer must make a clear and conspicuous disclosure in writing to you or obtain your consent before obtaining a report. A current employer may not receive a report unless it has given you written notice that consumer reports may be used for employment purposes.
* You may limit “prescreened” offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. You may elect not to receive unsolicited “prescreened” offers for credit and insurance by using the consumer reporting agency’s notification system to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).
* You may place a security freeze on your credit report. A security freeze prevents your credit file from being shared with potential creditors or insurance companies. You may request a security freeze by contacting MicroBilt Corporation at, Attn: Compliance Department, PO Box 440693, Kennesaw, GA 30160, or call the following number: 888-222-7621, or 800-884-4747 option# 5, or fax: 404-393-9512. We may charge a fee for providing this service.
* You may be able to block information resulting from identity theft from appearing on your credit report. If you are a victim of identity theft, a consumer reporting agency must permanently block misinformation resulting from that theft from appearing on your credit report. You must provide the consumer reporting agency with a copy of a police report as evidence of your claim before it can place the block on your report.
* You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the WFCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal co

**NOTICE REGARDING BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION**

**PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA LAW**

**(For California Applicants and Employees Only)**

  

**{{{company\_name}}}** ("the Company") intends to obtain information about you from an investigative consumer reporting agency for employment purposes. Thus, you can expect to be the subject of "investigative consumer reports" obtained for employment purposes. Such reports may include information about your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living. With respect to any investigative consumer report from an investigative consumer reporting agency ("ICRA"), the Company may investigate the information contained in your employment application and other background information about you, including but not limited to: your social security number and identification documents, criminal history, sex offender registry status, credit history, employment history, education history, driving history, professional licenses, drug testing results. The Company may also obtain comments from individuals who are knowledgeable about you . These reports may be used as a factor in making employment decisions. The source of any investigative consumer report (as that term is defined under California law) will be Certn (USA) Inc., 3820 Central Avenue #220, Cheyenne, WY 82001, 844-987-0690. Information regarding Certn's privacy practices (including information about whether any consumer personal information will be sent outside the U.S. or its territories) may be found at https: // certn . co / .

Under California Civil Code section 1786.22, you are entitled to find out from an ICRA what is in the ICRA's file on you with proper identification, as follows:

  

In person, by visual inspection of your file during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. You also may request a copy of the information in person. The ICRA may not charge you more than the actual copying costs for providing you with a copy of your file.

* By requesting a copy be sent to a specified addressee by certified mail. ICRAs complying with requests for certified mailings shall not be liable for disclosures to third parties caused by mishandling of mail after such mailings leave the ICRAs.

A summary of all information contained in the ICRA's file on you (which is required to be provided

by the California Civil Code) will be provided to you via telephone, if you have made a written request for telephone disclosure and the toll charge, if any, for the telephone call is prepaid by or charged directly to you.

Une copie des mesures techniques et organisationnelles de Certn est énoncée dans l’ANNEXE II. Si le Traitement porte sur des Renseignements personnels révélant des données sensibles ou biométriques dans le but d’identifier de manière exceptionnelle une personne physique, ou des données relatives à des condamnations et à des infractions criminelles, Certn doit appliquer des restrictions précises et/ou des mesures de protection supplémentaires, tel que peut l’exiger raisonnablement le Client à l’occasion.

    3. En cas d’atteinte à la vie privée, l’une ou l’autre des Parties doit aviser l’autre Partie sans délai indu et au plus tard 24 heures après avoir pris connaissance de ladite atteinte. Cet avis doit contenir les coordonnées d’une personne-ressource qui peut fournir de plus amples renseignements sur l’atteinte à la vie privée, une description de la nature de l’atteinte(y compris, si possible, les catégories et le nombre approximatif de Personnes concernées et d’enregistrements de données concernés), les conséquences probables de l’atteinte et les mesures prises ou proposées pour atténuer ses éventuels effets négatifs. S’il n’est pas possible de fournir tous ces renseignements en même temps, l’avis initial doit contenir les renseignements disponibles à ce moment-là, et les renseignements complémentaires doivent être fournis au fur et à mesure qu’ils deviennent disponibles, sans retard excessif.
7. **Droits des consommateurs.** Certn doit aviser rapidement le Client s’il reçoit une Demande d’accès par la Personne concernée. Le Client est responsable de la réponse aux Demandes d’accès des Personnes concernées et, cependant, dans la mesure où le Client n’a pas la capacité de donner suite à une Demande d’accès de la Personne concernée, Certn doit déployer des efforts raisonnables, lorsque la loi l’exige ou à la demande du Client, pour aider le Client à répondre à cette demande d’accès de la Personne concernée sans frais supplémentaires pendant la période de validité de la Loi applicable.

    1. Les Sous-traitants ultérieurs de Certn (tels qu’ils se trouvent ici) sont les entités mandatées par Certn qui acceptent de recevoir des Renseignements personnels de la part du Sous-traitant aux fins exclusives des activités de Traitement à effectuer selon les instructions du Client.

Certn peut écarter, remplacer ou désigner d’autres Sous-traitants ultérieurs adéquats et fiables, sur avis au Client et à sa propre discrétion.
    2. Nonobstant ce qui précède, le Client peut raisonnablement s’opposer à l’utilisation, par Certn, d’un nouveau Sous-traitant ultérieur pour des raisons liées à la protection des Renseignements personnels destinés à être Traités par ledit Sous-traitant ultérieur, en avisant rapidement par écrit Certn dans les trois (3) jours ouvrables suivant la réception de l’avis de Certn. Une telle objection écrite doit préciser les motifs pour lesquels le Client s’oppose au fait que le Sous-traitant fasse appel à ce Sous-traitant ultérieur. L’absence d’objection écrite à ce nouveau Sous-traitant ultérieur dans les trois (3) jours ouvrables suivant l’avis de Certn sera considérée comme une acceptation du nouveau Sous-traitant ultérieur. Dans le cas où le Client s’oppose raisonnablement à un nouveau Sous-traitant ultérieur, comme cela est autorisé ci-dessus, Certn peut :
        1. cesser d’utiliser le Sous-traitant ultérieur en ce qui concerne les Renseignements personnels soumis par le Client;
        2. prendre les mesures correctives demandées par le Client dans son objection;
        3. cesser de fournir (temporairement ou définitivement) l’élément du service qui nécessite l’utilisation de ce Sous-traitant ultérieur en ce qui concerne les Renseignements personnels soumis par le Client; et
        4. fournir au Client une description écrite de la ou des solutions de rechange commercialement raisonnables, le cas échéant, à cet engagement, y compris, sans s’y limiter, la modification des services
    3. Si Certn, à sa seule discrétion, ne peut fournir une ou plusieurs des solutions de rechange énumérées ci-dessus , ou si le Client n’accepte pas la ou les éventuelles solutions de rechange, alors Certn et le Client peuvent résilier le Contrat conformément aux Modalités de ce dernier. La résiliation ne dégage pas le Client de tous les frais dus à Certn en vertu du Contrat. Jusqu’à ce qu’une décision soit prise concernant le nouveau Sous-traitant ultérieur, Certn peut, au besoin, suspendre temporairement le Traitement des Renseignements personnels concernés et/ou suspendre l’accès au compte, et le Client n’aura aucune autre réclamation à l’encontre du Sous-traitant ultérieur en raison de la suspension temporaire ou de la résiliation du Contrat (y compris, sans limitation, relativement à une demande de remboursement).
    4. Certn doit assurer que tous les Sous-traitants ultérieurs autorisés ont signé des accords de confidentialité qui les empêchent de Traiter sans autorisation les Renseignements personnels du Client, tant pendant qu’après leur engagement auprès de Certn. En outre, Certn doit (par exemple, par voie de contrat ou d’un autre acte juridique) imposer au Sous-traitant ultérieur les mêmes obligations de protection des données que celles énoncées dans le présent ATD.
9. **Transferts internationaux de données.**
    1. **Les transferts internationaux de données sont assujettis aux CCT.** Lorsque le transfert des Renseignements personnels est effectué sous réserve des CCT, l’« importateur des données », en vertu des CCT, est soit le Sous-traitant, soit le Sous-traitant ultérieur, selon le cas et selon ce que détermine le Sous-traitant, et l’« exportateur des données » est le Responsable du Traitement de ces Données à caractère personnel. Le Sous-traitant doit s’assurer que le Sous-traitant ultérieur concerné, le cas échéant, se conforme aux obligations de l’importateur des données, et le Responsable du Traitement des données doit se conformer aux obligations de l’exportateur de données, dans chaque cas en vertu des CCT applicables.
    2. **Transferts internationaux de données depuis et vers des pays qui offrent un niveau adéquat de protection des données.** Les Renseignements personnels peuvent être transférés depuis les États membres de l’UE et les pays membres de l’EEE (Norvège, Liechtenstein et Islande) (collectivement, « EEE ») vers des pays qui offrent un niveau adéquat de protection des données (y compris le Canada) en vertu ou conformément aux décisions d’adéquation publiées par les autorités de protection des données de l’EEE ou de la Commission européenne (« décisions d’adéquation »), selon le cas, sans qu’aucune autre mesure de protection ne soit nécessaire.
    3. **Transferts depuis la Suisse.** Dans la mesure où le Préposé fédéral à la protection des données et à la transparence (PFPDT) de la Suisse considère que les CCT assurent des mesures de protection appropriées aux fins du transfert des Renseignements personnels et des données des entités juridiques, les modifications suivantes s’appliquent en ce qui concerne les transferts suisses :
        1. les Parties adoptent la norme RGPD pour tous les transferts de données;
        2. en ce qui concerne la clause 13a, l’autorité de surveillance de l’UE doit être compétente dans la mesure où le transfert de données est régi par le RGPD et le Préposé fédéral à la protection des données et à la transparence de la Suisse doit effectuer une supervision parallèle, le cas échéant; et
        3. en ce qui concerne la clause 18c, le terme « État membre » doit être interprété de manière à permettre aux Personnes concernées en Suisse d’entamer des poursuites pour assurer le respect de leurs droits dans leur lieu de résidence habituel (Suisse).
    4. **Transferts depuis le Royaume-Uni.** Dans la mesure où l’Autorité de surveillance du Royaume-Uni (le Commissaire à l’information) considère que les CCT assurent des mesures de protection appropriées aux fins de transfert des Renseignements personnels vers un pays tiers ou vers un organisme international en se fondant sur les articles 46 du RGPD du Royaume-Uni et, en ce qui concerne les transferts de données des Responsables du Traitement aux Sous-traitants et/ou des Sous-traitants aux Sous-traitants, les modifications suivantes s’appliquent en ce qui concerne les transferts depuis le Royaume-Uni :
        1. « Les détails du ou des transferts et en particulier les catégories de Renseignements personnels qui sont transférés et la ou les finalités pour lesquelles ils sont transférés) sont ceux spécifiés à l’annexe I.B lorsque les Lois britanniques sur la protection des données s’appliquent au traitement de l’exportateur de données lors de ce ou ces transferts. »
        2. Les références à « Règlement (UE) 2016/679 » ou « ce Règlement » sont remplacées par « Lois britanniques sur la protection des données » et les références à l’article ou aux articles spécifiques du « Règlement (UE) 2016/679 » sont remplacées par l’article ou la section équivalents des Lois britanniques sur la protection des données. En particulier :
            1. Les références au règlement (UE) 2018/1725 sont supprimées;
            2. Les références à l’« Union », à l’« UE » et à l’« État membre de l’UE » sont toutes remplacées par le « R.-U. »;
            3. La clause 13(a) n’est pas utilisée et l’« autorité de surveillance compétente » est le commissaire à l’information;
            4. La clause 17 est remplacée par la mention « Ces CCT sont régies par les lois de l’Angleterre et du Pays de Galles »;
            5. La clause 18 est remplacée par la mention suivante : « Tout différend découlant de ces CCT doit être résolu par les tribunaux d’Angleterre et du Pays de Galles. Une Personne concernée peut également intenter des procédures judiciaires contre l’exportateur de données et/ou l’importateur de données devant les tribunaux de tout pays du Royaume-Uni. Les Parties conviennent de se soumettre à la compétence de ces tribunaux »; et
            6. Les notes de bas de page relatives aux CCT ne s’appliquent pas aux transferts depuis le Royaume-Uni.
10. **Divers.** Le Responsable du Traitement des données ne doit pas refuser ou retarder de manière déraisonnable son approbation à une éventuelle modification du présent ATD proposée par le Sous-traitant dans le but de protéger ce dernier contre les risques additionnels connexes. Si le Responsable du Traitement propose d’autres variations au présent ATD qu’il estime raisonnablement nécessaires pour répondre aux exigences des lois applicables, les Parties doivent discuter promptement des variations proposées et négocier en toute bonne foi afin d’accepter et de mettre en œuvre ces variations ou d’autres variations dès que cela sera raisonnablement possible. Nonobstant ce qui précède, sur présentation d’un avis au Client, Certn peut réviser le présent Addenda afin d’y intégrer toute CCT obligatoire ou toute autre condition exigée par une autorité compétente en matière de protection des données dans l’UE ou au Royaume-Uni.

L’Utilisateur final doit mettre en oeuvre et maintenir un programme complet de sécurité de l’information qui contient des mesures de protection administratives, techniques et physiques qui sont appropriées à la taille et à la complexité de l’Utilisateur final, à la nature et à la portée de ses activités et à la sensibilité des Antécédents personnels qui vous sont fournis par Certn; et que ces mesures de protection sont raisonnablement conçues pour i) assurer la sécurité et la confidentialité des renseignements fournis par Certn, ii) se protéger contre les menaces ou les risques prévus pour la sécurité ou l’intégrité de ces renseignements et iii) se protéger contre l’accès, l’utilisation, la divulgation, la modification, la destruction ou toute autre interférence non autorisée de ces renseignements qui pourrait entraîner un préjudice ou un inconvénient important pour tout Consommateur (« **Incident de sécurité** »).
    2. En plus de ce qui précède, l’Utilisateur final maintiendra une politique de confidentialité clairement et précisément divulguée aux Consommateurs et conforme aux Lois applicables et maintiendra des procédures strictes pour garantir que le personnel ne puisse pas utiliser les Antécédents personnels ou les Rapports à des fins inappropriées, illégales ou non autorisées, conformément à des exigences similaires aux exigences de l’article 6103(p)(4) de l’Internal Revenue Code de 1986.
    3. Vous acceptez de ne pas : i) copier, distribuer, louer, prêter, concéder en vertu d’une sous-licence ou transférer la Plateforme, ou mettre la Plateforme à la disposition d’un tiers, y compris vos sociétés affiliées, sociétés mères ou filiales sans le consentement écrit préalable exprès de Certn, ii) modifier, décompiler, désosser ou désassembler la Plateforme ou tenter autrement de découvrir le code source sous-jacent, ou des idées, algorithmes, formats de fichiers ou interfaces de programmation, iii) créer des œuvres dérivées basées sur la Plateforme; iv) modifier, supprimer ou dissimuler tout droit d’auteur, marque de commerce, les avis de brevet ou autres avis ou légendes qui apparaissent sur la Plateforme; v) utiliser la Plateforme pour élaborer une offre de produits concurrentielle; vi) utiliser des agents, robots, scripts, araignées, ou d’autres moyens automatisés d’accéder à la Plateforme ou de la gérer; ou vii) permettre à votre personnel d’accéder à la Plateforme ou de commander des Rapports à des fins illégales ou non autorisées; y compris sur eux-mêmes, les associés, ou toute autre personne, sauf dans l’exercice de ses fonctions officielles.
    4. **Clés API.** Certn mettra les clés API à votre disposition pour accéder à la Plateforme, le cas échéant. Vous êtes responsable de la sécurisation de vos clés API, et vous acceptez de ne pas les publier ou les partager avec des personnes non autorisées, y compris vos fournisseurs de services, sauf approbation écrite de Certn. Vous communiquerez immédiatement avec Certn si vous prenez connaissance de toute utilisation non autorisée de vos clés API.
8. **INFORMATIONS CONFIDENTIELLES.**
    1. Chaque partie assurera la confidentialité de toutes les informations et documents fournis ou mis à disposition, directement ou indirectement, par l’autre partie qui sont marqués comme confidentiels ou exclusifs, ou qui sont identifiés comme confidentiels ou exclusifs au moment de la divulgation, ou la nature des renseignements et la manière dont ils sont divulgués sont telles qu’une personne raisonnable les considérerait comme étant confidentiels (collectivement, les « **Informations confidentielles** »). Les informations confidentielles de Certn comprennent, sans s’y limiter, les caractéristiques, la fonctionnalité et le contenu de la Plateforme et toute modification ou mise à jour prévue de celle-ci, les Frais et les renseignements sur les prix.
    2. Chaque partie maintiendra la stricte confidentialité de toutes les informations confidentielles en exerçant au moins le même niveau de diligence qu’elle exerce pour ses propres informations confidentielles, mais en aucun cas moins qu’une norme de diligence prudente et raisonnable. Chaque partie peut utiliser les informations confidentielles uniquement aux fins de l’exécution de ses obligations ou de l’exercice de ses droits en vertu des présentes. Les informations dont l’une ou l’autre des parties peut établir : a) qu’ils étaient légalement en possession d’une partie avant d’être reçus de l’autre partie; ou b) qu’ils sont ou deviennent un sujet de connaissance publique sans qu’il y ait faute de la partie qui les reçoit; ou c) qu’ils ont été développés ou découverts de façon indépendante par une partie sans le bénéfice des informations confidentielles de l’autre partie, ne seront pas considérés comme des informations confidentielles en vertu du présent Contrat. Chaque partie ne peut divulguer des informations confidentielles qu’à ses employés et représentants qui ont besoin de les connaître pour atteindre les objectifs du présent accord et dont chacun est tenu de protéger les informations confidentielles contre une utilisation et une divulgation non autorisées en vertu d’un accord écrit dont les conditions sont aussi protectrices des informations confidentielles que celles énoncées dans le présent Contrat. Chaque partie peut également divulguer des informations confidentielles en réponse à une ordonnance valide d’un tribunal ou d’un autre organisme gouvernemental ou si la loi l’exige; à condition que la partie qui répond donne un préavis suffisant à la partie qui divulgue les informations pour lui permettre de prendre des mesures de protection et/ou, dans tous les cas, de ne divulguer que les informations confidentielles exacts, ou une partie de ceux-ci, spécifiquement demandés.
    3. Chaque partie convient que toute violation de ces dispositions de confidentialité causera un préjudice irréparable à l’autre partie donnant à l’autre partie droit à des mesures injonctives ou à une autre mesure équitable, en plus, et non en remplacement, de tout autre recours auquel cette partie peut avoir droit. La divulgation des informations confidentielles sera régie par le présent Contrat, qui remplace tout accord de confidentialité ou de non-divulgation antérieur signé par les parties ou en leur nom. Ces informations confidentielles seront traitées comme si elles avaient été divulguées en vertu du présent Contrat (et si le présent Contrat était en vigueur) à la date de cet échange.

**Nous** traitons vos Renseignements personnels pour (i) fournir nos Services, (ii) pour communiquer avec vous, (iii) à des fins de sécurité et de prévention des fraudes, et (iv) pour se conformer à la loi. Nous pouvons également utiliser les Renseignements personnels à d’autres fins assujetties à votre consentement. Nous ne traiterons pas vos Renseignements personnels à moins que nous en ayons légalement le droit de le faire. .

Pour Traiter vos Renseignements personnels en toute légalité, nous nous appuyons au minimum sur un fondement juridique tel que défini par la loi applicable. En fonction de la relation que vous entretenez avec nous, le fondement juridique permettant de Traiter vos Renseignements personnels peut inclure, entre autres, votre consentement, l’obligation de Traiter les données pour l’exécution d’un contrat avec vous, pour se conformer à une obligation légale ou sur la base d’un intérêt légitime.

Si votre consentement représente le fondement juridique sur lequel nous nous appuyons afin de recueillir et d’utiliser vos Renseignements personnels, vous pouvez retirer ou modifier votre consentement à la collecte ou à l’utilisation future de vos Renseignements personnels à tout moment, et nous vous expliquerons les conséquences de ce geste. Si nous utilisons vos Renseignements personnels à des fins de vente ou de marketing, vous pouvez nous demander d’interrompre cette activité à tout moment et nous agirons en conséquence.

### **Finalité autorisée pour le traitement**

Nos Clients doivent certifier avoir un objectif autorisé avant que nous puissions Traiter les Renseignements personnels aux fins de la prestation des Services. « **Finalité autorisée** » comprend les fins d’emploi, les fins de location ou conformément aux instructions écrites du Consommateur avec lequel le Client a l’intention de conclure un contrat.

Nous ne réutiliserons pas les Renseignements personnels à d’autres fins que celles pour lesquelles ils ont été recueillis, à moins qu’une ou plusieurs des conditions suivantes ne soient avérées :

* la nouvelle utilisation est compatible avec l’utilisation initiale, ce qui signifie que vous devriez raisonnablement vous y attendre;
* nous vous avons informé de la nouvelle utilisation et vous avons donné l’occasion de vous y opposer; ou
* la nouvelle utilisation est autrement autorisée ou exigée par la loi.

Nous recueillons, utilisons et divulguons les Renseignements personnels des Consommateurs lorsque ceux-ci sont conscients de la Finalité autorisée pour laquelle les renseignements seront traités et qu’ils ont donné leur consentement à un tel Traitement, sauf lorsque le Traitement des Renseignements personnels sans consentement est autorisé ou exigé par la loi. Sous réserve des exigences réglementaires, l’exploitation de nos Services dans certains territoires exige que nous ou nos Clients obtenions des consentements supplémentaires ou particuliers sous forme de formulaires de consentement supplémentaires, d’appels téléphoniques, par l’intermédiaire d’une plateforme en ligne ou d’autres méthodes. Lorsque le Consommateur ne nous donne pas directement ce consentement ou un consentement spécifique, mais le donne à nos Clients, nous demandons à nos Clients d’obtenir le consentement du Consommateur avant de nous fournir les Renseignements personnels du Consommateur soumis à vérification pour l’un de nos Services. Le Consommateur peut retirer ce consentement précédemment accordé à tout moment en communiquant avec nous. Le retrait de ce consentement n’influe nullement sur la légalité de tout traitement fondé sur le consentement avant le retrait.

### **Quels renseignements traitons-nous?**

* **Traitement** **des renseignements non personnels** **:** Nous traitons les Renseignements non personnels afin de suivre les tendances et d’analyser les habitudes d’utilisation de notre site Web et de notre plateforme. Les renseignements non personnels (« **renseignements non personnels** ») désignent des renseignements ou du contenu autres que des Renseignements personnels, y compris, par exemple, des renseignements agrégés ou anonymisés sur nos utilisateurs et d’autres renseignements qui n’identifient aucune personne.
* **Traitement des renseignements sur les visiteurs du site Web :** Nous pouvons enregistrer le nom et la version de votre système d’exploitation, l’identifiant de l’appareil, le type de navigateur, le système d’exploitation, l’adresse du protocole Internet (IP), la résolution de l’écran, les pages que vous avez consultées sur notre ou nos sites Web, le temps que vous avez passé sur une page, les heures d’accès, les renseignements généraux sur l’emplacement comme la ville, l’État ou la zone géographique, et les renseignements sur votre utilisation et vos actions sur notre site Web.
* **Traitement des Renseignements personnels des Clients :** Lorsque vous vous abonnez à nos Services, on pourrait vous demander de saisir votre nom complet, votre adresse courriel, votre nom d’entreprise, votre adresse professionnelle, votre numéro de téléphone, votre adresse de facturation, votre adresse de carte et d’autres renseignements fournis par le Client dans des champs personnalisés, le cas échéant. Les renseignements financiers, tels que les données liées à votre mode de paiement (p. ex. numéro de carte de crédit valide, marque de carte, date d’expiration) ne sont jamais recueillis par nous, que ce soit sur notre site Web ou autrement. Lors du traitement des paiements, vous êtes transféré vers une page sécurisée du site Web de Stripe ou d’un autre fournisseur de services de paiement certifié PCI DSS. Cette page peut être vêtue de notre « livrée », mais elle n’est pas gérée par nous. Tous les renseignements financiers sont traités par notre service de traitement des paiements et nous vous encourageons à consulter sa politique de confidentialité et à communiquer directement avec lui pour obtenir des réponses à vos questions.
* **Traitement des Renseignements personnels des Consommateurs :** Certn ne recueillera les Renseignements personnels des Consommateurs que si vous choisissez volontairement de les fournir en raison d’une vérification des antécédents autorisée par vous et/ou par les lois applicables. Le type de Renseignements personnels que Certn peut recueillir à votre sujet par l’intermédiaire de notre site Web ou autrement varie en fonction des réglementations locales et de la demande de Service de vérification des données.

### **Comment traitons-nous les Renseignements personnels?**

La plupart des Renseignements personnels que nous recueillons proviennent de vous, directement ou par l’entremise de l’un de nos Clients. Nos processus de collecte et de transcription des Renseignements personnels sont automatisés dans la mesure du possible et sont soumis à des contrôles de qualité rigoureux. Les renseignements qui s’avèrent inexacts, soit à l’issue de nos propres vérifications, soit à la suite de votre demande de correction, sont mis à jour.

Lorsque nous fournissons des Services directement aux Consommateurs :

* Vous déterminez les Renseignements personnels que nous recueillons et leur finalité;
* Une fois que nous aurons reçu votre consentement, nous recueillerons et traiterons les renseignements conformément aux lois applicables; et
* Vous contrôlez et possédez les Renseignements personnels, et vous pouvez en demander la correction ou la suppression à tout moment.

Lorsque nous fournissons des Services aux Clients :

* Le Client fournit des instructions sur les Renseignements personnels à recueillir et sur la façon de les recueillir;
* Le cas échéant, le Client s’assure que les Consommateurs sont avisés de la collecte et du Traitement de leurs Renseignements personnels, ou qu’ils donnent leur consentement à cette fin, conformément aux lois applicables;
* Le Client s’assure que les Renseignements personnels sont recueillis et traités légalement, équitablement et de manière transparente, conformément à la Finalité autorisée;
* Le Client confirme que les Renseignements personnels sont exacts et, au besoin, tenus à jour, corrigés ou effacés; et
* Le Client s’assure que des mesures de protection appropriées sont en place pour protéger les Renseignements personnels.

Nous sommes généralement responsables des aspects suivants de la collecte et du Traitement des Renseignements personnels :

* Nous réalisons les Services demandés par notre Client ou notre Consommateur, conformément à leurs instructions;
* Nous protégeons les Renseignements personnels dont nous avons la garde contre la perte, le vol, l’accès, la divulgation, la copie, l’utilisation ou la modification non autorisés, d’une manière adaptée à leur caractère sensible, et conformément aux instructions de notre Client et aux lois applicables;
* Nous nous conformons à toutes les obligations légales qui peuvent nous incomber en tant que Sous-traitants de données, dépositaire, fournisseur de services ou dans l’exercice de fonctions semblables en vertu des lois applicables.

La collecte de Renseignements personnels à des fins de sécurité se fait en fonction de notre intérêt légitime et de notre obligation légale de nous assurer que les Renseignements personnels dont nous avons la garde sont protégés.

**6\. COMMENT LES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS SONT-ILS PARTAGÉS ET QUAND NOUS LIVRONS-NOUS AU TRAITEMENT TRANSFRONTALIER?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Les Renseignements personnels que nous recueillons sont stockés sur l’infrastructure fournie par AWS au Canada, ainsi qu’aux États-Unis, au Royaume-Uni et en Australie (« **Emplacements** **de stockage** »). Il peut être nécessaire pour nous de recueillir, de Traiter et de divulguer des Renseignements personnels au-delà des frontières, y compris en dehors de nos emplacements de stockage, afin de vérifier les antécédents professionnels ou scolaires, en plus de fournir d’autres Services semblables. À ce titre, nous pouvons transférer vos Renseignements personnels pour les raisons suivantes :

1. Décision d’adéquation
2. Mesures de protection appropriées
3. Votre consentement
4. Autres dispositions juridictionnelles

Dans les cas où le Client est situé dans l’État de Californie, la province de Québec, le Royaume-Uni, l’Australie, l’UE et/ou l’EEE, ou si le Consommateur réside dans l’État de Californie, le Royaume-Uni, l’UE et/ou l’EEE, des exigences particulières peuvent s’appliquer au transfert de Renseignements personnels. Lorsque vous naviguez sur notre site Web, vous consentez à cette Politique. De plus, lorsque vous soumettez vos renseignements, vous consentez à un tel transfert transfrontalier.

Nous prenons toutes les mesures raisonnablement nécessaires pour nous assurer que vos Renseignements personnels sont traités de manière sécurisée et conformément à la présente Politique, et nous ne transférerons pas les Renseignements personnels à un organisme ou à un pays, à moins qu’il n’y ait des contrôles adéquats en place pour assurer la sécurité de vos données.

Si vous avez des questions sur le Traitement de vos renseignements à l’étranger ou si vous avez des restrictions ou des conditions concernant la divulgation de vos renseignements au-delà des frontières, veuillez communiquer avec nous dès que possible afin que nous puissions discuter de vos exigences particulières.

**7.QUI D’AUTRE PEUT ACCÉDER AUX RENSEIGNEMENTS RECUEILLIS?**

* des tiers qui fournissent des services pour nous ou pour notre compte, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, le traitement des paiements, l’analyse des données, la livraison des courriels, et les services SaaS, IaaS ou PaaS.

Lorsque nous fournissons des Services à un Client, les Renseignements personnels du Consommateur sont traités et signalés par l’entremise de notre plateforme sécurisée. Outre nos Clients et le personnel autorisé de Certn qui peuvent accéder à vos Renseignements personnels aux fins décrites dans la présente Politique, nous pouvons fournir vos Renseignements personnels aux autorités ou aux sociétés partenaires qui fournissent des services pour nous aider dans nos activités commerciales, comme la prestation d’un service à la Clientèle ou le traitement de votre paiement. Pour en savoir plus sur les sociétés tierces qui nous fournissent de tels services, veuillez cliquer [ici](https://info.certn.co/dpa-subprocessors/).

Dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, nous pouvons être tenus de communiquer des Renseignements personnels à des organismes d’application de la loi, à des organismes de sécurité nationale, à des tribunaux ou à d’autres institutions semblables, comme l’exige la loi. Si nous recevons une commande de production, une assignation à témoigner, un mandat ou toute autre demande exécutoire, nous agirons conformément aux lois applicables. Nous ne vendons ni ne divulguons vos Renseignements personnels à des gouvernements, à des services de marketing ou de publicité, à d’autres Clients ou à quiconque, sauf dans les cas prévus dans la présente Politique ou comme l’exige la loi.

**8\. COMMENT STOCKONS-NOUS ET PROTÉGEONS-NOUS LES RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nous sommes certifiés SOC2, SOC3 et ISO27001 et nous maintenons des mesures de protection techniques, administratives, organisationnelles, physiques, électroniques et procédurales avancées qui respectent ces normes et protègent vos Renseignements personnels contre l’accès, la perte, l’utilisation abusive, l’interférence ou la modification non autorisés au moment de leur collecte, de leur utilisation, de leur divulgation et de leur stockage. Nous effectuons régulièrement des vérifications de sécurité, des analyses de vulnérabilité et des tests de pénétration pour assurer la conformité aux pratiques et aux normes de sécurité de l’industrie.

Tout notre personnel et tous nos fournisseurs et Sous-traitants font l’objet d’un contrôle de sécurité avant d’accepter un emploi. Tous les membres du personnel ont reçu une formation en protection des données et sont conscients de leurs responsabilités. Une telle formation est dispensée à plusieurs reprises, de façon régulière ou aléatoire, mais au moins une fois par an.

Nous limitons l’accès aux Renseignements personnels aux personnes ayant un besoin commercial légitime, conformément à la raison et à l’objectif pour lesquels les renseignements ont été fournis. Nous mettons en œuvre diverses mesures de sécurité pour assurer la sécurité de vos Renseignements personnels lorsque des commandes sont passées ou lorsque vous saisissez ou soumettez vos Renseignements personnels ou que vous y accédez. Nous chiffrons les renseignements traités en transit et au repos. Tous les renseignements sensibles fournis sont transmis au moyen du protocole de sécurité de la couche transport (« Transport Layer Security » o « TLS »), puis stockés dans notre base de données et accessibles uniquement par les personnes autorisées ayant des droits d’accès spéciaux à nos systèmes et qui sont tenues de préserver la confidentialité des renseignements.

De plus, nous avons mis en place des processus pour encourager nos Clients à se conformer aux lois sur le droit à la vie privée et aux normes de sécurité applicables. Ces processus comprennent, sans s’y limiter, la conclusion d’ententes contraignantes avec nos Clients et la réalisation de vérifications mutuelles aléatoires des procédures et pratiques internes de chacun afin de veiller à ce que les normes réglementaires et les niveaux de sécurité soient en tout temps respectés et dépassés mutuellement.

**9\. PENDANT COMBIEN DE TEMPS VOS RENSEIGNEMENTS PERSONNELS SONT-ILS CONSERVÉS?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nous conserverons vos renseignements pendant aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour vous fournir nos Services et/ou pour nous conformer à nos obligations contractuelles et légales, résoudre les différends et faire respecter nos accords.

Les données requises pour prouver la validité d’un droit ou d’un contrat seront conservées pendant la durée prévue par la loi applicable. À votre demande de résiliation de votre compte, nous désactiverons ou supprimerons votre compte et les renseignements de nos bases de données actives. Cependant, certains renseignements peuvent être conservés dans nos dossiers pour prévenir la fraude, dépanner les problèmes, contribuer à toute enquête, faire respecter nos conditions ou se conformer aux exigences légales.

En ce qui concerne les Renseignements personnels des Consommateurs, à moins que les dossiers n’aient été soumis à une demande de suppression, le calendrier de conservation et d’élimination ne doit pas dépasser trois (3) ans. Des exceptions peuvent exister pour des ensembles de données spécifiques régis par les exigences de conservation réglementaires ou de la part de tiers fournisseurs de données. Par exemple, nous ne stockerons aucune de vos données biométriques après la vérification de votre identité par OneID. Au besoin, nous pouvons conserver des renseignements généraux dans un journal et à des fins de vérification.

**10\. COMMENT EXERCER VOS DROITS À LA VIE PRIVÉE?**
----------------------------------------------------

Quel que soit votre lieu de résidence, nous examinerons gratuitement toute demande relative à la protection de la vie privée et prendrons des mesures pour vous aider à exercer vos droits en matière de protection de la vie privée, quant à : i) être informé, ii) accéder, iii) rectifier, iv) effacer, v) limiter le Traitement, vi) assurer la portabilité des données, vii) s’opposer au traitement, viii) ne pas faire l’objet d’une décision fondée sur une prise de décision automatisée, et ix) déposer une plainte.

Vous pouvez utiliser les informations de la section « Nous joindre » pour soulever toute demande ou question concernant l’exercice de vos droits à la vie privée.

À la réception d’une demande écrite, et après avoir vérifié que vous êtes le propriétaire des données, nous répondons aux demandes, aux différends et aux plaintes relatifs au droit à la vie privée dès que possible, et dans tous les cas, dans les délais prescrits par la loi. Toutefois, si nous refusons de le faire, nous vous donnerons un avis écrit en indiquant les raisons, et ce, dans les 30 jours suivant la réception de votre demande.

À des fins de conformité et lorsque la loi ou le contrat l’exige, avant de donner suite à une demande de droit à la vie privée, nous informerons le Client lié à cette demande, le cas échéant, ainsi que tout autre tiers qui pourrait avoir traité vos Renseignements personnels.

Aux fins de la Loi sur la protection des Renseignements personnels des consommateurs de la Californie (« California Consumer Privacy Act » ou « **CCPA** »), nous ne « vendons » pas de Renseignements personnels sur les Consommateurs à des tiers à des fins de marketing direct. Les Renseignements personnels traités aux fins de la vérification des antécédents sont exemptés de la CCPA.

Dans la mesure où vous êtes un résident californien et dans l’éventualité où nous aurions traité des catégories de vos Renseignements personnels au-delà de l’exemption de la CCPA dans le cadre d’une vérification des antécédents, vous avez le droit d’accéder à vos Renseignements personnels, de les supprimer, de les faire divulguer, de refuser de les vendre et d’être exempté de toute discrimination.

**12\. COMMENT UTILISONS-NOUS LES TÉMOINS?**
--------------------------------------------

Notre site Web utilise des témoins et d’autres technologies semblables pour fournir des fonctionnalités, analyser le trafic et personnaliser une partie de votre contenu Web.

**Que sont les témoins?**

Les témoins sont de petits fichiers de données texte qui sont envoyés à votre ordinateur ou appareil mobile par un site Web pendant la navigation. On vous présentera des renseignements sur nos témoins et une option vous permettant d’accepter tous les témoins ou personnaliser vos préférences en matière de témoins lors de votre première visite de notre site Web et occasionnellement à partir de la bannière de témoins par la suite. Vous pouvez consentir à tous les témoins ou les refuser à tout moment lorsque vous naviguez sur le site Web. Vous pouvez choisir et gérer tous vos témoins à tout moment par le biais des paramètres de votre navigateur. Si vous désactivez les témoins, vous pourriez ne pas être en mesure d’accéder ou d’utiliser pleinement certaines parties ou fonctionnalités du site Web.

Il existe différents types de témoins avec différentes fonctions :

* **Témoins de session :** ils ne sont stockés sur votre ordinateur que pendant votre session Web. Ils sont automatiquement supprimés lorsque le navigateur est fermé. Ils stockent habituellement un identifiant de session anonyme vous permettant de naviguer sur un site Web sans avoir à vous connecter à chaque page. Ils ne recueillent aucun renseignement sur votre ordinateur.
* **Témoins persistants :** un témoin persistant est un témoin stocké sous forme de fichier sur votre ordinateur et il y demeure lorsque vous fermez votre navigateur Web. Le témoin peut être lu par le site Web qui l’a créé lorsque vous revenez visiter ce site Web.
* **Témoins de première partie :** la fonction de ce type de témoin est de conserver vos préférences pour un site Web particulier pour l’entité propriétaire de ce site Web. Ils sont stockés et échangés entre les serveurs de Certn et le disque dur de votre ordinateur. Ils ne servent à rien d’autre que la personnalisation telle que définie par vous. Ces témoins peuvent être des témoins temporaires ou persistants.
* **Témoins tiers :** la fonction de ce type de témoin est de conserver votre interaction avec un site Web particulier pour une entité qui n’est pas propriétaire de ce site Web. Ils sont stockés et échangés entre le serveur d’un tiers et le disque dur de votre ordinateur. Ces témoins sont généralement des témoins persistants.

Les témoins de première partie sont nécessaires au bon fonctionnement de notre site Web. Notre site Web permet également l’utilisation de témoins tiers, qui peuvent être lus à l’externe par d’autres organismes. À ce titre, nous ne pouvons être tenus responsables des témoins tiers, c.-à-d. des témoins qui ne sont pas initiés par nous. Nos plateformes de service, que nous utilisons pour recueillir des renseignements auprès des Consommateurs et des Clients, n’utilisent pas de témoins tiers.

**Utilisation de témoins**

**Témoins nécessaires :** En utilisant notre site Web, vous acceptez que nous puissions stocker les témoins nécessaires sur votre appareil, en plus d’y accéder. Ces témoins ne recueillent pas de renseignements à votre sujet qui pourraient être utilisés à des fins de marketing ou de mémorisation des sites que vous avez visités sur Internet.

**Témoins** **statistiques :** Ils sont anonymes et ne peuvent pas être utilisés pour vous identifier. Les témoins statistiques nous aident à améliorer les fonctions de notre site Web et à recueillir des renseignements sur la façon dont vous utilisez le site Web (comme la fréquence à laquelle vous visitez notre site Web, les liens sur lesquels vous avez cliqué, les pages que vous préférez). Le consentement à ces témoins nous permettra de produire des rapports statistiques anonymes à des fins d’amélioration du site Web.

**Témoins de** **préférence :** Afin de mémoriser les choix que vous avez faits précédemment (comme la langue sélectionnée ou le nom d’utilisateur et le mot de passe enregistrés), de permettre une navigation plus rapide et de fournir des fonctions améliorées, nous devons activer les témoins de préférence. Les renseignements recueillis par ces témoins sont habituellement anonymisés.

**Témoins de** **marketing :** Ils peuvent être définis sur des sites Web par des tiers. Ils ne stockent pas de Renseignements personnels, mais identifient votre navigateur et votre appareil Internet pour aider les annonceurs à vous montrer des publicités pertinentes.

**Données du journal du site Web :** Les serveurs Web de Certn enregistrent les renseignements suivants lors des visites de notre site Web : Adresses IP, type de système d’exploitation, heure et durée de la visite, pages Web visitées et type de navigateur. Nous ne lions pas les informations du journal du serveur à d’autres informations d’une manière qui permettraient l’identification des visiteurs de notre site Web. En plus d’analyser ces journaux pour vous offrir une meilleure expérience sur notre site Web, les journaux du serveur peuvent être examinés à des fins de sécurité et, au besoin, pour détecter les activités non autorisées sur notre site Web. Dans de tels cas, les données de journal du serveur, contenant des adresses IP, seraient communiquées aux organismes d’application de la loi afin qu’ils puissent identifier les utilisateurs dans le cadre de leur enquête sur les activités non autorisées.

**13\. QUI EST L’AGENT DE PROTECTION DE LA VIE PRIVÉE?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Nous disposons d’un agent de protection de la vie privée qui peut être contacté en cas de problème de confidentialité ou de protection des données à l’adresse privacy@certn.co.

Cependant, cela peut nuire à l’URL et à la page Web (« site d’origine ») à partir desquelles vous avez accédé à notre site.

We need your consent to use a biometric facial scan to verify your identity. The biometric facial scan helps us determine that you are a real person and that no one else is pretending to be you.

Certn uses a secure biometric software to verify your identity. This software uses a real-time photo of you to create a digital map of your face that is instantly compared to the image of your identity document. We will not store the biometric digital map resulting from your facial scan. If you reside in a location that is different from our storage and our processor’s locations, Certn may transfer your Personal Information across jurisdictions, in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://certn.co/privacy-policy/) and the applicable privacy laws.

You can request more information about the nature and scope of data processing, ask for correction, deletion, or a copy of the information we hold about you by contacting Certn’s Privacy Officer at 1-844-987-0690 or [privacy@certn.co](mailto:privacy@certn.co).

I hereby consent to a search of all currently available criminal records and information, including non-conviction information, charges before the court, findings of guilt or convictions and court orders or records registered in my name in the National Repository of Criminal Records, the Canadian Police Information Centre (“CPIC”) database, the Police Information Portal (“PIP”) and any other data sharing platform available to the police service provider for the purposes of delivering a criminal record check in relation to my application for employment with the Employer (the “Employer”).  

I understand that this criminal record check is based on the name(s), date of birth and, where used, the declared criminal record history I provide. I understand that the results are not being confirmed by fingerprint comparison which is the only true means by which to confirm if a criminal record exists in the National Repository of Criminal Records.

I certify that the information set out by me in this application is true and correct to the best of my ability. I consent to the release of the results of the criminal record check to Certn and the Employer. I acknowledge and agree that the Employer may collect, use and disclose the information collected for the purposes of evaluating my suitability for employment with the Employer.

I acknowledge that if I do not consent to Certn’s and/or the Employer’s collection, use and disclosure of the information, this may result in my conditional offer of employment being void. Without a conditional offer of employment, I will not have an employment relationship with the Employer for any purposes.

I hereby release and forever discharge all members and employees of the processing police service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from any and all actions, claims and demands for damages, loss or injury whatsoever arising which may hereinafter be sustained by me as a result of the disclosure of information to Certn and the Employer.

By clicking “I understand and agree” I consent to Certn collecting, processing and disclosing my personal information pursuant to the terms set out above and Certn’s [Privacy Policy](https://certn.co/privacy-policy/).

La requête peut également comprendre une recherche dans les dossiers judiciaires et une interrogation des systèmes de gestion des dossiers dans les juridictions d’autres services de police par le biais du Portail d’informations policières (PIP) ou d’autres systèmes de partage de données.

Par la présente, je libère et décharge à jamais tous les membres et employeurs du service de police traitant et de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada de toutes actions, réclamations et demandes de dommages, pertes ou blessures, quelles qu'elles soient, qui pourraient être subies par moi-même à la suite de la divulgation d'informations à Certn,à l'Employeur ou au Cabinet de recrutement.

Biometric Notice  

Please review the below information before providing your consent for Certn to process your Biometric Data.

  

“**Biometric Data**” is personal information resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person.

  

**Why do you need my biometric data?**

  

As part of the remote background screening services we provide to our clients, we collect your Biometric Data to (i) remotely verify your identity, and (ii) prevent and combat fraud.

  

**How does it work?**

  

We will ask you to scan a copy of your government-issued ID, and take a selfie using your mobile device or laptop. We use an AI algorithm to measure certain features of your face in both your ID photo and your selfie, and compare them to one another to confirm the person completing background screening matches the person on the ID. This helps us combat fraud, and ensures we are providing accurate information to our clients.

  

**Who will have access to my Biometric Data?**

  

Except where required by law, your Biometric Data is accessible only to us and our service providers who require access to Biometric Data to help us provide our Services. We do not share Biometric Data with any other third parties. That said, we will provide certain information about you to the client on whose behalf we are performing the background check, which could include copies of the ID document and photo you provided us, and confirmation that we were or were not able to verify your identity.

  

Certn does not sell, lease, trade or otherwise profit from your Biometric Data.

  

**How will you protect my Biometric Data?**

  

The Company uses industry standard security safeguards to store and protect your Biometric Data, in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://vault.pactsafe.io/s/5d800911-f26c-4e3a-884d-85117a81799b/legal.html?g=37964#contract-byeg-ihlj). Unless required by law, once your identity has been verified, we will delete your biometric data from our systems within 30 days.

  

The location of Biometric Data storage is based on the location of our client. For example, if our client on whose behalf we are performing a background check is located in Canada, your Biometric Data will be stored in Canada. If you reside in a different country from our processing locations or the location of our client, we may transfer your Biometric Data for the purpose of completing the identity verification, in accordance with our Privacy Policy ([https://certn.co/privacy-policy/](https://certn.co/privacy-policy/)) and applicable privacy laws.

  

**What are my rights?**

  

You may choose not to consent to the processing of your Biometric Data. If you choose not to consent to biometric identity verification, we may not be able to process your application or provide verification results to our client.

  

You can also:

* revoke your consent to the processing of your Biometric Data,
* request a copy of your Biometric Data,
* request corrections to your Biometric Data, and
* request deletion of your Biometric Data,

  

at any time by contacting us at [privacy@certn.co](mailto:privacy@certn.co). Upon receiving notice, we will notify our client on whose behalf we are performing the background check, and promptly respond to your request.

  

If you require more information about the nature and scope of your data processing, please contact Certn’s Privacy Officer at [privacy@certn.co](mailto:privacy@certn.co).

**NOTICE REGARDING BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION**

**PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA LAW**

  

**{{{company\_name}}}** has requested an "investigative consumer report" on you for the purpose of evaluating your current or potential employment through [Certn](https://certn.co/) (an investigative consumer reporting agency or “ **ICRA**”). In California, an "**investigative consumer report** " is a background screening report that may contain information regarding your domestic and international background history, including but not limited to, your social security number and identification documents, criminal history, sex offender registry status, credit history, employment history, education history, driving history, professional licenses, drug testing results and other information about you. It may bear upon your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and/or mode of living. These reports may be used as a factor in making employment decisions. The source of any investigative consumer report (as that term is defined under California law) will be Certn (USA) Inc., 3820 Central Avenue #220, Cheyenne, WY 82001, 844-987-0690. Information regarding Certn's privacy practices (including information about whether any consumer personal information will be sent outside the U.S. or its territories) may be found [here](https://certn.co/) .

"**Proper Identification** " includes documents such as a valid driver's license, social security account number, military identification card, and credit cards.The ICRA will provide trained personnel to explain any information furnished to you and will provide a written explanation of any coded information contained in files maintained on you. This written explanation will be provided whenever a file is provided to you for visual inspection.

**State Consumers Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze**

You may obtain a security freeze on your consumer report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge, except as provided by law. You have a right to place a security freeze on your consumer report to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your consumer report without your express authorization or approval, except as the law allows.

You will not be initially charged to place a security freeze on your consumer report. However, you will be charged a fee of no more than ten dollars to temporarily lift the freeze for a period of time, to permanently remove the freeze from your consumer report, or when you make a subsequent request for a freeze to be placed on your consumer report. As well, you may be charged a fee of no more than twelve dollars to temporarily lift the freeze for a specific party.

The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your consumer report, within five business days you will be provided procedures for the temporary release of your consumer report to a specific party or parties or for a period of time after the security freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide the proper information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the consumer report or the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the consumer report.

A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a security freeze on a consumer report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.

A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship, and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities.

You should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gains access to the personal and financial information in your consumer report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding new loans, credit, mortgage, insurance, government services or payments, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, internet credit card transaction, or other services, including an extension of credit at the point of sale. You should plan ahead and lift a security freeze either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor a few days before actually applying for new credit.

You have the right to bring a civil action or submit to binding arbitration against a consumer reporting agency to enforce an obligation under the security freeze law after following specified dispute procedures and having received the necessary notice.

Avis biométrique

Veuillez prendre connaissance des informations ci-dessous avant de donner votre accord au Certn pour le traitement de vos données biométriques.

  

Les “données biométriques” sont des informations personnelles résultant d'un traitement technique spécifique relatif aux caractéristiques physiques, physiologiques ou comportementales qui permettent ou confirment l'identification unique de cette personne physique.

  

**Pourquoi avez-vous besoin de mes données biométriques ?**

  

Dans le cadre des services de vérification à distance des antécédents que nous fournissons à nos clients, nous collectons vos données biométriques pour (i) vérifier à distance votre identité, et (ii) prévenir et combattre la fraude.

  

**Comment cela fonctionne-t-il ?**

  

Nous vous demanderons de scanner une copie de votre pièce d'identité délivrée par le gouvernement et de prendre un selfie à l'aide de votre appareil mobile ou de votre ordinateur portable. Nous utilisons un algorithme d'intelligence artificielle pour mesurer certaines caractéristiques de votre visage sur la photo de votre pièce d'identité et sur votre selfie, et les comparer l'une à l'autre pour confirmer que la personne qui effectue la vérification des antécédents correspond à celle qui figure sur la pièce d'identité. Cela nous aide à lutter contre la fraude et à garantir que nous fournissons des informations exactes à nos clients.

  

**Qui aura accès à mes données biométriques ?**

  

Sauf si la loi l'exige, vos données biométriques ne sont accessibles qu'à nous et à nos fournisseurs de services qui ont besoin d'accéder aux données biométriques pour nous aider à fournir nos services. Nous ne partageons pas les données biométriques avec d'autres tiers. Cela dit, nous fournirons certaines informations vous concernant au client pour le compte duquel nous effectuons la vérification des antécédents, notamment des copies du document d'identité et de la photo que vous nous avez fournis, ainsi que la confirmation que nous avons été en mesure ou non de vérifier votre identité.

  

Le Certn ne vend pas, ne loue pas, n'échange pas et ne tire aucun profit de vos données biométriques.

  

**Comment protégez-vous mes données biométriques ?**

  

La société utilise des mesures de sécurité standard pour stocker et protéger vos données biométriques, conformément à notre politique de confidentialité. Sauf obligation légale, une fois votre identité vérifiée, nous supprimerons vos données biométriques de nos systèmes dans un délai de 30 jours.

  

Le lieu de stockage des données biométriques dépend de la localisation de notre client. Par exemple, si le client pour le compte duquel nous effectuons une vérification des antécédents est situé au Canada, vos données biométriques seront stockées au Canada. Si vous résidez dans un pays différent de nos sites de traitement ou de l'emplacement de notre client, nous pouvons transférer vos données biométriques dans le but de compléter la vérification d'identité, conformément à notre politique de confidentialité (https://certn.co/privacy-policy/) et aux lois applicables en matière de protection de la vie privée.

  

**Quels sont mes droits ?**

  

Vous pouvez choisir de ne pas consentir au traitement de vos données biométriques. Si vous choisissez de ne pas consentir à la vérification biométrique de l'identité, il se peut que nous ne soyons pas en mesure de traiter votre demande ou de fournir les résultats de la vérification à notre client.

  

Vous pouvez également

* révoquer votre consentement au traitement de vos données biométriques,
* demander une copie de vos données biométriques,
* demander des corrections à vos données biométriques, et
* demander la suppression de vos données biométriques,

  

à tout moment en nous contactant à l'adresse [privacy@certn.co](mailto:privacy@certn.co). Dès réception de la notification, nous informerons notre client au nom duquel nous effectuons la vérification des antécédents, et nous répondrons rapidement à votre demande.

  

Si vous souhaitez obtenir de plus amples informations sur la nature et la portée du traitement de vos données, veuillez contacter le responsable de la protection de la vie privée du Certn à l'adresse suivante : [privacy@certn.co](mailto:privacy@certn.co).

Remedying the Effects of Identity Theft

You are receiving this information because you have been notified a consumer reporting company that you believe that you are a victim of identity theft. Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name, Social Security number, date of birth, or other identifying information, without authority, to commit fraud. For example, someone may have committed identity theft by using your personal information to open a credit card account or to get a loan in your name. For more information, visit [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you specific rights when you are, or believe that you are, the victim of identity theft. Here is a brief summary of the rights designed to help you recover from identity theft.

1. You have the right to ask that nationwide consumer reporting companies place “fraud alerts” in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim of identity theft. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. As soon as the agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your file.

o Equifax: 1-800-525-6285; [www.equifax.com](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.equifax.com)

o Experian: 1-888-397-3742; [www.experian.com](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.experian.com)

o TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289; [www.transunion.com](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.transunion.com)

An initial fraud alert stays in you file for at least 90 days. An extended alert stays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security number. If you ask for an extended alert, you will also have to provide an identity theft report. An identity theft report includes a copy of a report you have files with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information about the identity theft report, visit [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) .

2. **You have the right to free copies of the information in your file (your “file disclosure”).**

An initial fraud alert entitles you to a copy of all the information in your file at each of the three nationwide agencies, and an extended alert entitles you to two free file disclosures in a 12-month period following the placing of the alert. These additional disclosures may help you detect signs of fraud, for example, whether fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name or whether someone has reported a change in your address. Once a year, you also have the right to a free copy of the information in your file at any consumer reporting agency, if you believe it has inaccurate information due to fraud, such as identity theft. You also havethe ability to obtain additional free file disclosures under other provisions of the FCRA. See [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore).

**3.** **You have the right to obtain documents relating to fraudulent transactions made or** **accounts opened using your personal information.** A creditor or other business must give you copies of applications and other business records relating to transactions and accounts that resulted from the theft of your identity, if you ask for them in writing. A business may ask you for proof of your identity, a police report, and an affidavit before giving you the documents. It also may specify an address for you to send your request. Under certain circumstances, a business can refuse to provide you with these documents. See [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) .

4\. You have the right to obtain information from a debt collector. If you ask, a debt collector must provide you with certain information about the debt you believe was incurred in you name by an identity thief - like the name of the credit and the amount of the debt.

**5.** **If you believe information in your file results from identity theft, you have the right to** **ask that a consumer reporting agency block that information from your file.** An identity thief may run up bills in your name and not pay them. Information about the unpaid bills may appear on your consumer report. Should you decide to ask a consumer reporting agency to block the reporting of this information, you must identity the information to block, and provide the consumer reporting agency with proof of your identity and a copy of your identity theft report. The consumer reporting agency can refuse or cancel your request for a block if, for example, you don’t provide the necessary documentation, or where the block results from an error or a material misrepresentation of fact made by you. If the agency declines or rescinds the block, it must notify you. Once a debt resulting from identity theft has been blocked, a person or business with notice of the block may not sell, transfer, or place the debt for collection.

**6.** You also may prevent businesses from reporting information about you to consumer reporting agencies if you believe the information is a result of identity theft. To do so, you must send your request to the address specified by the business that reports the information to the consumer reporting agency. The business will expect you to identify what information you do not want reported and to provide an identity theft report.

To learn more about identity theft and how to deal with its consequences, visit [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore), or write to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

You may have additional rights under state law. For more information, contact your local consumer protection agency or your state Attorney General.

In addition to the new rights and procedures to help consumers deal with the effects of identity theft, the FCRA has many other important consumer protections. They are described in more detail at [www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore](https://certn.co/terms-of-use/www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore) .

**Access to Dashboard**.

Certn will provide you with a dashboard that contains, among other things, requests for information, tasks to complete and a repository of completed background checks and verifications, including verifiable credentials, as defined below (“**Results**”). Certn does not, and cannot, provide legal advice or other related services to you. Certn also does not guarantee that any third party you consent to share your Results with will comply with applicable local, provincial, state or federal laws, rules, regulations, and requirements (“**Applicable Laws**”) in their collection or use of such Results.

While Certn strives to provide a reliable and accessible App, Certn does not guarantee uninterrupted access. Maintenance, updates, or unforeseen issues may temporarily impact the availability of the App.

The App is intended for personal and private use. If you use the App for commercial, business, or resale purposes, we will not be liable for any losses, including loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

To the extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for delays, delivery failures, or other loss or damage resulting from the transmission of data over communications networks, including the internet.

**Termination**.

Certn may terminate your access to the App and your Results at any time, with or without cause or notice. Upon termination, you agree to immediately cease using the App.

These Terms are subject to change from time to time. Certn will notify you of any material change within the App. Your continued use of the App will indicate your acceptance of the revised terms.

**Electronic Transaction**.

By using the Services you warrant that you have agreed to transact electronically through the App. You agree that an electronic signature is the legal equivalent of a manual signature.

**Governing Law**.

All matters relating to the Services and your access to, and use of, the App, will be governed by the laws in the province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

**Miscellaneous.**

Nothing contained in these Terms shall be construed as creating any employment, agency, partnership, franchise, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise or authority to bind the other party.

Certn shall not be responsible for any failure or delay in its performance under these Terms due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, labor disputes, strikes, lockouts, internet or telecommunications failures, shortages of or inability to obtain labor, energy, or supplies, war, terrorism, riot, acts of God or governmental action, pandemic, acts by hackers or other malicious third parties and problems with the Internet generally, and such performance shall be excused to the extent that it is prevented or delayed by reason of any of the foregoing.

Any waiver of a provision of these Terms will only be valid if provided in writing and applies only to the specific occurrence so waived. Failure to enforce any provision will not constitute a waiver.

In the event that any of the provisions in the Terms are held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, all other provisions will nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable with the invalid or unenforceable parts severed from the remainder of the Terms.

Certn may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes will be effective upon posting on the App. It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly.

**Support**.

You can request support via email sent to [support@certn.co](mailto:support@certn.co).

You consent to receive any agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications (collectively, “**Notices**”) to which these Terms refer electronically including without limitation by e-mail or by posting notices on the App. You agree that all Notices provided electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.
