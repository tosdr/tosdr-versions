Law Enforcement Information Request
===================================

SpiderOak is a No Knowledge privacy cloud technologies company enabling solutions for consumer, groups and enterprise that backup, sync, share, access and storage via the Internet. To submit legal process, [please begin here](https://spideroak.com/about/law-enforcement/legal-request/form). 

##### WHAT INFORMATION CAN SPIDEROAK ACCESS?

Due to SpiderOak’s No Knowledge privacy methodologies, the Company does not have plaintext access to any data a user uploads through the SpiderOak application. For account purposes, we do have access to the account details collected upon account creation including name, email address, and username. Further details include account type, date of account creation/deletion, account history, last 4 digits of credit card (if applicable) and billing address (if applicable).

##### WHAT PRINCIPLES DOES SPIDEROAK BELIEVE IN UPHOLDING?

We at SpiderOak believe that everyone has a right to privacy. Given this benchmark, we ensure any request for information from law enforcement has proper authority and verification. We very much view this level of scrutiny and observance as our responsibility and will follow all measures available to us to ensure proper procedure is being followed.

SpiderOak provides user information in response to law enforcement requests only in the event that SpiderOak is required to do so by law. Regarding non-public user information, SpiderOak requires that law enforcement must provide the proper and correct legal documents required to obtain information (e.g. a subpoena, court order, or warrant). SpiderOak investigates all requests to ensure they comply with the law.

It is SpiderOak policy to provide notice to a user about any law enforcement request unless prohibited from doing so by law.

##### HOW DOES SPIDEROAK RESPOND TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST?

Requests seeking user information must refer to a specific user account by an email address or username associated with the user’s SpiderOak account. SpiderOak will not provide information in response to a request that only references a user’s name or seeks general information about a SpiderOak user.

To obtain non-public information about a SpiderOak user, law enforcement requests must provide valid legal process for the type of information sought (e.g. a subpoena, court order, or warrant). SpiderOak will not disclose any information unless a valid search warrant has been issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause.

##### HOW CAN I CONTACT SPIDEROAK?

NOTE: While SpiderOak agrees to accept service of law enforcement requests by the aforementioned methods, neither SpiderOak nor its users waive any legal rights based on this accommodation.

Secure interactions and data  
integrity guaranteed.
