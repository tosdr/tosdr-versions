Terms & Conditions
==================

Affiliate Program Operating Agreement This Affiliate Program Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Hang My Ads ("Hang My Ads" or "we"), and you, ("you" or "Affiliate") the party submitting an application to become a Hang My Ads affiliate). The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement apply to your participation with affiliates.hangmytracking.com ("Affiliate Program"). Each Affiliate Program offer (an "Offer") may be for any offering by Hang My Ads or a third party (each such third party a "Client") and may link to a specific web site for that particular Offer ("Program Web Site"). Furthermore, each Offer may have additional terms and conditions on pages within the Affiliate Program and are incorporated as part of this Agreement. By submitting an application or participating in an Offer, you expressly consent to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1. #### Enrollment in the Affiliate Program
    
    You must submit an Affiliate Program application from our website. You must accurately complete the application to become an affiliate (and provide us with future updates) and not use any aliases or other means to mask your true identity or contact information. After we review your application, we will notify you of your acceptance or rejection to the Affiliate Program, generally within two (2) business days. We may accept or reject your application at our sole discretion for any reason.
    
2. #### Obligations of the Parties
    
    Subject to our acceptance of you as an affiliate and your continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Hang My Ads agrees as follows:
    
    1. We will make available to you via the Affiliate Program graphic and textual links to the Program Web Site and/or other creative materials (collectively, the "Links") which you may display on web sites owned or controlled by you, in emails sent by you and clearly identified as coming from you and in online advertisements (collectively, "Media"). The Links will serve to identify you as a member of our Affiliate Program and will establish a link from your Media to the Program Web Site.
        
    2. We will pay Affiliate for each Qualified Action (the "Commission"). A "Qualified Action" means an individual person who (i) accesses the Program Web Site via the Link, where the Link is the last link to the Program Web Site, (ii) is not a computer generated user, such as a robot, spider, computer script or other automated, artificial or fraudulent method to appear like an individual, real live person, (iii) is not using pre-populated fields (iv) completes all of the information required for such action within the time period allowed by Hang My Ads and (v) is not later determined by Hang My Ads to be fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate.
        
    3. We will pay you any Commissions earned monthly, provided that your account is currently greater than $0. Accounts with a balance of less than $0 will roll over to the next month, and will continue to roll over monthly until $0 is reached. We reserve the right to charge back to your account any previously paid Qualified Actions that are later determined to have not met the requirements to be a Qualified Action.
        
    4. Payment for Commissions is dependent upon Clients providing such funds to Hang My Ads, and therefore, you agree that Hang My Ads shall only be liable to you for Commissions to the extent that Hang My Ads has received such funds from the Clients. You hereby release Hang My Ads from any claim for Commissions if Hang My Ads has not received such funds from the Clients.
        
    5. Hang My Ads shall automatically generate an invoice on behalf of Affiliate for all Commissions payable under this Agreement and shall remit payment to Affiliate based upon that invoice. All tracking of Links and determinations of Qualified Actions and Commissions shall be made by Hang My Ads in its sole discretion. In the event that Affiliate disputes in good faith any portion of an invoice, Affiliate must submit that dispute to Hang My Ads in writing and in sufficient detail within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. If Affiliate does not dispute the invoice as set forth herein, then Affiliate agrees that it irrevocably waives any claims based upon that invoice. In the event that Affiliate is also tracking Qualified Actions and Affiliate claims a discrepancy, Affiliate must provide Hang My Ads with Affiliate's reports within three (3) days after 30th day of the calendar month, and if Hang My Ads's and Affiliate's reported statistics vary by more than 10% and Hang My Ads reasonably determines that Affiliate has used generally accepted industry methods to track Qualified Actions, then Hang My Ads and Affiliate agree to make a good faith effort to arrive at a reconciliation. If the parties are unable to arrive at a reconciliation, then Hang My Ads's numbers shall govern.
        
    6. If Affiliate has an outstanding balance due to Hang My Ads under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Affiliate and Hang My Ads, whether or not related to the Affiliate Program, Affiliate agrees that Hang My Ads may offset any such amounts due to Hang My Ads from amounts payable to Affiliate under this Agreement.
        
    
    Affiliate also agrees to:
    
    1. Have sole responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of, and all content on or linked to, your Media.
        
    2. Ensure that all materials posted on your Media or otherwise used in connection with the Affiliate Program (i) are not illegal, (ii) do not infringe upon the intellectual property or personal rights of any third party and (iii) do not contain or link to any material which is harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, sexually explicit, harassing, promotes violence, promotes discrimination (whether based on sex, religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability or age), promotes illegal activities (such as gambling), contains profanity or otherwise contains materials that Hang My Ads informs you that it considers objectionable (collectively, "Objectionable Content").
        
    3. Not make any representations, warranties or other statements concerning Hang My Ads or Client or any of their respective products or services, except as expressly authorized herein.

Affiliate agrees that failure to download the Suppression List and remove all emails from the database before mailing may result in Commission withholdings, removal or suspension from all or part of the Affiliate Program, possible legal action and any other rights or remedies available to Hang My Ads pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Affiliate further agrees that it will not mail or market to any suppression files generated through the Hang My Ads network, and that doing so may result in Commission withholdings, removal or suspension from the Affiliate Program, possible legal action and any other rights or remedies available to Hang My Ads pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.
            
        
    2. Advertising Campaigns. No Links can appear to be associated with or be positioned on chat rooms or bulletin boards unless otherwise agreed by Hang My Ads in writing.

Sub-processor shall extend the protections of the Agreement and this GDPR Addendum to any such Personal Data and limit any further processing of such Personal Data to only those limited purposes that require the retention.
    
    f) Data Processor acknowledges and agrees that Sub-processor may engage Subsequent Sub- processors in connection with the Services. Sub-processor will contractually impose data protection obligations on its Subsequent Sub-processors that are at least equivalent to those data protection obligations imposed on Sub-Processor. As between the Data Processor and Sub-processor, Sub- processor shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions of any Subsequent Sub-processor.
