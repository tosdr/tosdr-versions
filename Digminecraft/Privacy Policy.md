Privacy Policy
==============

Last updated Dec 23, 2019

Our Commitment to You
---------------------

DigMinecraft.com is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. It is important for you to understand what Personal Information we will collect, how we will use it and who may see it.

What is Personal Information?
-----------------------------

Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.

Personal Information Collection and Use
---------------------------------------

DigMinecraft.com requires no account creation or user registration to use our website. We do not collect any personal data from you such as your name, home address, email address or telephone number.

By accessing our website, the external IP address of your computer as well as http specific information will be stored and logged for statistical, verification and organizational purposes (in the EEA, Art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR, legitimate interests). Our website is designed to be used without indication of any additional personal data.
