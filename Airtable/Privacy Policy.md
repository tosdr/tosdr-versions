### a. Your Content

“**Content**” includes all information, data, and other content, in any form or medium, that is collected, downloaded, or otherwise received, directly or indirectly, from you (or on your behalf) by or through the Services. It also includes information you provide when connecting a third-party account, product, or service to the Services. You (and anyone who can interact with your use of the Services) own and control the nature of any Content, subject to any applicable terms and conditions including our [Terms of Service](https://www.airtable.com/tos) and this Privacy Policy. Our collection, use, and disclosure practices with respect to Content are distinct from those with respect to other sorts of information, as explained in [Section 2.a.](https://www.airtable.com/privacy#use-of-content) below.

We may upload Content automatically with your authorization from third-party services (such as from your Google Drive). See [Section 1.c.](https://www.airtable.com/privacy#third-party-integrations) below.

### b. Customer Information

“**Customer Information**” consists of information related to your access or use of our Services, the creation of accounts, or that otherwise identifies you as a customer or end user of the Services. Customer Information includes:

### c. Third-Party Integrations

If you create your account using a service provided by a third party such as Google or Apple, or a single-sign-on service provided by a third party such as Okta, we may collect Customer Information about you from the third-party service (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service). If you create your account using such a third-party service, or if you give us permission by changing the settings on your Airtable Account, we may also collect, and you authorize us to collect, information about your personal contacts as may be stored within that third-party service, which we may use to facilitate your invitation of collaborators to our Services. By choosing to create an account using a third-party service, you also authorize us to collect Customer Information necessary to authenticate your account with the third party.

Certain aspects of the Services allow you to link or integrate third-party products and services to enable certain features and functionalities with the Services. For example, you can connect your Google Drive account to generate Content in the Services from information and data contained in your Google Drive or integrate with third-party services using our applications or extensions. If you choose to use these features or functionalities, you may be asked to create an account with a third party that provides such features or functionalities or link your existing third-party service account with the Services (and, by doing so, agree to the privacy policy and/or terms and conditions of that third party). You may also be asked to authorize the Services to collect information from the third party on your behalf. We will then collect information (such as your username or user ID associated with that third-party service) from you and/or that third party as necessary to enable the Services to access your data and content stored with that third-party service. Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information you provided to us or was otherwise collected by the third-party service in accordance with the privacy practices of that third party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that we may retain, take possession of, delete, or deny you access to your Content if we believe, in our sole discretion, that some or all of your Content, or your use of the Services, violates our [Terms of Service](https://www.airtable.com/tos). We also may analyze metadata related to Content (such as total number of records, file size, API volume, access logs, etc.).

### b. Use of Other Information

3\. How We Disclose Information

* With third parties who enable certain features or functionalities of the Services that you’ve requested (for example, by installing extensions in the Services);
    
* With an employer or other organization (or employees or other users of the Services associated with such an employer or other organization) on whose behalf you use the Services, that created an Airtable Account on your behalf, or that owns, manages, or is associated with the email domain for an email address on your account;

5\. Retention of Information

We store your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal or reporting requirements, and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data; the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data; the purposes for which we process your personal data; and the applicable legal requirements.

6\. Managing Your Information

Unless otherwise expressly stated, all terms in this section have the same meaning as defined in the CCPA.

### a. Sensitive Personal Information

Certain data elements we collect and use to provide the Services may be deemed "sensitive personal information" under CCPA. These include your username and password to access your account and contents of any messages you send through our email integration feature. We do not use or disclose such sensitive personal information to “infer” characteristics as defined under the CCPA, or for any purpose other than that which is necessary to provide the Services as specified in the CCPA.

### b. Sales and Sharing of Personal Information (Targeted Advertising)

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies that enable certain advertising networks, social media companies, analytics services, and other third-party businesses to collect and disclose your personal information directly from your browser or device when you visit or interact with our Services or otherwise engage with us online. In some cases, we may upload personal information to certain of these partners for advertising or analytics purposes.

To opt out of these “sales” or “sharing” of personal information (as these terms are defined under the CCPA or other applicable US state privacy laws), you must:

* Toggle cookies off in our cookie preference center or enable Global Privacy Control (“**GPC**”) on your browser; and

Note that the above opt-out right does not apply where we have appropriately limited our partners to be our “service providers” or “processors” (as these terms are defined under the CCPA or other applicable US state privacy laws).

To learn more about GPC, please visit [http://globalprivacycontrol.org](http://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

### c. California Privacy Rights
