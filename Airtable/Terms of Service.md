### 1.3. Organizations

If you are an individual and you access or use our Services on behalf of a company, organization, principal, or other entity, such as your employer (each, together with its affiliates, an "**Organization**"), then: (i) these Terms are an agreement between us and you and us and that Organization; (ii) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms (and if you do not have the authority, you may not access or use our Services); (iii) your acceptance of these Terms will bind such Organization to these Terms; (iv) your individual right to access and use our Services may be suspended or terminated (and ownership and administration of your Airtable Account (defined below) may be transferred) if you cease to be associated with, or cease to use an email address associated with, owned by, or provisioned by, that Organization; (v) we may disclose information regarding you and your use of the Services, including Your Content (defined below), to such Organization, or to appropriate individuals associated with that Organization; and (vi) the terms “**you**” and “**your**”, as used in these Terms, refer to both you and such Organization.

### 6.2. Billing and Payment

For any paid Subscription Plan, you agree to make payments, and we may automatically charge your Payment Method, as described below, for so long as your Airtable Account remains active.

If your payment is not successfully settled for any reason, you remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to us, and you authorize us or our third-party service provider to continue to charge your Payment Method, without further notice, until such time as your payment is settled.

You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.

### 16.2. Arbitration

**READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.** This section 16.2 (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of our Services, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using our Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (“**Claim**” or collectively, “**Claims**”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.

If you are a new user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at [legal@airtable.com](mailto:legal@airtable.com) with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.

For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at [legal@airtable.com](mailto:legal@airtable.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim through binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “**Rules**”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/), where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or San Francisco, California, unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using our Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using our Services for non-commercial purposes: (a) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (b) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (c) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.

NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.

IF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL BE SEVERED. SEVERANCE OF THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH SHALL REMAIN IN FORCE, OR THE PARTIES’ ABILITY TO COMPEL ARBITRATION OF ANY REMAINING CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS PURSUANT TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM SEEKING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THEN ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO SUCH RELIEF (AND ONLY THAT RELIEF) MUST BE SEVERED FROM ARBITRATION AND MAY BE LITIGATED IN A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. ALL OTHER CLAIMS FOR RELIEF SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE ARBITRATED UNDER ITS TERMS, AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT LITIGATION OF ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHALL BE STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF ANY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION.

### 16.3. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED OUR SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
