Cookie Policy
=============

Created: December 1, 2022  
[FR](https://www.airtable.com/company/cookie-policy/fr) | [DE](https://www.airtable.com/company/cookie-policy/de)

This Cookie Policy describes the types of cookies and similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) used by Formagrid Inc, dba Airtable ("we," "our," or "us") on: (i) airtable.com, its subdomains, and any other website where Airtable’s [Terms of Service](https://www.airtable.com/tos) are posted; (ii) Airtable’s online hosted services; and (iii) Airtable’s “Software,” meaning, collectively, our browser extensions, mobile applications, other downloadable apps, application programming interfaces (“APIs”), and tools and documentation ((i) through (iii) collectively, our “Service” or “Airtable”).

1\. What are Cookies and why does Airtable use them?
----------------------------------------------------

Cookies are small text files stored by your web browser when you visit certain websites or mobile properties. We use Cookies in our Service for the purposes of facilitating your use of our Service, customizing your browsing experience, tracking usage trends and patterns, and delivering targeted ads.

2\. What types of Cookies does Airtable use?
--------------------------------------------

Our Service uses “first-party Cookies” (i.e., Cookies served by us) and “third-party Cookies” (i.e., Cookies served by third parties that we work with).

Cookies are unique to your account or your browser. Session-based Cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent Cookies last until you or your browser deletes them or until they expire.

Our uses of Cookies fall into the following general categories:

* _Strictly-Necessary_. We use Cookies that allow you access to our Service; are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity, and improve security; and allow you to make use of our functionality;
    
* _Functionality-Related_. We may use Cookies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Service, including, for example, identifying you when you sign into our Service or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;
    
* _Performance-Related_. We may use Cookies to assess the performance of our Service and, as part of our analytic practices, to help us understand how you use the Service;
    
* _Advertising- or Targeting-Related_. We may use first-party or third-party Cookies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests, on our Service or on third-party sites.
    

You can learn more about the Cookies we use on the Service [here](https://airtable.com/shrFlHNunBVYxVram/tbl7lUeYwgaPX1cBR).

3\. Does Airtable use Cookies for interest-based advertising?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. We work with third-party partners like online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services that use Cookies, or other information in connection with use of our Service, in order to display personalized or interest-based ads on the Service, on other websites, through apps or services you may use, and on other devices or browsers you may use. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, service optimization, and market research. These Cookies typically contain a pseudonymous cookie ID and collect device metadata, such as IP address and user agent string, and actions on the Service to assist with these advertising and related services. Please note that the information we share with those advertising networks might be combined with other information about you that those networks may have collected from us or other sources.

4\. How do I manage Cookies?
----------------------------

### a. How do I manage Cookies used by Airtable?

Depending on your region, a pop-up window may appear the first time you visit our Service, informing you that our Service uses Cookies, and allowing you to set your cookie preferences for your device. Please be aware that this does not apply to strictly-necessary Cookies. Even if the pop-up window does not appear, you may indicate or change certain preferences by visiting our

.

### b. How do I opt out of Google data collection?

We also may use certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Universal Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party Cookies (such as the Doubleclick advertising cookie) or other third-party Cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Service.

* You may opt out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at [google.com/ads/preferences](https://google.com/ads/preferences).
    
* You can view Google’s currently available Google Analytics opt-out options at [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    
* You may learn more about Google’s practices with Google Analytics by visiting Google’s privacy policy, currently available at [google.com/policies/privacy/partners](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners).
    

### c. How do I opt out via self-regulatory programs?

You can opt-out of advertising companies serving interest-based advertising to you by using the self-regulatory program opt-outs below (to the extent those companies participate in such industry opt-out pages).

* To opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for web properties or [https://youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices/) for mobile apps.
    
* To opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit [https://thenai.org/opt-out/](https://thenai.org/opt-out/).
    

Opting out via the above mechanisms does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It means that the online ads that you do see from these self-regulatory program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-party opt-out options or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding those options or programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under those self-regulatory programs.
