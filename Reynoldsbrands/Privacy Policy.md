The legal basis that we rely upon to Process your Personal Information will depend on the circumstances in which it is collected and used. In most cases, the legal basis will fall into one of the following categories where:

You have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting us.

**If You Fail to Provide Personal Information**

Where we need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have requested from us, but we will notify you if this is the case. 

1. How We Disclose Personal Information

Reynolds may disclose your Personal Information to any member of our group, which means our affiliates, subsidiaries, and our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries in compliance with applicable privacy principles, laws, regulations and rules.

To this effect, we may disclose Personal Information to the following:

* Entities who perform tasks on our behalf; and
* Entities who agree to provide adequate protections for your Personal Information that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy; and to use your information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by us.

Depending on where you are based, you may have certain Personal Information rights. We set these out below:

_Section 1 – Residents of California_ 

**Notice at Collection**

We may collect certain categories of Personal Information about you when you.  Please see [What Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It](#Section2) for a detailed description of the categories of Personal Information, including sensitive Personal Information.  We collect this information to provide the Sites and services to you, as described in more detail in [How We Use Personal Information](#Section3).  We will retain these categories of information as described in more detail in [Data Retention](#Section9).

In the last 12 months, we have collected personal identifiers, commercial information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, audio, electronic, visual or similar information, and inferences drawn from the above.  For job applicants, we also have collected education information and sensitive Personal Information.  We collect this information from you when you provide it to us and when you interact with our Sites and/or call centers.

_Section 2 – Residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia_

**Your Rights to Know and to Access Personal Information**

If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia, and want to know the Personal Information we have collected about you in the last 12 months, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us, and subject to our verification of that request, we will provide you with the following information:

* the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you;
* the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected;
* the business or commercial purpose for collecting, disclosing or selling, if applicable, the personal information;
* the categories of third parties with whom we have shared or sold, if applicable, your personal information; and
* the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. 

In addition to these disclosures, you may submit a verifiable consumer request up to two (2) times in a twelve (12)-month period for access to your Personal Information we have collected. When you submit an access request, you can ask us to deliver the information by mail or electronically. **If you elect to receive the information electronically, to the extent it is technically feasible for us to do so, we will provide it in a portable and readily useable format.**

In order to submit a verifiable consumer request, please visit the “How You Can Submit a Verifiable Consumer Request” section below.   

**Your Right to Correct** 

If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia and you want to correct inaccuracies in the Personal Information that we have collected, processed, or otherwise obtained about you in the last twelve (12) months, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us, and subject to our verification of that request, we will provide you with the opportunity to correct the inaccuracies, taking into account the purposes of processing the Personal Information.

**Your Right to Delete** 

If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia, and want us to delete the Personal Information we have collected from or about you, you can send us a verifiable consumer request requesting that we delete some or all of such information, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your request to delete, we will delete such Personal Information from our active records, unless an exception applies.  We will also notify any service providers and third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Information of your request. 

Deletion requests are subject to certain limitations. We are not required to delete information where we are permitted or required to retain it, such as for tax, or record keeping purposes, to process orders and transactions, and for solely internal uses consistent with your relationship with us. If we deny your request to delete based on any of these exceptions, we will inform you in writing of the reason.

**How to Submit a Request** 

For us to process a request to know, access, correct, or delete, it is necessary for us to verify your identity.  We will ask you to provide certain additional information about yourself, such as name, physical address, email address and phone number, or other identifying information, to compare to information we have on file for you to verify your identity. We cannot fulfil your request if we cannot verify your identity. It may take up to forty-five (45) days to fulfil your request. If we cannot complete your request within the initial forty-five (45) day period, we will notify you in writing within forty-five (45) days of your initial request. 

To request exercise one or more of your consumer rights, please submit a verifiable consumer request:

* 1-800 433-2244; or
* RCPCommunications@ReynoldsBrands.com

California, Colorado, or Connecticut residents may authorize another person (your “agent”) to submit a request on your behalf. We will also require that you provide us with information sufficient for us to verify that you have authorized this person to act for you and to verify your identity as provided above. 

Residents of Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia can appeal a decision regarding their consumer privacy requests by contacting us by email at [RCPCommunications@ReynoldsBrands.com](mailto:RCPCommunications@ReynoldsBrands.com).

**Your Right to Opt-Out of Selling or Sharing**  

We may disclose certain Personal Information to third parties, including third parties who may process your personal information for targeted advertising. These activities may be considered a “sale” or “share” under these state laws.  The categories of Personal Information we may “sell” or “share” are personal identifiers, commercial information, and Internet or other electronic network activity information.  We may disclose this information to advertising and marketing networks, and data analytics providers. If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia you have the right to opt-out of sharing your Personal Information with third parties for these purposes.  Email us at [RCPCommunications@ReynoldsBrands.com](mailto:RCPCommunications@ReynoldsBrands.com) with the “Request to Opt-Out” in the message.

**Your Right to Non-Discrimination**

We do not discriminate against consumers for exercising any of their rights with respect to their Personal Information.  If you are a consumer exercising any of your rights under this policy, we will not deny you goods or services; charge you different prices or rates for goods or services; or provide different levels or quality of goods or services to you.

_Section 2 UK and EU data subject rights_

**Your Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information**

If you are a data subject in the UK or the EU, you have the right to submit a data subject access request. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

We shall take steps to verify any request. This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

You may file more than one requests for access to your Personal Information, but if the number of requests is manifestly excessive, we have the right to refuse to comply. If you elect to receive the information electronically, to the extent it is technically feasible for us to do so, we will provide the requested information in a portable and readily useable format.

We try to respond to all verified requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

**Your Right to Delete**

You have the right to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 

**Your Right to Correct**

You have the right to request that any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you is corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. 

**Your Right to Object to the Processing of Your Personal Information**

You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may have compelling legitimate grounds to continue to process your information.

**Your Right to Restrict the Processing of Your Personal Information**

You have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: 

* If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
* Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.
* Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. 
* You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 

**Your Right to Request the Transfer of Your Personal Information**

You have the right to request the transfer of your Personal Information. If you make such a request, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Your Right to Withdraw Consent**

Where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information you have the right to withdraw this consent at any point. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**EU And UK Contact**

We have appointed the Deputy General Counsel, Reynolds Consumer Products, as the individual responsible for the UK and EU aspects of this privacy policy, in particular Reynolds’ compliance with the GDPR. If you are a UK or EU data subject, and you have any questions about this privacy policy or if you wish to exercise any of your data subject rights, please use the following contact details: RCP Privacy, Reynolds Consumer Products, 1900 West Field Court, Lake Forest, Illinois 60045, Attention: Law Department, or by email at [RCPLegalTeam@reynoldsbrands.com](mailto:RCPLegalTeam@reynoldsbrands.com).

1. **International Transfers for Individuals Outside the United States**

If you are based outside the US, we share your Personal Information with Reynolds business units/affiliates/subsidiaries. This will involve transferring your data outside the country or region where you are located. Whenever we transfer your Personal Information to the US, we will take reasonable steps to protect it, including by using contractual safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses, obtaining your consent, or using other lawful means to transfer the information. 

1. **Security and Data Integrity**

We take measures to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Once we have received your information, we will use reasonable procedures and security safeguards to protect it from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, however, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security and any transmission is at your own risk.
