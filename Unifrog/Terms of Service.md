**THE COMMON APP**

If your School has agreed that its Unifrog accounts will be integrated with the Common Application (the “**Common App**”), you will be able to access the Common App via the Unifrog Platform.

If you use the Common App via the Unifrog Platform, the provider of the Common App service (The Common Application, Inc.), will receive and process some of your personal information. For further details, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.unifrog.org/privacy-policy).

If you are a Teacher with lead responsibilities for submitting a student’s applications via the Common App (commonly referred to as a ‘Counselor’), and you use Unifrog's integration with the Common App, you must upload a PDF of the appropriate transcript for transmission with every school report, optional report, mid-year report and final report that you send via the Common App online. You understand that:

1. if transcripts will be mailed, Common App member institutions do not want to receive the associated Common App reports online;
2. uploading a blank document or a document promising to mail the transcript at a later time is not acceptable;
3. if you fail to send the appropriate transcript with any Common App online reports, this may cause confusion and processing delays, resulting in a late application decision for the relevant application, and your Common App online account may be closed; and
4. you agree that the provider of the Common App (The Common Application, Inc.) may contact you periodically regarding updates to the online school forms system, and will use the email address you use as your Unifrog username.

You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction except that if you are a resident in another jurisdiction, in which case you may also bring proceedings in your home jurisdiction.

In addition, please note that disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution platform:

**SEVERABILITY**

If any court or competent authority decides that any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the term will, to that extent only, be severed from the remaining terms, which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**MISCELLANEOUS**
