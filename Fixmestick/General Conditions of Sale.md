Returns & refunds for devices
-----------------------------

  

##### This article is for customers who bought a 30 day trial FixMeStick or StartMeStick, 1 year Home FixMeStick or StartMeStick, 2 year Home FixMeStick or StartMeStick or 1 year PRO FixMeStick for either Mac or PC via the FixMeStick/StartMeStick online store.

* If you didn’t buy your device or accessory on the online store (or over the phone via our customer support), contact the retailer where you purchased it for return information.
* * Retailers include Walmart, Best Buy, etc. as well as TV Shopping.

  

#### Refunds

We want you to love your device! If you aren’t satisfied with your purchase or you’re having trouble getting started please [contact](https://www.fixmestick.com/contact/) our support team, they’d love to help you get set up. We offer a 45 day money back guarantee on all of our non-Trial products. The 30 day trial is eligible for a refund (minus your shipping and handling fees) within the trial period.  
  
In order to receive a refund you’ll need to [contact](https://www.fixmestick.com/contact/) the FixMeStick Customer Support team. In all cases you will be refunded immediately to your original payment method following the confirmation email, with the refund appearing in your account in 5-7 business days depending on the speed at which your bank processes refunds. You are not required to return your FixMeStick/StartMeStick. You are required to tell us the code on the side of your device so it can be de-activated.

#### Renewals

The FixMeStick and StartMeStick are continuously and automatically updated with security and feature improvements (and the FixMeStick with information about the latest viruses and malware) so that you always have the latest version. They each require an annual subscription (just like antivirus programs) and are set to renew automatically on all Trial orders. A subscription on automatic renewal saves you money on each year's subscription.  
  
We make the auto-renew terms clear at the online checkout and on your order receipt. While we can't refund renewals, please do get in touch with us via email at [support@fixmestick.com](https://support.fixmestick.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you would like to change your subscription settings or have any other questions regarding your account.
