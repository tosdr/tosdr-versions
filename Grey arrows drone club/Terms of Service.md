Competitions held by Grey Arrows Drone Club are skills-based and require a question to be answered. Entrants who successfully answer a question are entered in to a prize draw. Grey Arrows Drone Club has a reasonable expectation that skill, judgment or knowledge of the prize is required to enter the competition. Entry to the Competition is only available to Club [members](https://greyarro.ws/faq#membership) residing in the UK with an active membership subscription.

Entry to a Competition can only be made online via [https://dronescene.co.uk/competitions](https://dronescene.co.uk/competitions) and ticket purchases can only be made using a debit or credit card.

Some Competitions are limited to one ticket purchase, other competitions have no limit on the number of tickets you may purchase. A maximum of 99 tickets can be purchased in any one transaction. Multiple transactions of ticket purchases are allowed where the Competition permits.

Each Competition has a Start Date, an End Date and a Draw Date. Tickets may only be purchased during the period between the Start Date and the End Date of the Competition.

Prizes are non-transferable and no cash alternative prize is available.

Entrants who successfully answer a question will have their ticket(s) entered in to a prize draw to choose a winner. The more tickets purchased by an individual, the higher the odds of winning the prize draw. The prize draw will be held live, online.
