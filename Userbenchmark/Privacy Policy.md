[Why does UserBenchmark have a bad reputation on reddit?](#tff_1)

Marketers operate countless reddit accounts. UserBenchmark challenges their narrative so they attack our reputation with a co-ordinated charade.

[Why don’t PC brands endorse UserBenchmark?](#tff_2)

PC brands make a lot of profit on flagships like the 4090, 14900KS, and 7950X3D. We help users get similar real-world performance for less money.

[Why don’t youtubers promote UserBenchmark?](#tff_3)

We don't pay youtubers, so they don't praise us. Moreover, UserBenchmark's data exposes the youtubers that promote overpriced/inferior products.

[Why does UserBenchmark have negative trustpilot reviews?](#tff_4)

[The 200+ reviews on trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.userbenchmark.com) are mostly written by virgin marketing accounts. Real users aren't incentivized to back brands.

[Why is UserBenchmark popular with users?](#tff_5)

Instead of chasing sponsorship with billion-dollar PC brands, we've dedicated 13 years to publishing real-world data which collectively saves our users millions.

The Best.
