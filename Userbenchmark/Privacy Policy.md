[Why does UserBenchmark have a bad reputation on reddit?](#tff_1)

Marketers operate thousands of reddit accounts. Our benchmarks expose their spiel so they attack our reputation.

[Why don’t PC brands endorse UserBenchmark?](#tff_2)

Brands make boatloads on flagships like the 4090 and 14900KS. We help users get similar real-world performance for less money.

[Why don’t youtubers promote UserBenchmark?](#tff_3)

We don't pay youtubers, so they don't praise us. Moreover, our data obstructs youtubers who promote overpriced or inferior products.

[Why does UserBenchmark have negative trustpilot reviews?](#tff_4)

[The 200+ trustpilot reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.userbenchmark.com) are mostly written by virgin marketing accounts. Real users don't give a monkey's about big brands.

[Why is UserBenchmark popular with users?](#tff_5)

Instead of pursuing brands for sponsorship, we've spent 13 years publishing real-world data for users.
