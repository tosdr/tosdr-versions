OpenWeb Cookie Policy
=====================

Last revised at: Dec 19th 2019

OpenWeb uses certain monitoring and tracking technologies, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, and scripts (collectively, “**Cookies**”). These technologies are used in order to maintain, provide, and improve our website and services (the “**Services**”), and in order to provide our users with a better experience (for instance, in order to track users’ preferences, to better secure our Services, to identify technical issues, and to monitor and improve the overall performance of our Services).

This page contains information on what Cookies are, the Cookies used on our Services, how to switch Cookies off in your browser, and some useful links for further reading on the subject. If it does not provide the information you were looking for, or you have any further questions about the use of Cookies on our Services, please email [privacy@openweb.com](mailto:privacy@spot.im).

For more information about our general privacy practices, please visit our Privacy Policy

What Are Cookies?
-----------------

**Performance Cookies:** This type of cookie helps us to secure and maintain our Services, and remembers your preferences for tools found on the Services, so you don’t have to re-set them each time you visit.

**Analytics Cookies:** Every time someone visits our Services, the analytics services we use generate Cookies which can tell us whether or not you have visited the Services in the past, and provide additional information regarding how our users use our Services (such as where users tend to click on our Services). Your browser will tell us if you have these Cookies and, if you don’t, we generate new ones. This allows us to track how many individual users we have and how often they visit the Services.

Unless you are signed into our Services, we cannot use these Cookies to identify individuals. We use them to gather statistics. For example, the number of visits to a page.

**Registration Cookies:** When you register and sign into our Services, we generate Cookies that let us know whether you are signed in or not.

Our servers use these Cookies to work out which account you are signed in with and if you are allowed access to a particular service.

While you are signed into our Services, we have the ability to combine information from your registration Cookies with analytics Cookies, which we can use to identify which pages you have seen.

**Marketing & Advertising Cookies:** These Cookies allow us to know whether or not you’ve seen an ad or a type of ad, how you interacted with such an ad, and how long it has been since you’ve seen it.

We also use Cookies to help us with targeted advertising. We may use Cookies set by another organization, so we can more accurately target advertisements to you.

We also set Cookies on certain other sites that we advertise on. If you receive one of those Cookies, we may use it to identify you as having visited that site if you later visit our Services. We can then target our advertisements based on this information.

**Third Party Integration Cookies:** On some pages of our Services, other organizations may also set their own Cookies. They do this to track the performance of their applications that are integrated with our Services or to customize their services for you. Because of how Cookies work, our website cannot access these Cookies, nor can the other organization access the data in Cookies we use on our Services.

Which Cookies do we use?
------------------------

We store Tracking Technologies when you visit or access our Services (for example when you are visiting our websites) – these are called “First Party Tracking Technologies”. In addition, Tracking Technologies are stored by other third parties (for example our analytics service providers, business partners and advertisers) who run content on our Services – these are called “Third Party Tracking Technologies”.

Both types of Tracking Technologies may be stored either for the duration of your visit on our Services or for repeat visits.

What types of Tracking Technologies do we use?
----------------------------------------------

There are five main types of Tracking Technologies:

### **1.Strictly necessary Tracking Technologies**

These Tracking Technologies are essential to enable you to login, navigate around and use the features of our Services, or to provide a service requested by you (such as your username). We do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these Tracking Technologies. These Tracking Technologies can be used for security and integrity reasons – for example to detect violation of our policies and for support or security features.

### **2\. Functionality Tracking Technologies**

These Tracking Technologies allow our Services to remember choices you make (such as your language) and provide enhanced and personalized features. For example, these Tracking Technologies are used for authentication (to remember when you are logged-in) and support other features of our Services.

### **3\. Performance Tracking Technologies**

These Tracking Technologies collect information about your online activity (for example the duration of your visit on our Services), including behavioral data and content engagement metrics. These Tracking Technologies are used for analytics, research and to perform statistics (based on aggregated information).

### **4\. Marketing or Advertising Tracking Technologies**

These Tracking Technologies are used to deliver tailored offers and advertisements to you, based on your derived interests, as well as to perform email marketing campaigns. They can also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by our advertisers (for example advertising networks) and provide them insights about the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites or use their app.

### **5\. Social Media Tracking Technologies**

Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” or “Share” buttons. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing these features.

6\. Our practices with respect to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals
------------------------------------------------------------

DNT signals are the result of a standardization initiative from 2009 to create a standard signal which could be broadcasted by any web browser, and read by any website publisher/operator, to note an individual’s preference not to be tracked online.  

While the working group assigned to this standardization initiative by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was disbanded in 2019, the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) still requires website publishers/operators to disclose whether they respond to web browsers’ ‘do not track’ (DNT) signals.  

OpenWeb does not change its practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from a browser, as unfortunately these are, from a technical perspective, not sufficiently reliable or standardized for us to warrant full adherence.

We do recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, but if you choose to remove or block them we definitely respect your choice. Modern web browsers typically allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them. You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies entirely through your browser settings.
