1. **Data Collection, Sources & Use**

We collect data regarding our Visitors, Publishers and Advertisers. Such data is typically collected and generated through your interaction with our Sites, through automatic means, directly from you, or from other third parties. Specifically, we collect the following categories of data (which, to the extent it relates to an identified or identifiable individual, will be deemed as “personal data“):

* _Prospect contact details_ – such as name, telephone number, email address, location (country, city), your position and other information that might be relevant for our further growth and business relationship. We collect such details to communicate with you, provide you with the Services, products or demonstrations that you might request, customize the Services for you, improve and enhance our Services, market our Services to you and facilitate, sponsor, and offer certain events and promotions; 

* _Account information for your business account_ – such as username, password, product interaction, feedback and any other information you choose to include in communications with us or arising from your use of the Services. We collect this information to provide you with the Services, authenticate your identity, secure your account with us, personalize the Services for you, communicate with you, administer the relationship between our companies, improve and enhance our Services, and conduct research and analytics. 

* _Data automatically collected and generated –_ such data mainly consists of connectivity, technical and aggregated usage data, such as IP addresses, data regarding the device, operating system, browser version, and locale settings used when interacting with the Sites, the cookies and pixels installed on such device and your activity (clicks and other interactions) in connection with our Services.  

* _Data received from our Publishers and Advertisers_ _–_ such data consists of name, role_,_ company and work or personal contact details, as relevant, however additional data may be provided at the Publisher’s or Advertiser’s discretion. Our Publishers and Advertisers may provide us with this data concerning their colleagues or employees so we could contact them to offer or provide them with our Services. 

Publishers and Advertisers may provide us additional information concerning their business, such as their payment information, billing details, business needs and preferences. Where such data concerns a non-human entity, we will not regard it as “personal data” and this Privacy Policy will not apply to it.

* _Data received from other third parties:_ we may receive your personal data from other sources. For example, if you participate in an event or webinar that we sponsor or participate in, we may receive your personal data from the event organizers. We may also receive your contact and professional details (e.g., your name, company, position, contact details and professional experience, preferences and interests) from our business partners or services providers, and through the use of tools and channels commonly used for connecting between companies and individuals in order to explore potential business and employment opportunities, such as LinkedIn, data enrichment and other networking or sourcing services.

In addition, we use personal data as necessary for the performance of our Services; to comply with applicable law; and to support our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving our Services and offerings, understanding how our Services are used, optimizing our marketing, advertising, customer service and support operations, and protecting and securing you, ourselves and our Services, as well as members of the general public.

If you reside or are interacting with us or with our Services in a territory governed by privacy laws under which “consent” is the only or most appropriate legal basis for processing personal data (in general, or specifically with respect to the types of personal data you choose to share), your acceptance of our [Terms of Use](https://www.openweb.com/legal-and-privacy/terms-of-use/) and of this Privacy Policy will be deemed as your consent to the processing of your personal data for all purposes detailed in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to revoke such consent, please contact us by e-mail at [privacy@openweb.com](mailto:privacy@openweb.com).

Further, we use personal data for the following purposes:

* To facilitate, operate, and provide our Services;
* To authenticate your identity, and to allow you access to our Services;
* To provide you with assistance and support;
* To further develop, customize and improve the Services and your experience, based on common or personal preferences, experiences and difficulties;
* To facilitate and optimize our marketing campaigns, ad management and sales operations, and to manage and deliver advertisements for our products and services more effectively, including on other websites and applications. Such activities allow us to highlight the benefits of using our Services, and thereby increase your engagement and overall satisfaction with our Services.
* To contact you with general or personalized service-related messages and calls, and promotional messages and calls (as further described in Section 6 below); and to facilitate, sponsor and offer certain events and promotions;
* To support and enhance our data security and content compliance measures, including for the purposes of preventing and mitigating the risks of fraud, abuse, error or any illegal or prohibited activity;
* To create aggregated statistical data, inferred non-personal data or anonymized or pseudonymized data (rendered non-personal), which we or our business partners may use to provide and improve our respective services; and
* To comply with any applicable laws and regulations.

2. **Data Sharing**

In certain instances, we may share your personal data with third parties, as described below: 

* _Third-party service providers_: companies that perform services on our behalf and complementary to our own (e.g. data hosting, analytics, advertising and marketing, data and cyber security, payment processors, user engagement services, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, text messaging services, and our business, legal and financial advisors) (collectively, “**Service Providers**“);
* With our affiliates or otherwise within our corporate group; 
* To comply with applicable law or any obligations thereunder, including cooperation with law enforcement, judicial orders, and regulatory inquiries;
* In connection with an asset sale, merger, bankruptcy, or other business transaction; 
* To enforce any applicable terms of use or service;
* To ensure the rights, interests, safety, health and security of OpenWeb, you, our Publishers, Advertisers, personnel and users.

For the avoidance of doubt, we may share your personal data in additional manners, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally obligated to do so, or if we have successfully rendered such data non-personal and anonymous.

3. **Data Location & Retention**

_Data Location_: We and our authorized Service Providers maintain, store and process personal data in the United States, the European Union, Israel and other locations as reasonably necessary for the proper performance and delivery of our Services, or as may be required by law.
