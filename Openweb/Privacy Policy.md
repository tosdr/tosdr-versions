    * We may also disclose your Personal Data to Publishers to whom we provide our Services, for example for analytics reporting and monitoring purposes.

We may also disclose your Personal Data when requested by legal or regulatory authorities in response to a verified request relating to terror acts, criminal investigations or similar illegal activity, or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other user to legal liability, and solely to the extent necessary to comply with such purpose.
* **Mergers and Acquisitions**: We may use and disclose any of the Personal Data In connection with any merger, sale, transfer of any of our assets, investment, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar event or any corporate transaction.

This information may be collected, processed and analyzed by us and transferred in a combined, collectively and aggregated manner (i.e., your information is immediately aggregated with other users) to third parties.

When disclosing Personal Data to third parties, they are required to secure the Personal Data they receive and to use that Personal Data only in compliance with all applicable data protection regulations (such service providers may use other Non-Personal Data for their own benefit).

3. **Tracking Technologies**

Our Services utilize “cookies,” anonymous identifiers, pixels and other technologies. A “cookie” is a small piece of information that a website assigns and stores on your computer while you are viewing it. You can find more information about cookies at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). These tracking technologies help us provide our Services, secure and improve them, personalize your experience and monitor the performance of our activities and campaigns. We recommend the use of cookies, but if you choose to remove or block them, we will respect your choice. You may opt out our cookie preferences tool, please contact us at privacy@openweb.com.

A list of the cookies we use, information concerning our Advertisers, their policies as well as additional information about cookies, including our support of transparency and control initiatives and your opt-out options, can be found [here](https://www.openweb.com/legal-and-privacy/cookie-policy/).

Any of the cookies we may place on Properties are ultimately controlled by such Publisher. Most Publishers typically allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept or remove them. We recommend you review the cookie policy of the respective Publisher to learn more about their practices.

Please note that in some cases, opting out of cookies, removing cookies, or completely blocking them, will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us, but it will affect the types of Ads that you will see. These ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).

Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals: Your browser settings may also allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal when you visit various websites. Like many websites, our Services are not specifically designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers. To learn more about “Do Not Track” signals, you can visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

4. **Data Subject Rights**

We acknowledge that different people have different privacy concerns and preferences. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. 

If you wish to exercise your privacy rights under applicable law, including the GDPR, UK GPDR or US data protection laws, please follow the instructions available on our dedicated GDPR & US Privacy Notices, as applicable to you, or contact us by email at [privacy@openweb.com](mailto:privacy@openweb.com).

Please note that once you contact us by e-mail, we may require additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, in order to authenticate and validate your or your authorized agent’s identity and to process your request. Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g., as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with this Policy.

5. **Data Security**

We work hard to protect the Personal Data we process from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We are using industry-standard physical, administrative and technical security measures to protect your Personal Data held with us, including by vendor security assessments, penetration testing, minimizing the amount of data that we store on our servers, restricting access to Personal Data by OpenWeb employees, contractors, agents, and encryption as appropriate. 

However, please be aware that regardless of any security measures used, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of any personal data stored with us or with any other third party. You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet and that there is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of your Personal Data or other content you transmit using the Service, and you do so at your own risk. Thus, we encourage you to exercise discretion regarding the Personal Data you choose to disclose.

6. **Data Retention**

We may retain Personal Data about you for as long as your account is active or as long as needed for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including to provide you with our Services.

We may also retain and use Personal Data about you to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our terms and conditions, other applicable terms of service, and our policies. If you stop using our Services, we may store your data in an aggregated and anonymized format, in which case, we may use this data for a longer period without further notice to you. 

Please note that except as required by applicable law, we will not be obligated to retain your Personal Data for any particular period, and we are free to securely delete it for any reason and at any time, with or without notice to you. If you have any questions about our data retention policy, please contact us by sending an email to [privacy@openweb.com](mailto:privacy@openweb.com).

7. **Communications**

For example, we may notify you, through any of the means available to us, of changes or updates to our Services, password reset requests, etc. Typically, you will not be able to opt-out of receiving such service communications while using our Services, as they are integral to such use.

We may also send you messages and other updates about new features, offering, events and special opportunities, as well as information which relate to your interaction with the Service (likes, comments, etc.). If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may notify OpenWeb at any time by changing your communications preferences in your account, by following the “unsubscribe”, “stop”, “opt-out” or “change e-mail preferences” instructions contained in the communications you receive, or by sending an email to [privacy@openweb.com](mailto:privacy@openweb.com).

Our Services allow individuals to comment and upload content to the Services, which others may engage and interact with. Such content may include messages, photos, etc. and may also include Personal Data (“**User-Generated Content**” or “**UGC**”). We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use UGC, and may or may not attribute it to you. Given the nature of our Services, others who have access to UGC may have the ability to share it with third parties. If you choose to submit UGC to the Services, your UGC, including any Personal Data contained therein, will be considered “public” and will be accessible by anyone.

Please note that we do not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make available to others, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on our Services or on the Properties, or what others do with information you share with them on such platforms.
