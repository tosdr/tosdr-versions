Telefon: +49 (941) 890 5500  
**[\[email protected\]](https://www.owayo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

hereinafter referred to as “owayo”.

1.2. All deliveries from owayo to the Customer are carried out based exclusively on these General Terms and Conditions given below.

1.3. The Customer's business or purchase terms are herewith expressly rejected.

2.2.1. Stock items are those products that the Customer may acquire from owayo without making any individual adjustments of its own to them.

2.2.2. By completing and sending off the order form on the internet for stock items, the Customer submits a binding offer for the conclusion of a contract of purchase by clicking the button “Order with obligation to pay”. The ordering process can be aborted at any time prior to finalizing the order by closing the browser window.

2.2.3. owayo can accept an order within 7 working days by either sending a separate order confirmation or by delivering the order. owayo may reject any order – for example after reviewing the Customer’s creditworthiness or the latter’s offer for its legal and effective feasibility, in particular for any possible infringement upon trademark rights of third parties.

2.2.4. owayo shall send an automatic order confirmation via e-mail to the Customer immediately subsequent to receipt of the order. The order confirmation does not represent an acceptance of the offer.

2.2.5. All orders for stock items received by email or telephone will also be acknowledged and confirmed by owayo without delay. The order acknowledgement does not represent a binding acceptance of the offer, unless it is explicitly declared by owayo to do so.

2.3.2. owayo shall send the Customer by e-mail a control design, including a cost estimate, and shall quote the delivery conditions. The Customer shall be required to review the control design, cost estimate and terms of delivery and may then confirm the offer made by owayo therein within two weeks of receipt thereof in writing or per email. By paying in advance for the order's value in full, the customer agrees and confirms the order and contract thereof. Upon receipt of this confirmation, the contract between the Customer and owayo shall come into being and Customer will receive a brief confirmation email.

#### 3\. Prices and Delivery/Shipping Costs
