Privacy Policy
==============

LUMA ENERGY, LLC – PRIVACY POLICY
---------------------------------

LUMA Energy, LLC (“LUMA”) is committed to protecting your privacy and to protecting all personal and non-personal information we may collect from you while doing business and providing our services. We explain below what information we collect, what we do with this information, who we share it with, and under what circumstances. Please review this policy before using our website, mobile applications, social networks, messaging services, emails and chat services (collectively, our “Online Services”). Your use of the Online Services implies your consent to this policy. If you do not agree with this policy as a whole, or any part of it, please discontinue your use of our Online Services.

### Who we are

LUMA operates Puerto Rico’s electricity transmission and distribution system. LUMA’s affiliates include, but are not limited to, LUMA Energy ServCo, LLC and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.

### How can you access our Online Services?

You can access our Online Services through our website and our mobile application (“App”).

Our website is available at [www.lumapr.com](https://www.lumapr.com/) and is divided into a public section and a private section. The public section of the website provides relevant general information that people may access without creating sign in credentials and without providing us any personal information. We do not collect any personal information from your interaction with the public website section. We may collect non-personal information from your device using cookies and/or other tracking mechanisms, but this information cannot be used to identify you.

The private section of the website provides personal electric service account information such as your account number, energy consumption, bills, and payments, among others, and provides several tools to manage your electric service accounts. To access the private website section, you must first register to create sign in credentials, including a username and a password. For that purpose, we will request your electric service account number among other personal information in order to identify you and authenticate you as the rightful owner of the electric service accounts that the private website section will present you.

For your convenience, we also provide an App to manage your electric service accounts. You can access the App by downloading it from the App Store in Apple devices or from the Google Play Store in Android or Google-based devices. The App provides its service by connecting to the private website section. Thus, if you created sign in credentials for the private website section, you can use the same sign in credentials to access the App. Otherwise, the process to gain access to the App is identical to the process to access the private website section; that is, the App will request some personal information to authenticate you and then you will create sign in credentials for access. The App may also use some of the authentication features of your device, such as touch-ID and face-ID.

In addition, we offer social media channels in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Through these channels we also provide relevant general information that people may access without providing us any personal information. These channels allow user generated content in the form of comments, images and videos which must adhere to our Terms and Conditions. We will never request any personal information through any of these channels as they are not secure channels of communication.

The table that follows describes each piece of personal information we request in order to provide you our Online Services, tells you why we need it, how we collect it, and if we store it and how.

### What personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

We may request personal information from you when you create sign in credentials in order to use the Online Services or when you contact us to request information or to request a service from us.

### About our email marketing program

When we collect your email address as part of the registration process or through any other contact you have with us, we will enroll it in our email marketing program. However, if you prefer not to receive our emails, you may modify your email preferences or unsubscribe using the links provided on our emails. This will remove your email from our marketing list, but you will still receive emails related to your service.

### What non-personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

In addition to the personal information listed in the table above, we may collect non-personal information from the device you use. This non-personal information cannot be used to identify you and it may be automatically collected from your device using cookies or other tracking mechanisms. This information may include the IP (Internet Protocol) address, internet service provider, cellular service provider, type of device (whether it is a smartphone, tablet, PC or other device), device characteristics, operating system, browser, referring URLs, time and date stamps, language preferences, country and location information (if you have granted your device permission to share it) among others. You can control the level of access granted to cookies, but, if you refuse access to cookies, some aspects of our Online Services may fail to work optimally.

This non-personal information is used for troubleshooting, to maintain the security and healthy operation of our Online Services, for website and App analytics (analytics refers to our efforts to understand the traffic to our Online Services and how they are used), and to establish session IDs, which are unique numbers assigned to you during your visits to keep track of your activity and to remember your actions. We collect this information to make it easier and faster for you to use our Online Services. None of this automatically collected information can be used to identify you; it simply helps us improve our Online Services.

### With whom do we share your personal information and why?

We do not sell, share, rent or trade your personal or non-personal information to third parties. We only disclose personal information to the groups identified below for the purposes stated below.

| Shared with | Purpose |

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect any personal or non-personal information we handle.
