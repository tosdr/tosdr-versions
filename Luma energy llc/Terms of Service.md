11. **Right to delete content.** Except as described in our Privacy Policy, we will not monitor, edit, or disclose the content of a user’s email or content posted on the Services unless necessary in the course of normal maintenance of the Services and their systems or unless required by law or if LUMA understands that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with a legal process notified to LUMA or the Services; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of LUMA, the Services or users of the Services; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our users, the Services or the public.

LUMA does not control this Content. You agree that under no circumstances will you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, LUMA’s endorsement of user posted Content. LUMA is not responsible for the accuracy or credibility of any Content posted by you on our Services or User Contributions posted through our Services, and assumes no responsibility for any actions you may take as a result of reviewing such user posted Content or User Contributions. By using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate, or misleading. There may also be risks of dealing with people who act with false pretensions. By using our Services, you assume all associated risks.
13. **Third-party links.**  From time to time, the Services may contain links to websites that are not owned, operated or controlled by LUMA or its affiliates. All of these links are provided solely for your convenience. You understand and agree that, if you use these links, you will be leaving the Services or LUMA’s Internet and properties. Neither we nor any of our affiliates are responsible for any content, material or other information located or accessible from any other website. Neither we nor any of our affiliates endorse, warrant, or make any representations or warranties with respect to other websites, or any content, materials or other information located or accessible from any other website, or the results you may obtain when using any other website. If you choose to access other websites linked from this Service, you do so at your own risk.
14. **Transactional partners.** In some cases, we may partner with another entity to jointly promote its services within our Services, or for that entity to provide some service to our users (e.g., payment processing or emailing). In these cases, you may transact directly with the other party. On those websites or locations, the transactional partner’s brand will be clearly visible and the terms of use of the transactional partner will be published. By using these associated websites, you will be bound by the partner’s terms of use in addition to remaining bound by these Terms.
15. **Electronic notifications.** As part of the Services, you will have the option to subscribe to receive your invoices, statements and any other documentation and communications in electronic form  (“Electronic Notifications”). Once you subscribe to receive Electronic Notifications, including billing, you consent to all notifications being sent to you exclusively electronically. With respect to communications between you and LUMA through electronic means, including LUMA digital platforms and emails to or from LUMA, you (1) agree to receive communications from LUMA electronically and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications provided to you electronically satisfy any legal requirements that such communications would meet if they were in writing. You are responsible for ensuring that the method of receipt of Electronic Notifications you have provided to LUMA, including email address, telephone number for text messages, and user information for the Services, is correct and kept up to date. You are also responsible for making sure these electronic receipt methods are working properly so that you receive notifications in a timely manner. If you are using an email mailbox, it is recommended that you include LUMA among your contacts or secure senders to prevent sent messages from being blocked or identified as _spam._ You are responsible for contacting LUMA if you are not receiving or have problems accessing your invoice or other Electronic Notifications. LUMA shall not be liable in any way for any failure to notify or late notification, or any effects that this may have or cause. If you wish to withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Notifications at any time, you must follow the procedure set out in the Services to unsubscribe. Cancellation may not be immediately registered, so you should contact LUMA if you do not receive your invoice or other notifications in a timely manner.
16. **Payment of invoices and charges.** As part of the Services, you will have the option to pay your bill and other charges related to the electrical power service to LUMA through LUMA’s website or mobile applications. Before making a payment, you will need to make sure that your registration details are correct. You are responsible for making the information you enter, including account numbers and amounts payable, correct, and you must ensure that payments made are properly recorded and contact LUMA immediately if you identify any errors in the processing of your payment. You are also responsible for making your payments well in advance to register before your due date and for finding alternative ways to make your payments on time if any of the Services are unavailable. The availability, timeliness and proper functioning of the Services depends on many factors beyond LUMA’s control, including the availability of Internet service, wireless network, cellular signal strength and proper functioning and proper configuration of the device in use, equipment and programming, so LUMA does not guarantee that the Services will operate without interruption or that you can complete your transaction, as there is always the possibility of errors in any of the components of the system chain that makes it possible to provide the Services. You will not be relieved of late payment charges or suspension of your electric service as a result of a payment not being completed due to unavailability of the Services. LUMA shall not be liable in any way for payments made incorrectly or late, including if a full or partial credit is not registered due to incorrect information being entered or if you do not have the opportunity to make payments through the Services due to these services not being available on a temporary manner. Any claim will be subject to these Terms, the terms and conditions of your electric power service agreements and any applicable regulations.
17. **Objections to invoices and charges.** As part of the Services, you will have the option to object to invoices and other charges related to your electrical power service to LUMA through LUMA’s website or mobile applications. You are responsible for making the information you submit by electronic means complete, correct and timely, and you must ensure that your objection is duly recorded. Objections will be handled in accordance with applicable legal regulations.
18. **Requests.** Whenever the Services provide the option to make a request to LUMA electronically, including requests for account transfer, disconnection, repair of service interruptions or certifications, you will be responsible for providing complete, correct and timely information to process your request. LUMA will not be liable for requests that cannot be processed due to incomplete or incorrect information.
19. **Map of service interruptions.**   LUMA provides a service outage map that provides the user the opportunity to report a service interruption or outage using geolocation tools. You are responsible for verifying that geolocation is correctly identified. LUMA shall not be liable in any way for incomplete or incorrect information on this map.
20. **Risk of fraud by unauthorized third parties.** Despite LUMA’s security and data protection measures, the Services are not exempt from fraudulent practices carried out by third parties not authorized by LUMA, including, but not limited to, cloning of web pages, phishing, spear phishing, malware, ransomware and  data breaches_._ LUMA shall not be liable in any way for content, materials, information, communications, cyberattacks, identity theft, diversion of funds by deception, unlawful appropriation or any other damage that may result from these fraudulent practices. You acknowledge that you access the Services at your own risk. LUMA urges its Users to educate themselves on such practices and to be attentive to alerts about fraud schemes published by LUMA, by government entities and by reliable means of communication so that they can identify these practices and protect themselves. LUMA also encourages Users who suspect that any activity, content, link or communication related to the Services may constitute a fraudulent practice to immediately contact LUMA to verify or report it, and thus avoid being victims of fraud.
21. **Termination.**  LUMA may suspend or terminate your right to use these Services at any time, for any reason or for no reason. We may also block your access to our Services in the event that (a) you breach these Terms; (b) we are not able to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause financial loss or legal liability to you, our users or us. You may decide to discontinue your use of the Services at any time.
