### How We Disclose Your Personal Data

 

* At times we may make certain personal data available to other companies that are controlled by or under common control with us ( **“Affiliates”** ) and other third parties that work with us in order to provide Services to you. Your personal data will not be shared with third parties for their own independent marketing purposes. We may share your personal data according to the following:
* • **Affiliates:** Your personal data may be shared with our Affiliates for purposes of rendering our Services to you. If the Affiliates wish to change the purpose of processing, they will ask for your consent, unless another lawful basis exists.
* • **Service Providers and Partners:** Some of our Services will be provided with the help of third parties. We may also share some personal data in particular with our partners to provide better Service to you and to improve your user experience.. We may also rely on service providers for identifying and serving targeted advertisements, providing mail services, providing tax and accounting services, contest fulfilment, web hosting or providing analytic services. Any such service providers will – by appropriate data processing agreements – be bound to only process personal data on our behalf and under our instructions, unless such service providers act as independent controllers.
* • **Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction:** Where a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation or similar action takes place, we may transfer or disclose your personal data to a limited, but necessary, extent to the applicable third party.
* • **Law enforcement, regulators and other parties for legal reasons:** We may also disclose your personal data with third parties as required by law or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a subpoena or other legal proceedings, legal actions or government agencies’ requests, (b) when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement, (c) to protect and exercise our legal claims, rights and property, (d) to protect your rights, property or personal safety or the one of others, (e) to investigate fraud and (f) to protect the security or integrity of our Services.
* • **The public, when posted in certain public spaces:** Some of our Services allow you to connect and interact with others. Your profile information or information that you post in a forum or on a blog, including personal data, will be accessible to other users or the general public by default when you create it. Such content will be accessible by the general public or the members of the Service depending on the Service used.
* • **Otherwise with consent:** We may disclose your personal data to certain other third parties with your consent.

### How Your Personal Data Is Transferred Globally

 

* 1\. Your personal data is stored in the UK. OPPO complies with all applicable legal requirements to safeguard personal data transferred outside of the UK. We may transfer your personal data to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as the UK and that does not provide for the same level of data protection as the United Kingdom.
* 2\. However, in such cases, we will take measures to ensure that the personal data we collect is processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws, and that your personal data is sufficiently safeguarded.
* 3\. In case your personal data is transferred to jurisdictions located outside the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards exist and are taken, such as:
* 1\. the recipient of the personal data is located within a country that benefits from an “adequacy” decision;
* 2\. the recipient has signed a contract based on industry standard data protection clauses, obliging them to protect your personal data;
* 3\. the recipient of the personal data is located within a country that is subject to the GDPR;
* 4\. or in the absence of the above appropriate safeguards, we will ask you for your explicit consent for the cross-border transfer of your personal data or take any other measures that are recognized as providing a sufficient level of protection for your personal data.
* 4\. For more information about the safeguards relating to personal data transfers outside the UK, please submit your request via our DSR platform ([https://www.oppo.com/uk/privacy-feedback](https://www.oppo.com/uk/privacy-feedback) ).

Should you decide to object to the processing of your personal data, we will stop processing personal data concerning you, unless we can demonstrate compelling reasons for continuing to process your personal data that override your interests, rights and freedoms or in the case that we establish, exercise, or defend our legal claims. You can object to direct marketing activities at any time for any reason whatsoever.
* • **The right to data portability:** You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and transmit such data to another provider or have such data transmitted to another provider under certain circumstances.
