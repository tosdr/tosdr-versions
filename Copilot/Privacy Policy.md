To collect the information in the “[Automatically Collected Information](#automatically-collected-information)” section above, we and our service providers may use web server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future.

These third parties may use cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and your activities across other websites and online services, which they may associate with persistent identifiers. Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address. We may use this information to measure the performance of our advertising as well, for instance, to evaluate which ads or content our users prefer, or which are most effective. In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.

Their activities and your choices regarding their use of your information to personalize ads to you are subject to and set out in their own policies. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device by non-affiliated, third-party providers.

We cannot guarantee that these instructions will not change, or that they will continue to be available; they are controlled by each third-party service provider, not us.
