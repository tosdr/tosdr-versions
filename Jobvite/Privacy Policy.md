To learn more about the Framework program, and to view an Employ entity certification, please visit [this site](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TOjFAAW&status=Active). If you are a European, United Kingdom or Swiss data subject with an unresolved complaint or dispute arising under the requirements of the Framework, Employ agree to refer your complaint under the Framework to an independent dispute resolution mechanism.

Employ has further committed to refer unresolved Framework-related complaints to JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive a timely acknowledgement of the Framework-related complaint from Employ, or if we have not satisfactorily resolved your complaint or addressed your concern, please contact JAMS to file your complaint, at no cost to you. To contact JAMS and/or learn more about JAMS dispute resolution services, including instructions for submitting a complaint, please visit: [https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield). Under certain limited situations, as a last resort, you may seek redress from the Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Framework Panel. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority situated in a Designated State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of alleged infringement.
