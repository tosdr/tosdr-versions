WiLine Service Agreement Terms and Conditions



This WiLine Service Agreement Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") is by and between WiLine Networks, Inc., with its principal

place of business at 104 Carnegie Center, Princeton, NJ 08540 ("WiLine") and entity (“Customer”) with its principal place identified

on the service agreement work order ("Service Agreement") for WiLine services (“Services”) described in the Service Agreement.

Any Services provided by WiLine to Customer shall be governed by the terms and conditions herein.



1. Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Agreement. The Services are provided to Customer by WiLine in accordance with

this Agreement and signed Service Agreement, which comprise the entire agreement between WiLine and Customer

superseding any prior agreements pertaining to this subject matter. Customer agrees that Customer is subject to any

posted policies or rules applicable to Services which may be posted at any time. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO BE

BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER IS NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.

PLEASE CONTACT WILINE CUSTOMER CARE AT CONTRACTS@WILINE.COM TO CLOSE CUSTOMER ACCOUNT AND

DISCONTINUE THE SERVICES. CUSTOMER'S CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES EVIDENCES CUSTOMER AGREEMENT TO

THE TERMS ANDCONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENT.



2. Customer Representations. Customer represents to WiLine that, at all times: (a) Customer is at least 18 years of age;

(b) Customer owns the premises at which the Services will be installed ("Site") or have the consent of the owner for any

changes needed to the Site for installation of the Service; (c) Customer has reviewed any restrictive covenants or

homeowner's restrictions and confirmed that an antenna and WiLine Equipment as defined below may be installed on the

Site; (d) Customer will notify WiLine of any change of occupancy, ownership, or tenancy of the Site; (e) Customer will use

the Service in accordance with this Agreement; and (f) Customer will provide and maintain routers, switches, firewalls,

computer(s), cabling and other customer-premises based equipment necessary to receive and operate the Service

(hereafter referred to as “Other Products”).



3. Services, Installation and Activation. The Service Installation Address (“Service Address”) will be recorded as

Customer’s Primary Place of Use. WiLine will provide the Services identified on the Service Agreement through either

WiLine’s own network, or in some cases another carrier’s network. If Services are provided through WiLine’s facilities,

WiLine will make said Services available at the Service Address within thirty (30) business days from the date this

Agreement is signed so long as delays described below have not occurred. If WiLine uses other carriers’ facilities and

services to provide the Services, WiLine will make said Services available at the Service Address within (90) business days.

It shall be the Customer’s responsibility to allow access to the facility for the third-party carrier, as well as coordinate with

the property owner at the Service Address to ensure Services can be terminated at a pre-established demarcation point.

The Term of this contract will commence on the 1st day of the following month that WiLine notifies Customer that a Service

is available. Notwithstanding any notice provisions in the Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of this Section,

notification of the Activation Date will be deemed delivered on the day such notice is provided by WiLine and billing will

commence on the earlier of the Activation Date, the date Customer first uses the Service, or 10-days after Customer is in

receipt of internet connectivity equipment. Customer acknowledges and agrees that if Customer causes an installation

delay of any of its services past sixty (60) days from signed agreement, Customer will pay all applicable monthly recurring

charges for all Customer’s services as if all services were installed and commenced on such Scheduled Service Date. If

Customer or its affiliate is the property owner of the Service Address listed above or controls use of and access to the

property, including any common spaces, rooftop, conduits, telecom closets or other space necessary to deliver services to

any tenant located at the Service Address, Customer grants a rent-free right of access to the property, including any

common spaces, rooftop, conduits, telecom closets, or any other space necessary to deliver services to any tenant located

at the Service Address. If WiLine is solely responsible for any delays in Service availability beyond that 30-business day

period, WiLine will credit any Install Fee or Setup Fee previously paid for that Service. To receive installation credit,

Customer must request the credit in writing or email to billing@wiline.com within 30 days of the date of the first invoice.

No credit will be issued, however, if delays were a result of: (a) WiLine’s inability to secure access to the

property/properties, including but not limited to rooftop(s), Main Point of Entry (MPOE), Customer suite or point of

demarcation; or (b) Customer’s faulty or incomplete facilities or equipment; or (c) Customer’s request for delay, failure to

promptly respond to WiLine’s request or timely supply any requested or necessary information; or (d) Customer’s

negligence or omissions; or (e) Customer’s failure to meet Agreement approval terms; or (f) any special installation

circumstances WiLine identified to Customer at the time of sale; or (g) events or circumstances beyond our control, such

as “Events of Force Majeure”; or (h) inability to acquire or maintain commercially reasonable transport and other facilities;

or (i) any delay pursuant to federal or state action; or (j) any delay in the transfer or porting of a phone number. Further,

no installation credit will be payable if Services require special set-up or installation at Customer’s Service Address,

whether or not identified at the time of sale. Should special set-up or installation be required, WiLine may terminate this

Agreement or cancel any Services without any obligation or liability to Customer. Installation commitments and credits do

not apply to any locations outside Service Address.



4. Service Level Guarantee and Commitment. Data services described herein consist of symmetric or asymmetric

Internet transit services and Ethernet private line connections, and are measured from Customer’s origination site

demarcation point to Customer’s termination site demarcation point. Internet transit services with different specified

upload and download speeds are asymmetric data services. Internet transit services with the same specified upload and

download speeds are symmetric data services. For WiLine’s Internet transit service, the Customer’s origination site

demarcation point is defined as the point at which WiLine interconnects with the customer’s MPOE in said Service Address

and the Customer’s termination site demarcation point is defined as the point at which WiLine interconnects with the

Internet. For WiLine’s Ethernet private line connections, the Customer’s origination site is defined as the point at which

WiLine interconnects with the Customer’s MPOE in said Service Address at one location and the Customer’s termination site

is defined as the point at which WiLine interconnects with the Customer’s MPOE at the second location. Voice service

described herein applies to the availability of ‘dial-tone’ and associated voice features at the demarcation point between the

WiLine network and the Customer’s MPOE in said Service Address. Service Level Guarantees are available only for WiNet

V1.4.3 Page 2 © WiLine Networks, Inc.



Data and Premium Internet Service symmetric data services, and Ethernet private line connection and voice services

provided to commercial Customers. Service Level Guarantees do not apply to the following: Asymmetric data

services, Standard Internet Service symmetric data services, in cases where an Ethernet private line

connection does not interconnect with WiLine’s network, in cases where a Voice service is operating over a

non-WiLine network, or in the case of any service provided to a residential Customer (“non-SLA services”).

Customer acknowledges and agrees that non-SLA Services are provided “as is” and credit allowances for

interruption of the Services shall not be provided.



4.1 Definition. “End-to-End Network Availability” or “Network Availability” or “Data Availability” is the number of

minutes in each calendar month during which a Service is available to exchange data between the Customer’s origination and

termination points and “Voice Availability” is defined as the availability of ‘dial-tone’ and shall be determined as follows:

[(Total Minutes in Calendar Month) – (Total Minutes of Non-Availability)] / (Total Minutes in Calendar Month).



“Total Minutes in Calendar Month” is determined by multiplying 24 hours times number of days in the month

times 60 minutes, and “Total Minutes of Non-Availability” means the total of all minutes of service Non-

Availability for a specific Service in a calendar month.



Customer’s Service shall be considered “Available” until the date/time of WiLine’s receipt from Customer of a Service Non-

Availability Notice and the issuance by WiLine to Customer of a Trouble Ticket. The measurement period for

determining Service Non-Availability shall commence upon WiLine’s receipt of a Service Non-Availability Notice and issuance

by WiLine of a Trouble Ticket and conclude upon the date/time of the Service Restoration Notice from WiLine to the

Customer.

“Mean Time to Repair” or “MTTR” is the monthly average time to repair all Trouble Tickets on a specific Service, with the

same severity level, during a Service Outage. The length of all Service Outages related to Customer is totaled at the end of

the service month and is divided by the total number of Trouble Tickets opened by the Customer for that service month:

(Cumulative Length of Service Outage(s) per Service) / (Total Number of Trouble Tickets per Calendar Month per Service)

“Service Outage” is an unscheduled period in which one or more of Customer’s Service(s) is interrupted and not usable

for sixty (60) or more seconds within a 15- minute period as measured by WiLine. A Service Outage will commence when

the Customer reports a Service Outage to WiLine via a Trouble Ticket and will end when the affected Service is restored and

WiLine issues a Service Restoration Notice. If the Customer fails to initiate a Trouble Ticket with WiLine, or does not release

the Service to WiLine for testing, WiLine will not be obligated to issue credits for the Service Outage.

“Trouble Ticket” is the official method used by the Customer to advise WiLine of a perceived Service outage.

“Service Restoration Notice” is the official method used by WiLine to advise Customer of the restoration of a Service

Outage.

“Latency” is the monthly average roundtrip packet travel time between two WiLine service-related mega-POP

locations(“POP-to-POP”).

“Jitter” is monthly average short-term variation of the digital signal from its ideal position in time. If Si is the timestamp

from packet i, and Ri is the time of arrival in timestamp units for packet i, then for two packets i and j, D may be expressed

as:

D(i,j) = (Rj - Ri) - (Sj - Si) = (Rj - Sj) - (Ri - Si)



“Packet Loss” is monthly average failure of one or more packets between Customer’s origination site demarcation point

and a test point on the WiLine network.

4.2 SERVICE LEVEL GUARANTEES.

With respect to each Service ordered by Customer and subject to the exclusions specified above, WiLine offers “Network

Availability”, “Voice Availability” (collective referred to as “Service Availability”), “Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)”,

“Latency”, “Jitter”, and “Packet Loss” Service Level Guarantees as described below.



Service Item Service Level Guarantee

Network Service 99.99% Availability

Voice Service 99.99% Availability

MTTR 4 Hours

Latency 10msec

Jitter 2msec

Packet Loss 0.001%



If the Service Availability, MTTR, Latency, Jitter, or Packet Loss for a particular service fall below the applicable parameters

in any given calendar month, Customer shall be eligible to receive a credit for such month in accordance to that described

below.



4.3 SERVICE CREDITS.

Customer will be entitled to the applicable credits (the “Service Credits” or “Credits”) should WiLine fail to meet the Service

Level Guarantee. These Credits are the customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for Service-related claims. Eligibility for any

credit is subject to the Customer’s account being held current and having no outstanding balance due. Service Credits will be

applied as a credit to Customer’s account, and Customer acknowledges that it normally takes approximately three to four

weeks after receipt of a valid Service Credit request for the request to be evaluated and processed. Pending evaluation of a

Service Credit request does not absolve Customer of Customer’s obligation to keep their account current and make timely

payments.

V1.4.3 Page 3 © WiLine Networks, Inc.



The non-compliance credit structure is based on monthly service fee calculations. For any service month in which WiLine

fails to meet a Service Level Guarantee, the Credit will be applied to the prorated monthly recurring service charges of the

affected Service as defined in the applicable Service Agreement.

For every hour of Network or Voice Service Non-Availability, Customer is eligible for two (2) hours of credit for any service

affected up to a maximum of one full month service credit in any given calendar month. Should Customer receive the

maximum service credit for three (3) consecutive months, Customer may terminate the Agreement without liability for Early

Termination Charges but liability for Services through the effective date of termination for that Service, subject to receipt of

fifteen (15) days prior written notice from Customer sent to contracts@wiline.com no later than thirty (30) days after the

end of the consecutive three (3) month period.



In addition to Service Non-Availability credits, if WiLine fails to meet the MTTR, Latency, Jitter, or Packet Loss guarantees,

customer shall be entitled to one (1) day’s credit prorated from the Customer’s Recurring Monthly Service Fees for each

service level item.

4.4 SERVICE CREDIT ELIGIBILITY.

To be eligible for a Service Credit, Customer must report a Service Outage to the appropriate WiLine Service Center and

submit a Service Non-Availability Notice and make a written request (the “Credit Request”) for a Service Credit from WiLine

within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Trouble Ticket. The Credit Request must contain the Trouble Ticket number, the

date the Trouble Ticket was opened and closed, and the credit identification number for each Service affected by a Service

Outage. If Customer fails to comply with the written notice requirement within the 30-day period described above,

Customer shall, with respect to such Service, have permanently waived its right to any Service Credit for the month in

which WiLine has failed to meet the Service Level Guarantee.

Customer must choose which Service Level Guarantee to be verified when seeking non-compliance. In the event WiLine is

non-compliant with Network Availability and Voice Availability, Customer will only receive non-compliance credits for one of

the two (2) missed Service Level Guarantees. In addition to Service Availability credits, in the event WiLine is non-compliant

with MTTR, Latency, Jitter or Packet Loss, Customer will only receive non-compliance credits for each Service Level

Guarantee.

Two (2) or more service interruptions to the same service of two (2) hours or more during any one 24-hour period shall be

considered as one interruption.

4.5 OTHER SERVICE LEVEL GUARANTEE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

The Service Level Guarantee shall not apply and a period of Service Non-Availability shall not be deemed to have occurred

(and a Service Credit not due Customer) in the event (a) the service is expressly excluded from being eligible for a Service

Level Guarantee or (b) if the service is unavailable due to any of the following

(1) scheduled Network maintenance; or

(2) the occurrence of a Force Majeure event; or

(3) the Interruptions on Services that are not “Accepted Services” (i.e., an Accepted Service is one that WiLine

and the Customer have tested and mutually agree is working as ordered); or

(4) The negligence, act, error, or omission of Customer or others authorized by Customer to use Customer’s

service; or

(5) Service Outages attributable to customer premise equipment (CPE), third party equipment or any Customer

application on a service; or

(6) Any act or omission on the part of Customer, its contractors, agents or vendors, including any refusal to

release a Service to WiLine for testing or maintenance; or

(7) WiLine or its agents not being afforded access to the premises where the access lines associated with

Customer’s service originate or terminate; or

(8) Customer or user has released service to WiLine for maintenance or rearrangement purpose, or for the

installation of Customer’s Service Agreement; or

(9) Customer elects not to release the service for testing and/or repair and continues to use it on an impaired

basis; or

(10) Customer use of services in an unauthorized or unlawful manner; or

(11) WiLine disconnects a Service for non-payment; or

(12) Customer submits an incorrect Service Agreement.

to terminate the Service should Customer not rectify the occurrence in a timely manner and to WiLine’s satisfaction. WiLine

reserves the right to immediately suspend Service of any Customer in violation of any part of the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of

2003\. The sending of any form of unsolicited bulk email (“UBE”) through the WiLine network is prohibited. Similarly, the

sending of UBE from another service provider advertising a website, email address or utilizing any resource hosted on

WiLine’s network, is prohibited. The Service may not be used to solicit customers from, or collect replies to messages sent

from other Internet service providers where those messages violate this Acceptable Use or that of the other provider.

Customers may not sell or distribute lists of “harvested” email addresses. Customers who provide or make use of a service

employing referral IDs will be considered responsible for UBE sent by members of the referral ID service that makes

reference to services provided by WiLine. Purchasing lists of email addresses from third parties for mailing through any

WiLine hosted network, collocation or referencing any WiLine account is prohibited.



Customers sending bulk email, using WiLine services, may only engage in such activity through the use of “closed-loop opt-

in” mailing lists, where this refers to lists obtained and assembled only be the sender and with the direct permission of the

listed recipients. Subscribing email addresses to any mailing list without the express and verifiable permission of the email

address owner is prohibited. Customers who send bulk email must have a method of confirmation or verification of

subscriptions ("Subscription Confirmation") and must be able to show evidence of such Subscription Confirmation to users

who complain about receiving unsolicited email. Customer shall keep all Subscription Confirmations for each mailing list

address for the duration of the existence and use of any mailing list and for a reasonable time after such use. Customer

must provide a mechanism by which email recipients can submit requests to unsubscribe from any mailing list. Customer

must honor all unsubscribe requests within 5 business days.

Customer may not send or attempt to send e-mail messages or transmit any electronic communications using a name or

address of someone other than Customer for purposes of deception. Any attempt to impersonate someone else by altering a

source IP address information or by using forged headers or other identifying information, including the domain name is

prohibited. Any attempt to fraudulently conceal, forge, or otherwise falsify Customer's identity in connection with use of the

Service is prohibited.

Customer shall not operate an account on behalf of, or in connection with, or reselling any service to, persons or firms listed

WiLine does not monitor on-line content; nevertheless, WiLine may suspend Service in order to remove content that WiLine

deems to be in violation of this AUP. The AUP applies to e-mail, USENET postings, chatting, and browsing. In the event

WiLine is notified of the existence of child pornography being transmitted over the WiLine network, WiLine may immediately

suspend Service.

In the event WiLine is notified of a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), WiLine shall forward such

complaint to Customer. Customer shall abide by the "takedown and notice" procedures set forth in the DMCA. Customer

expressly indemnifies WiLine from any costs, liabilities, or damages resulting from Customer's failure to abide by the DMCA

or this AUP. WiLine may, in its sole discretion, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users as a result of DMCA violation

notices.

Customer shall not obtain or attempt to obtain service by any means or device with intent to avoid payment. Customer shall

sequence attacks) to any other user whether on the WiLine network or on another provider's network.

Customer shall not use the Service to interfere with the use of the WiLine network by other customers or authorized users.

WiLine implements DNS name resolving servers in each market for the purpose of providing DNS name resolution services

("DNS Service") to our direct customer base. Customer is not permitted to resell this DNS Service or to package it into a

service or product that will in turn be resold to third parties. In addition, the DNS Service is to be used for the sole purpose

of DNS name resolution. Customer is not permitted to query the DNS Service for any purpose other than a specific

information request for use by WiLine direct customer and not to be-reused by a customer of WiLine’s direct customer,

except when used for troubleshooting and diagnostics.

Customer agrees not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems or networks connected to the

Services. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, in addition to other remedies in law or equity for Customer failure to

comply with these standards: (a) WiLine may ban Customer from future use of the Services; (b) WiLine may recover

damages from Customer; (c) WiLine may remove all data which, in WiLine's sole discretion and judgment, violate these

standards; and (d) Customer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless WiLine from all claims, damages, losses

(including all costs and attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to Customer representations, obligations or use of the

Services or WiLine equipment as defined below.

Each WiLine customer is responsible for the activities of its users and, by accepting service from WiLine, is agreeing to

ensure that its customers/representatives or end-users abide by this Agreement. Complaints about

customers/representatives or end-users of Customer will be forwarded to Customer's Postmaster for action. If violations

occur, WiLine reserves the right to terminate services with or take action to stop Customer from violating WiLine’s

Agreement as WiLine deems appropriate, without notice.

V1.4.3 Page 5 © WiLine Networks, Inc.



telemarketing, fax broadcasting or fax blasting, or for any other use that results in excessive usage inconsistent with normal

calling patterns. WiLine reserves the right to immediately disconnect, modify, or limit Customer’s Service if WiLine

determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that Customer’s use of the Service is, or at any time was, inconsistent with

normal usage patterns, including but not limited to over 60 calls per minute per line. Customer will defend, indemnify, and

hold WiLine, its affiliates, and their agents and suppliers harmless against any and all claims, losses, or liability arising

under this Section. The foregoing sentence will survive termination or expiration of the Agreement for any reason.

If Customer violates any provision of this AUP, WiLine reserves the right to immediately suspend the Service. In most cases,

WiLine will attempt to notify Customer of any AUP violations and may request that Customer immediately cease such

prohibited activity. However, in cases where the integrity of the WiLine network is threatened, where Customer violates the

AUP of a WiLine’s third party service provider, or in cases involving request from law enforcement or governmental agencies

or court orders, WiLine reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer’s Service without notification. In addition,

WiLine may take any other appropriate action, legal or otherwise, against Customer for violations of the AUP, including

termination of the WiLine Service Agreement and/or any service order form(s) signed by Customer.



For Residential Customers, WiLine’s Service’s for residential Customers are for the reasonable personal residential use of

Customer only. This means that Customer is not to resell or transfer the Service or Equipment to any other person for any

immediately if usage changes from personal residential to business use and to subscribe to a business plan. WiLine reserves

the right to immediately terminate or modify the Services of any Customer if WiLine determines, in its sole discretion, that

Customer is not using Services for Customer’s reasonable personal residential use.



6. Service Agreement. Services. WiLine Equipment. Other Products. Customer will approve a WiLine-issued

Service Agreement describing the Services for the Term at the corresponding price to be used at the Site. WiLine will

accept the Service Agreement and provide the Services subject to this Agreement and any applicable tariffs if Customer

qualifies and Customer complies with this Agreement. Customer is not allowed to assign this Agreement or any Service

Agreement, in whole or in part, without the express written consent of WiLine. Approval of any assignment is at the

sole discretion of WiLine. WiLine may modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services upon 60 days

prior written notice to Customer. Customer agrees that WiLine shall not be liable to Customer or any third party for any

modification or discontinuance of the Services. WiLine will provide the hardware and software listed on the Service

Agreement ("WiLine Equipment") which Customer agrees will be used only in conjunction with the Services. At all times,

title and risk of loss or damage remain with WiLine (excluding loss or damage caused by or attributable to Customer or

Customer employees, agents, or subcontractors). Customer will keep the WiLine Equipment free and clear of all liens,

attachments and other encumbrances. Customer will not assign, otherwise transfer or dispose, remove or relocate the

WiLine Equipment without WiLine's written consent. Unless the parties otherwise agree, Customer will make the WiLine

Equipment available for return within 5 days from the expiration or earlier termination of the Agreement at Customer's

expense.

WiLine will assign to Customer, on a temporary basis, an Internet Protocol Address ("IP Address") either from the address

space assigned to WiLine or a non-public NAT address. This IP Address belongs to WiLine and is not portable. WiLine

reserves the right to change the IP Address at any time, for any reason without notice or liability. In the event that such

change is required WiLine shall coordinate with the Customer so as to minimize impact to Customer’s use of Service.

Customer may be required, at Customer's expense, to provide and maintain Other Products.

To provide the Services, WiLine may ship Equipment to Customer. All Equipment shipments are F.O.B. WiLine’s facility.

WiLine's liability for delivery shall cease, and title (if applicable) and all risk of loss or damage shall pass to Customer upon

delivery to carrier.

Customer will be provided the manufacturer's warranty from the date of purchase of Equipment or Service. Customer shall

be required to obtain authorization from WiLine to return any Equipment. WiLine will provide replacement Equipment only if

the Equipment is deemed to be defective and covered under the warranty. WiLine will not cover replacement for lost, stolen

or modified equipment. Equipment returned by Customer that is not covered under warranty may be refused by WiLine, and

Customer will be responsible to pay return shipping charges.



7. Payment. Upon Service Activation (as defined in Section 3), billing will commence in advance on an annual billing

frequency. Service Fees, Install and Set-up Fees, and other charges begin for each Service as each Service is made

available to Customer, regardless of whether multiple Services may have been ordered on a single Service Agreement.

Where non-standard installation or Professional Services charges are incurred, WiLine, at its sole discretion, may invoice

for these charges prior to installation and activation of Service. For Voice services, activation may occur after dial tone.

Prices quoted on the Service Agreement may be subject to price adjustments. The Customer will receive at least

(30) days prior written notice of any such adjustments. Such notice will generally be provided in Customer’s monthly

statement. Each month, WiLine will send or make available online an electronic statement. Customer agrees to pay the total

amount of each invoice by the invoice due date shown on that invoice. Customer agrees to electronically pay invoices by

authorizing WiLine to debit Customer’s bank account using Automated Clearing House (“ACH”). Invoiced charges are due

and payable within twenty (20) days of the date of invoice. If Customer fails to pay any charges when due, WiLine may

V1.4.3 Page 6 © WiLine Networks, Inc.



collect a $50 late fee for commercial customers or $10 late fee for residential customers or the greater of 1-1/2% of the

amount then due or the maximum allowed by law plus all amounts then due, plus any of WiLine's costs or expenses

(including bank fees charged for insufficient funds or the like. Customer will advise WiLine of any billing discrepancies or

disputes within 20 days after receiving notice of the charge or the amount charged shall be deemed due and payable. WiLine

reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to apply an annual price adjustment to the current service fees, based on the

Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics. Currently, WiLine is

not required to and does not collect taxes for WiLine's broadband services. Voice services are provided to Customer by

VoiceCo. Inc. (“VoiceCo”). WiLine is the billing agent for VoiceCo. Any and all Federal, State and Local taxes, surcharges

and/or fees that may be due will be billed by WiLine on behalf of VoiceCo. WiLine and/or Federal, State and Local

governments may assess fees, surcharges and/or taxes on Customer's use of WiLine service. These charges may be a flat

fee or a percentage of Customer's WiLine charges and may change from time to time without notice. These charges are

based on the rates applicable to the address Customer provided to us. Customer is responsible for all applicable federal,

state, provincial, municipal, local, or other governmental sales, use, excise, value-added, personal property, public utility or

other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future, that arise from or as a result of Customer’s subscription

or use or payment for the Service. Such amounts are in addition to payment for the Service and will be billed as set forth in

this Agreement. If Customer is exempt from payment of such taxes, Customer must provide us with an original certificate

that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the

date WiLine receives such certificate.



8. Terms and Termination. The Term of this Service will be stated on the Service Agreement. At the end of the Initial

Term, this Agreement will be automatically renewed for successive Term periods (“Renewal Term”) until either party

terminates this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice which will commence at the start of the next billing cycle.

Such written termination notice must be sent to contracts@wiline.com and may be liable for Early Termination Charges as

detailed in Section 9.

Customer may terminate Services without liability for Early Termination Charges if Customer experiences Service Non-

Availability, subject to the terms of the Service Level Guarantee and Commitment for that particular Service. Customer may

also terminate this Agreement if WiLine fails to comply with any other WiLine obligation under this Agreement for 30

consecutive days after receiving written notice from Customer. In either case, Customer may terminate the affected Service

only if Customer’s account is current before termination (i.e., no balance due more than 30 days) and Customer and

Customer Equipment did not contribute to the Service Non-Availability or to WiLine’s failure to comply with this Agreement,

either directly or indirectly.

Customer may, however, terminate its Services at any time (with liability for Early Termination Charges) by written, 30-day

notification in advance of the end of the next billing cycle. To terminate its Services, Customer must send a notice of

cancelation to contracts@wiline.com including the Service Agreement numbers which Customer is terminating.

This Agreement will be immediately terminated, without notice, for a material breach, if Customer becomes insolvent, is

unable to pay its debts when due, files for bankruptcy, is the subject of involuntary bankruptcy, has a receiver appointed, or

has Customer's assets assigned. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason except for WiLine’s termination of the

contract without cause or Customer’s termination due to a material default by WiLine and WiLine failed to cure within such

notice period, WiLine may cancel any unfulfilled obligations and is entitled to collect all sums due resulting from such

termination, including Early Termination Charges.

WiLine may terminate this Agreement or suspend all of any Services if: (a) Customer fails to take any action that we have

requested in order for WiLine to install or activate the Service; (b) Customer fails to pay any amount owed to WiLine when

due, and fails to pay all past due amounts within ten (10) days after notice from WiLine; (c) Customer fails to comply with

the AUP described above; (d) Customer fails to perform or comply with any other obligation under this Agreement, and

does not perform and comply with that obligation within thirty (30) days after notice from WiLine; (e) WiLine determines at

any time (in WiLine’s sole discretion) that Customer’s payment record, ability to make timely payments or credit

worthiness has become unsatisfactory; (f) Customer is involved in or is the subject of any change-in-control, including

sales of Customer’s stock or assets, reorganization or merger. If WiLine elects to terminate this Agreement or any

Services, Customer must pay Early Termination Charges as described below. If WiLine elects to suspend any Services,

Customer must pay all resumption and other charges described in the following section.

If WiLine elects to suspend Services under any circumstances pursuant to this Agreement, then to resume those Services,

Customer must first pay all past due and other applicable charges, including any late payment fees and other fees

describe above, and a resumption fee of $100. Before WiLine resumes Services, WiLine may request satisfactory

assurances from Customer’s future ability to pay for Services in a timely manner, even if Customer has paid the required

resumption fee and other amounts. Those assurances may include a one-month advanced payment for future Services. If

Customer fails to provide satisfactory assurances (in WiLine’s sole discretion) or Customer fails to promptly make all

required payments to resume Services, then Customer will be considered to have terminated this Agreement. At such

time, Customer must pay Early Termination Charges, in addition to all other amounts owed under this Agreement.

At WiLine’s sole discretion, should this Agreement be terminated, Customer will return the IP Address and all of the

WiLine Equipment in good working order, wear and tear excepted within 30 days of termination for any reason with an

RMA issued by WiLine. WiLine may remove WiLine Equipment as Customer requests in accordance with its then standard

prices and terms and conditions. If Customer fails to return WiLine Equipment, Customer agrees to provide access to the

Site for WiLine to remove WiLine Equipment at Customer's expense at WiLine's request, or to pay for the WiLine

Equipment at the manufacturer's MSRP. Customer will also pay WiLine for any WiLine Equipment damaged or lost, normal

wear and tear excepted. WiLine is not responsible for holes, or WiLine Equipment customer elects to ask WiLine to leave

on the Site after de-installation.



9. Early Termination Charges. Except for proper termination of this Contract under Section 8 above, in every other instance

in which this Agreement terminates before the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, Customer is responsible to pay an

early termination charge (“Early Termination Charge”). Early Termination Charges will be calculated as follows:

or activates the Services, Customer shall be liable for $1,000;

If termination occurs during the Initial Term or Renewal Term of this Agreement: all outstanding nonrecurring fees plus

all Monthly Fees for each month remaining for the balance of the Initial or Renewal Term.



10. Ported Telephone Numbers on Service Disconnection. Customer may request, or “port”, Customer’s current telephone

number(s) to another service provider. WiLine will use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate a port. Customer will be

responsible for all charges and fees required by said service provider as well as WiLine’s charges as detailed in the then

current price list associated with this port and must have paid any current and outstanding invoices.



11. Privacy. WiLine utilizes the public Internet and third-party networks to provide fax, voice, data, and video communication

services. Accordingly, WiLine cannot guarantee the security of fax, voice and video communications of Customer. WiLine is

committed to respecting Customer’s privacy. Once Customer chooses to provide personally identifiable information, it will

only be used in the context of the Customer’s relationship with WiLine. WiLine will not sell, rent, or lease Customer’s

personally identifiable information to others. Unless required by law or subpoena or if Customer’s prior permission is

obtained, WiLine will only share the personal data Customer provides with other WiLine entities and/or business partners

that are acting on WiLine's behalf to complete the activities described herein. Such WiLine entities and/or national or

international business partners are governed by WiLine's privacy policies with respect to the use of this data. WiLine may be

information. However, WiLine reserves the right to use personally identifiable information to investigate and help prevent

potentially unlawful activity that threatens either WiLine or any company affiliated with WiLine. Moreover, upon the

appropriate request of a government agency, law enforcement agency, court or as otherwise required by law, WiLine may

disclose personally identifiable information.



12. Notices. WiLine communicates with Customers primarily via Customers’ monthly statement. Notices to Customer shall

be sent to the email address specified by Customer at the time of registration for the Services or as subsequently

specified by Customer ("Billing Email Address"). Customer is responsible for notifying WiLine of any Billing Email Address

changes. Customer agrees that sending a message or notification via the Customer’s monthly statement addressed to the

Billing Email Address is the agreed upon means of providing notification. These Notices communicate important

information about the Services, billing, changes to the Services and other information. The information is time-sensitive

in nature. It is required that Customer read any Notices sent to the Billing Email Address in a timely manner in order to

avoid any potential interruption in the Services provided hereunder.



13. Installation and Ongoing Access. Other Products. Standard installation consists of installing the WiLine Equipment at

the MPOE in said Service Address (“Demarcation Point”). Customer is solely responsible for bringing WiLine’s services from

the MPOE to customer’s suite. Additional work that may be required to complete installation, including the wiring installation

from the MPOE in said Service Address to the customer’s suite where Other Products exists and additional equipment not

specified in the Service Agreement, and other services may be performed by WiLine, should customer request WiLine to

perform these services (“Professional Services”) on a time and materials basis. WiLine will perform a Site survey and

provide Customer with the installation and maintenance specifications required for installation of the Service. Customer is

solely responsible for providing, installing, operating and maintaining Other Products. After Customer prepares the Site

including installing Other Products, at Customer's expense, as required by the Site survey, WiLine will install the Service.

Customer must provide WiLine and its authorized installers such ongoing access to the Site as required to complete

installation. Customer also grants WiLine, and its authorized representatives, the right to enter Customer's Site during

normal business hours, Monday through Saturday, subject to Customer’s security policies, to install, repair, replace or

remove WiLine Equipment. WiLine is not responsible for any Site alterations or holes because of installation or removal of

WiLine Equipment.

Customer ensures that Other Products are compatible with the Service. Customer will change obsolete Other Products and

ensure such Other Products do not interfere with the Services. If Other Products impair Customer's use of Services,

Customer will continue to pay WiLine for the Services. If WiLine notifies Customer that the Other Products impair or are

likely to impair Service, Customer agrees to remove or repair the impediment. WiLine, at its election and without liability,

may suspend Services until the impairment is corrected. At Customer's request, WiLine may assist with identifying and

repairing problems caused by Other Products at WiLine's then current prices and standard terms and conditions.

must request that move in writing to WiLine at least 45 days in advance. The new location must be in the United States of

America and must be a commercial property if the customers current “Service Address” is a commercial space. If the new

location is serviceable by WiLine, the Customer and WiLine must enter into a new Agreement with a term of no less than

the Initial Term (the “Replacement Agreement”). The Replacement Agreement may include additional or different

installation, recurring and other charges and fees, however in any event Customer will be required to pay an installation

charge without discount. After the Service is provided to the new location, the Agreement for the original Service Address

will be terminated with no liability for Early Termination Charges provided the monthly recurring cost of the services in the

Replacement Agreement is not less than the monthly recurring cost of the services being replaced, otherwise Customer will

liable for a prorated early termination fee. If Customer’s new location is not within WiLine’s service area or a new

agreement for the new location is not entered into by the parties, then Customer will be deemed to have terminated this

Agreement and Early Termination Charges will apply.

invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in

the provision and rule that the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. Customer agrees that
