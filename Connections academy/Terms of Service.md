Additional Terms Applicable to Users at Connections Academy Schools
===================================================================

WebMail, Message Boards, School Equipment and Other Communication Services
==========================================================================

These terms apply to the use of any school and school-provided equipment.

When using external communication services and/or tools, students must comply with the expectations provided by their teacher, school policies and the Honor Code.

Pearson offers an internal email system, WebMail, through Pearson Online Classroom, as a service to certain Users in connection with those education programs that provide for webmail service. Webmail allows those Users to interact with other Webmail Users. Pearson cannot guarantee the security of any information that such Users disclose in WebMail messages, and the Users do so at their own risk. Sent WebMail messages are accessible only to the author and recipients, as well as other authorized personnel for the purpose of maintaining system integrity and to ensure that Users are acting responsibly and legally as required by these Terms. WebMail messages are also not guaranteed to be private and may be monitored. Messages relating to or in support of illegal or obscene activities or that otherwise violate these Terms may be reported to the appropriate authorities and may result in the loss of privileges, removal from the User's respective education programs, and/or legal action.

Pearson also operates academic Message Boards located within Pearson Online Classroom to facilitate the exchange of ideas, information, and opinions between Users whose respective education program provides access to Message Boards. These Users may only use the Message Boards for structured clubs, activities, and other educational uses as specified by each school department and as described on each Message Board. The Message Boards contain contributions that represent only the opinions of their respective authors and do not express the opinions of Pearson. Use of the Message Boards is subject to the rules governing their use as provided when accessing them (see also the Links section below).

In addition to the WebMail system and the Message Boards, Pearson may from time to time offer chat areas and/or other message or communication functionality designed to enable Users to communicate with others (each a "Communication Service" and collectively "Communication Services"). The User agrees to use Communication Services only in compliance with these Terms and as described on each Communication Service to post, send, and receive messages and materials that are proper and, when applicable, related to the particular Communication Service.

Any information that you submit to be posted to a Message Board or other Communication Service will be disclosed and available to all Users of that Communication Service and is, therefore, no longer private. We cannot guarantee the security of such information that you disclose or communicate online in public areas, and you do so at your own risk. Pearson does not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in any Communication Service; therefore, Pearson specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from a User's participation in any Communication Services. All participants acknowledge that any reliance upon such content shall be at the sole risk of the person so relying.

Although Pearson has no obligation to do so, Pearson reserves the right (i) to monitor anything posted to a Message Board or other Communication Services or anything sent via WebMail, and (ii) to remove anything which Pearson considers offensive or otherwise in breach of these Terms or for any other reason as Pearson deems necessary in its sole and absolute discretion. Pearson also reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as Pearson deems necessary to satisfy any disciplinary investigation, applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, at Pearson’s sole discretion.

Use of School Work, Interviews, Photographs, and Videos
=======================================================

Users may have the opportunity to provide material for inclusion in Pearson Online Classroom. This material may include the submission of work samples; participation in clubs; postings on the Message Boards; text or other submissions for newsletters, newspapers, and yearbooks; writing WebMail messages; etc. Users represent that they own and/or control all of the rights to User's own material and that the public use of such material will not violate or infringe on the rights of Pearson or any third party.

Users may also have the opportunity to participate in a LiveLesson®. Pearson cannot guarantee the security of any information disclosed by voice or text in a LiveLesson session. Any information that a User submits or is captured in a LiveLesson session may be disclosed and available to all Users and is, therefore, no longer private. Parents or legal guardians are responsible for any information disclosed by their minor children.

LiveLesson sessions may be recorded and used for instructional and demonstrative purposes. The User, for themself or the User’s minor child, hereby agrees to the recording of LiveLesson sessions in which the User participates. To the extent a User does not wish to participate in a recorded LiveLesson, recorded sessions are available to the User to view on demand.
