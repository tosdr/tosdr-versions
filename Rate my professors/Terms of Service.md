**19\. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: BINDING ARBITRATION; NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS**

**19.1 Binding Arbitration and Exclusions from Arbitration.**

**EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN** **SECTION 19.5****), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND Rate My Professors WILL BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.** You and Rate My Professors agree to submit to individual arbitration the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or Rate My Professors, **except that you and Rate My Professors agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this** **Section 19.1****:** (A) any Claim filed by you or Rate My Professors with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, Rate My Professors, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to content that you upload to or share on the Site and/or (B) you or Rate My Professors may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in Section 20 in connection with any Claim whereby you or Rate My Professors, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Section 19.1(A)), where such Claim under this Section 19.1(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Section 19.2 below; provided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 19. You and Rate My Professors agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of Section 19 will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-9 ("FAA"). Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited. An arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneys' fees). "Claim(s)" means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or Rate My Professors relating to the Site and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, this Site's Privacy Policy and all Additional Terms, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies which we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.

**Except with respect to Claims described in** **Section 19.1(B)** **above, before either you or Rate My Professors pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or Rate My Professors must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim.** You may send a written notice of your Claim to Rate My Professors at 1 State St, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10004, Attention: Rate My Professors, LLC General Counsel. Rate My Professors may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, Rate My Professors account or any physical or other address Rate My Professors has for you. The notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim. Except with respect to Claims described in Section 19.1(B) above, you and Rate My Professors agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and Rate My Professors do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in Section 19 or court as permitted by Section 19.1.

**19.3 Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.**

In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any Claim informally, then such Claim shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration.  The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to either the JAMS Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as modified herein, including the Optional Appeal Procedure, at the office of JAMS at the location set forth in Section 20, or its successor (“JAMS”) in effect at the time the request for arbitration is made (the “Arbitration Rules”).  If you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send a copy of any initiating forms to Rate My Professors, which should be sent to Rate My Professors at the following address: 1 State St., New York, NY 10004  Attention: Rate My Professors Inc. General Counsel. The parties agree that the costs of the arbitration (excluding attorney’s fees) will be shared pro rata to the extent permitted by law, except you agree to reimburse Rate My Professors for all fees associated with the arbitration (including attorneys fees) paid by Rate My Professors in the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious.  The arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules.  The arbitrator shall follow New York substantive law and the Federal Rules of Evidence in adjudicating the Dispute.  In all cases, you and Rate My Professors shall exchange documents and other information that you or Rate My Professors intend to use in the arbitration.  The arbitrator will provide a detailed written statement of decision, which will be part of the arbitration award and admissible in any judicial proceeding to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the neutral arbitrator and the members of any appeal panel shall be former or retired judges or justices of any New York state or federal court with experience in matters involving the industry.  If either party refuses to perform any or all of its obligations under the final arbitration award (following appeal, if applicable) within thirty (30) days of such award being rendered, then the other party may enforce the final award in any court of competent jurisdiction in New York County.  The party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in enforcing the award, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.  The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

**19.4 Class Action Waiver.**

**UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN** **SECTION 19.5****), YOU AND Rate My Professors AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.** You and Rate My Professors expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and Rate My Professors, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding. The arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and Rate My Professors, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable. Neither you nor Rate My Professors consent to class arbitration.
