Further, Virtual Items may be used in the course of game play.<br>            <br>        5. Except as expressly stated in these Terms, you have no property, proprietary or ownership interest in, or other right or license to, the Platform or any Virtual Item, all of which remain the exclusive property of Kongregate or its licensors.<br>            <br>        6. The Virtual Items are protected in the U.S. and internationally under trademark, copyright and/or other rights protected by intellectual property laws. Your use of any Virtual Item outside the scope of the Services constitutes infringement of such intellectual property rights.<br>            <br>        7. Software that may be available in connection with our Services (the “**Software**”) is further subject to United States export controls. No Software may be downloaded from the Platform or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Downloading or using the Software is at your sole risk.<br>            <br>    2. Tokens. Tokens are Digital Assets that may only be used on the blockchain portion of our Services. Through our Services, you may make transactions for fungible tokens as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).<br>        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>        1. Your purchase of an NFT through the Kongregate’s Services results in a license grant to you for the right to control such NFT but does not include the grant of any intellectual property in such NFT. All intellectual property rights of any NFT received through the Services remain the sole property of the original creator of such NFT, unless otherwise specified.<br>            <br>        2. Transactions involving the exchange of NFTs may only occur through an Approved Marketplace, as described below. If you choose to transfer or sell your Digital Assets outside of an Approved Marketplace, you do so at your own risk.<br>            <br>        3. Additional Transaction Fees. Transactions on an Approved Marketplace may be subject to other costs and fees. Purchasers of Tokens may be subject to gas fees in addition to the cost of the Token. Sellers may be subject to network protocol fees, platform fees and/or royalties to the creator of an NFT.<br>            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>            <br>        4. An “**Approved Marketplace**” is any NFT marketplace that permits the transfer of NFTs in a manner that fully enables the smart contract (“**Smart Contract**”) contained within such NFTs (such transfer on an Approved Marketplace, a “**Secondary Sale**”).<br>            <br>        5. Any Secondary Sale or other transfer will be subject to these Terms and any applicable additional terms, including without limitation the Smart Contract, terms Kongregate may provide in connection with the transfer of NFTs, and the Approved Marketplace’s terms. For clarity, the recipient of any NFT in a Secondary Sale or other transfer will be subject to these Terms.<br>            <br>        6. If at any time you dispose of or transfer an NFT for any reason, will have no further rights in or to the NFT or any intellectual property rights associated with such NFTs).<br>            <br>    3. Blockchain Platform. Kongregate and the Services rely upon a platform to enable all blockchain and Token functionality. You agree that, if the Company’s relationship with or access to the platform terminates for any reason, the platform provider has no responsibility for any losses or liabilities that may occur, directly or indirectly, as a result of such termination (including impacts on the valuation or liquidity of your NFTs).<br>        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>        While Kongregate offers a marketplace for NFTs, it does not buy, sell or take custody or possession of any NFTs on a users’ transactions, nor does Kongregate act as an agent or custodian on behalf of any user of the Services. Instead, each NFT that is listed for sale will be deposited into a blockchain-based smart contract to ensure that the purported seller owns such NFT. Each such NFT is released automatically upon consummation of its sale through the relevant blockchain network. If you elect to mint, buy, or sell any NFTs, any transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the relevant blockchain network governing such NFT. You will be required to make or receive payments exclusively through the cryptocurrency wallet you have connected to Kongregate’s blockchain platform. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. Accordingly, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Service. There may be royalties associated with the secondary sale of any NFT. You acknowledge and agree that the payment of any such royalty shall, in certain circumstances, be programmed to be self-executing via a blockchain network’s nonfungible token standard and Kongregate does not have any control or ability to direct such funds or the obligation to collect such fees.<br>        <br>    4. Valuation of NFTs and Assumption of Risk. The prices and value of NFTs are volatile and subjective. NFTs and similar assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. The Kongregate and the platform provider do not and cannot guarantee that any NFTs purchased or acquired by you will retain their original value or have any particular value. You agree to assume all risk associated with the use and value of the NFTs. You also acknowledge and agree that we may engage in actions that may impact the perceived value or acquired price of NFTs at any time, except as prohibited by applicable law.<br>        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>          <br>        <br>    5. Taxes. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to the Digital Assets and any transactions you conduct through the Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.<br>        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>          <br>        <br>10. THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES.<br>    -------------------------------<br>    <br>    Our Services may feature advertisements from third party companies and/or link to third party sites or content. Such third party sites are not maintained by or related to Kongregate and such a link does not mean we endorse or approve of such linked site or information on that site. Please review our Privacy Policy which explains what information we share with advertisers.<br>    <br>    Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility. Kongregate is not liable for any claim relating to any content, goods or services of third parties.<br>    <br>      <br>    <br>11. INDEMNIFICATION.<br>    ----------------<br>    <br>    You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Kongregate, its parents, subsidiaries, officers, employees, and contractors harmless from and against any and all third party claims, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or in connection with (A) your use of our Services; (B) your UGC;<br>    <br>    (C) your conduct or interactions with other users of our Services; or (D) your breach or violation of these Terms, including the Code of Conduct or any applicable laws or regulations or any breach or violation thereof by your dependents or someone using your username or Account.<br>    <br>    We will promptly notify you of any such claim and will at your request provide you (at your expense) with reasonable assistance in defending the claim. You will allow us to participate in the defense and will not settle any such claim without our prior written consent. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that event, you will have no further obligation to defend us in that matter.<br>    <br>      <br>    <br>12.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY; WAIVER<br>    --------------------------------<br>    <br>    YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF KONGREGATE’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR BREACH<br>    <br>    OF KONGREGATE’S WARRANTY AND EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS AND LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RECOMPENSE.<br>    <br>    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES COLLECTIVELY, SHALL NOT EXCEED USD$100.00.<br>    <br>      <br>    <br>    IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES ANY AMOUNT IN THE ONE YEAR IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY SUCH CLAIM, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES AND TO CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.<br>    <br>      <br>    <br>    BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EACH OF KONGREGATE, ITS LICENSORS, AND ITS AFFILIATES’ LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

Each party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection to such choice of exclusive governing law and jurisdiction and any claim that any such action or proceedings brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Unless otherwise mutually agreed between the parties in writing, the arbitration shall be conducted with a panel of three arbitrators, selected in accordance with the Rules.

DEFINITIONS. The following definitions apply to these Services:<br>    ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>    <br>    1. “Binding Type” is a category on an item that denotes if the item will be specifically associated to a Hero or to the Player. Each and every item (with the exception of a Bitverse Hero) has a designated Binding Type of either being “Hero Bound” or “Player Bound.”<br>        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    2. “Bitverse Hero” is a Hero within the Game that is an NFT. As an NFT, it may be transferable, so a Bitverse Hero has no Binding Type. A Bitverse Hero may have Hero Bound items associated with it, in which case, such items remain linked to the Bitverse Hero. If a Player transfers a Bitverse Hero, all of the Hero Bound items associated with that Bitverse Hero will transfer, and the transferor will no longer have any rights to such Bitverse Hero or the associated Hero Bound items.<br>        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    3. “Equipped” references items associated to a Hero.<br>        -------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    4. “Hero Bound” means an item, once acquired, is associated with a specific Hero. As such, the item stays with that Hero, and is only accessible while that Hero is the current Hero. All acquired Hero Bound items associated with a specific Hero stays with such Hero even if the Player transfers ownership of such Hero. Hero Bound items may not be transferred to another Hero. Examples of Hero Bound assets may include weapons, mounts or pets.<br>        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    5. “Player Bound” means an item, once acquired, is associated with the Player’s account. As such, the item stays with the Player and is accessible at any time by any Hero in the Player’s account, as long as that Hero is the current Hero. All acquired Player Bound non-NFT items associated with a Player’s account stay with that Player and may not be transferred to another player’s account. The only type of Player Bound items that are transferable are NFT Items. Examples of Player Bound assets may include gold, gems, or Scroll of Item Find or NFT items.<br>        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    6. “Staked” means the player’s NFT has been placed in “escrow” within a central Kongregate-controlled wallet. While staked, the NFT will remain associated with the player’s wallet that they transferred it from, but will not be in the player’s associated wallet. While staked, the player will be unable to list, trade, or otherwise dispose of their NFT. To bring the NFT back to the player’s wallet, the player will need to “unstake” the NFT from the Bitverse. Unstaking can be done on thebitverse.io website. The only way to use a Bitverse NFT in any of the Bitverse games is to stake the NFT.<br>        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    7. “Staking” means the process by which the player’s NFT is transferred from the player’s wallet and placed in “escrow” within a central Kongregate-controlled wallet. Staking allows the player to use the NFT within the Bitverse games.<br>        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    8. “Unstaking” means the process by which the player’s NFT is transferred from “escrow” within a central Kongregate-controlled wallet back to the player’s wallet that was used during the staking process. The act of unstaking removes the player’s NFT from use within the Bitverse games.<br>        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>    9. “Unstaked” means that the player has requested that an NFT that they own that has been staked (held in escrow) with thebitverse.io leaves the Bitverse and is returned to their wallet. At the time of unstaking, the following will occur:<br>        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>        <br>        1. Any and all Player Bound items associated with that Bitverse Hero lose their association to the Bitverse Hero, are removed from the Character, and are returned to their storage locations on the Player's account;<br>        2. The Bitverse Hero NFT will enter into a “review” period that shall last no longer than five (5) business days, where a Kongregate representative will conduct a manual review of the NFT;<br>        3. If Kongregate uncovers a discrepancy, whereby Kongregate believes, in its sole reasonable discretion, that the player has gained an unfair advantage (or cheated), Kongregate reserves the right to remove the in-game progression from the Bitverse Hero NFT. Prior to the removal:<br>            1. Kongregate shall notify player (provided that player has provided an email address or other contact information) of its finding during the review period;<br>            2. The player will have the opportunity to appeal the finding within five (5) business days of receipt of the notice of such findings;<br>            3. If the player does not respond within such time period or does not provide sufficient evidence to explain the discrepancy within such time period, then Kongregate shall have the right to automatically will remove the in-game progression with no further action; and<br>            4. All such decisions of Kongregate shall be final and binding in all respects.<br>        4. Upon completion of the manual review, the Bitverse Hero will be transferred from the Kongregate-controlled wallet to the player’s wallet.<br><br>  <br><br>Last updated: May 21, 2024<br><br> <br><br>Email Address<br><br> Send me updates<br><br>Password _(min. 10 characters)_<br><br>Date of Birth<br><br>January Febuary March April May June July August September October November December 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021<br><br>Username _(4-16 characters)_<br><br> I have read and agree to the [Privacy Policy](https://www.kongregate.com/privacy), [User Agreement](https://www.kongregate.com/user-agreement) and [Cookie Policy](https://www.kongregate.com/cookie-policy)<br><br>Parent or guardian email address _Your parent or guardian must review and agree on your behalf to register_<br><br>​ |     |
