### ABOUT OUR ADS

#### We use common tracking technologies.

We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites. We also work with third parties that collect personal information this way. These third parties may have tools they place on our sites. Our vendors may also use these tools. In this policy "we" and "us" refers to both PepsiCo and our vendors.

#### We use tracking technologies for a variety of reasons.

We use several common tracking tools. These may include browser cookies. We may also use web beacons, flash cookies, and similar technologies. Third parties also use these tools on our sites and elsewhere on our behalf. Cookies are small files that download when you access certain websites.

#### We engage in interest-based advertising.

We or our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include on mobile applications ("apps").

Interest-based advertising (sometimes called "online behavioral advertising") includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based upon your browsing habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads on our behalf. They might be about our products and brands or about other companies' products and brands.

#### How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based advertising?

To help us decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We or our partners might look at your location. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.

We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That information might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.

#### You can control certain tracking tools.

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go [here](https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html). Why? because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

**Our Do Not Track Policy:** Some browsers have "do not track" features that allow you to instruct a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
