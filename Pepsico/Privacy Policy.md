=======

Welcome to the PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") web site. Below you will find our Privacy Notice regarding any personal information that you may supply to us through this web site.

### PEPSICO PRIVACY NOTICE

##### June 30, 2024

It is our aim through this **PEPSICO UNITED STATES PRIVACY NOTICE (“Notice”)** to explain what information we collect about you and why we collect that information. We also want to make sure you understand how we use and share your information and the choices available to you. Our goal is to earn and keep your trust as you visit websites and applications about our products and brands.

This Notice describes how we treat personal information on websites (“sites”), mobile or social media applications (“apps”), and any other services where we include an authorized link or reference to this Notice (together, the “Services”). This Notice does not describe our practices on sites or apps where it is not referenced.

Your use of our apps and sites indicates you agree to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as set forth in this Notice.

##### What information do we collect?

**We collect identifiers and contact information.** For example, we may collect your name and street address if you register on our site or apps. We may also collect your phone number or email address. We also collect online identifiers. For example, if you engage with us through a social media site, we may collect your social media user identifier.

**We collect payment information.** If you make purchases with us, we (or our business partners who process payment cards for us) may collect your billing information. This includes your payment card number.

**We collect information you submit or otherwise provide or authorize us to collect.** We collect the information you post in a public space on our site. This includes comments and videos or photos. We also collect any other information you may provide to us or authorize us to collect. This may include information about your physical activities or your nutrition preferences.

**We collect demographic information and information about your interests.** We may collect information such as your gender and age, household or lifestyle information, and your zip code.

**We collect internet and electronic network activity information, such as device and usage information.** We may collect information about the browser you are using, and we may look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We may also collect information about your operating system, Internet Service Provider (ISP) information and IP addresses and other device identifiers, such as mobile device identifiers. In addition, we may collect information about your use of our Services, including through use of tracking technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies. For additional information, please visit our [About Our Ads](https://www.pepsico.com/legal/about-our-ads) policy.

**We collect geolocation information.** Using technologies such as GPS or Wi-Fi, we may collect information about your location. For example, if you use our mobile apps, we may access your device’s location information to provide you location-enabled features.

**We collect job application information, such as professional or employment-related information and education information.** We collect information if you apply for a job with us. This information may include your education and work history, your skills, and qualifications for the position. We may ask about how you learned about the position. If applicable, we may ask about your driving record and your ability to perform the position. We may also collect the last four digits of your social security number and your nationality.

**We collect information about third parties.** From time to time, we may allow you to send an email or message to a friend through one of our sites or apps. If you choose to do this, we will need that person’s name and email address.

##### How do we collect information?

We collect information directly from you. We collect information from you when you:

* Sign up for our email newsletters and other notifications.
* Participate in promotions such as sweepstakes or contests.
* Fill out a survey.

We collect information about usage and browser information over time. We may have third parties collect personal information this way. We also collect information about you from our mobile apps.

**Third parties may also share information about you with us.** For example, our business partners may give us information about you. We may receive information from companies who compile information about shoppers and their preferences. Social media platforms may also give us information about you, and we may get information about your interactions with our ads on third-party sites.

##### We may combine information from different sources

**We may combine information.** For example, we may combine information we have collected offline with information we collect online. We combine information we have collected across third-party sites, including social media sites. We combine information across devices such as computers and mobile devices. We may also combine information from third parties with information we already have.  

##### How we may use the information we collect

**We may use information to help us effectively provide you products and services.** We use your information to respond to your questions or enable you to participate in our programs. This may include sweepstakes or contests. Another example is that we may use your information to process your registration with sites and apps. We may use your friends’ email addresses to send them information you requested we send them. We also use your information to process orders for you. We may also contact you if you have won a prize or promotion.

**We may use information to improve our products and services.** One of our goals is that you have a positive experience with our sites, apps, and products. Therefore, we may use your information to improve your experience with our sites, apps, and products. We might use your information to personalize your experience with us. We may use information you provide or that third-party partners give us to personalize your experience.

**We may use information for security and safety purposes.** We may use your information to help protect you, our sites and apps, our company, our customers, and our consumers.

**We may use information for marketing purposes.** For example, we might send you information about products, offers, features, or updates. We might also use your information to serve you ads about products and offers. Those ads may appear on third-party platforms which may include social media. These might be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting. We may provide you with information through email or push notification.

**We may use information to get feedback from you about how we’re doing and for other transactional purposes.** We may contact you about this Notice or the Terms of Use posted to the sites or apps you are using. We may also communicate with you about a job application or your questions about our products or promotions.

**We may use information as the law allows us or as we may notify you.**

##### How we may share information we have collected

**We may share information within the PepsiCo family of companies and brands.** This includes current and future PepsiCo subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint venture partners. This also includes current brands such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Gatorade, and Quaker; and all future brands. For a list of PepsiCo brands, visit [http://www.pepsico.com/brands/product-information](http://www.pepsico.com/brands/product-information). We may also share information with third parties with which we have an ownership interest or commercial relationship, such as companies whose products we distribute.

**We may share information with third-party vendors.** We may share information with companies who serve as our vendors or third parties who perform services on our behalf. They may help us deliver products or services to you. For example, we may share information with companies who operate our sites and apps or who run our promotions.

**We may share information with select business partners.** For example, we may share information with joint promotion partners. If you register for a joint promotion, your information may be collected by both us and the third party. This might include retailers. Your information will be used by us as described in this Notice or by promotion partners as described in their policies.  

**We work with analytics and advertising partners.** Our online Services may use analytics, advertising and other third-party content or functionality through which our partners may collect internet and electronic network activity information, such as device and usage information. For additional information, please visit our [About Our Ads](https://www.pepsico.com/legal/about-our-ads) policy.

**We will share information if we think we must in order to comply with the law or to protect our company.** For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share information if a government agency or investigatory body requests it. This includes United States and non-United States law enforcement or regulatory authorities. We may also share information if we are investigating potential fraud.

**We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.** For example, if part of our business is sold we may include your information as part of that transaction.

**If there are additional reasons we may share information, we will describe those to you.**

##### You have certain choices about how we use your information

**You can opt out of email marketing.** To stop receiving promotional emails from us, follow the instructions in any promotional email message you get from us. If you opt out of getting marketing email messages, you may continue to receive non-marketing email messages from us where permitted by law.  

**You can control cookies and tracking tools.** To learn how to manage how we and our vendors use cookies and other tracking tools, and to read our [About Our Ads](https://www.pepsico.com/legal/about-our-ads) policy.

_Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms._ Some web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites. Because the standards for these signals are still under development, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.

**You can control tools on your mobile devices.** For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. To modify the push notifications you get from our app, you can alter your preferences in your profile.

**You may have other choices under applicable state laws.** Depending on where you live, you may have certain additional rights, as described below. We only honor these rights where required by law.

* You may have a right to request to confirm whether or not we process your personal information as well as to access and receive a copy of the specific personal information we have collected about you in a portable format. 
* You may have a right to request deletion of your personal information. 
* You may have a right to request correction of any inaccurate personal information we hold about you.
* You may have the right to opt out of the sale, sharing or targeted advertising of personal information to third parties.
* In some circumstances, you may have the right to opt out of automated decision making and profiling, such as where it produces legal or other significant effects.
* You may have the right to opt-out of the processing (or limit the use) of your sensitive personal information.
* You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your rights described under this section.

These additional rights are subject to exceptions under applicable laws. For example, we may not be able to honor certain rights requests without taking reasonable steps to verify your identity.

If you would like to exercise these rights under applicable state privacy laws, you or your authorized agent have two options for doing so:

* **Call Us:** You may call us at our toll-free number, **1-833-548-0119**; or
* **Submit Through Our Portal:** You may submit your request through our secure web portal, [http://mydata.pepsico.com](http://mydata.pepsico.com/).

We may reasonably verify your request by asking you to provide information to confirm your identity. This information may vary depending on your relationship with us. If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that recognizes the ability to use an authorized agent and wish to contact us through an authorized agent, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. 

If you are in a jurisdiction that recognizes your ability to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your attempt to assert a right under applicable laws, you may submit a request to appeal through our secure web portal, [http://mydata.pepsico.com](http://mydata.pepsico.com/).

Please provide the state that you are writing from, accompanied with information you may have regarding the matter you are appealing. If your jurisdiction allows you to file a complaint with the state’s Attorney General’s Office regarding any concerns with the result of your appeal request, you may do so by using their online properties.

**How we may sell or share your personal information**

Residents of certain states may also have the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information and the sharing of personal information for targeted advertising. We do not sell your information for money, but our Services may use analytics and advertising technologies, including those provided by advertising partners that use your personal information to serve you targeted advertising that is based on your activity across our Services and third-party websites, apps and services. 

We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.  

If you do not wish for us to sell or share your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, you can opt out by submitting your request through [Your Privacy Choices](http://mydata.pepsico.com/). 

##### Retention of personal information 

We keep the categories of personal information described above for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Notice or otherwise authorized by law. This generally means holding the information for as long as one of the following apply:

* Your personal information is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information;
* Your personal information is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected;
* The information is reasonably required to protect or defend our rights or property (which will generally relate to applicable laws that limit actions in a particular case); or
* We are otherwise required or permitted to keep your information by applicable laws or regulations.

**How does PepsiCo protect and store biometric data?** PepsiCo shall use a reasonable standard of care to store, transmit and protect from disclosure any biometric data collected from you.  

##### Security measures

We use various technical and organizational measures and mechanisms to secure our websites and apps. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.

_Sale or Sharing._ Over the past 12 months, we have worked with advertising partners who assist us with our targeted advertising activities, who may have had access to identifiers, Internet and other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and other personal information.

To the extent we collect precise geolocation information for purposes of performing a Service you have requested, we may be deemed to be collecting data that is “sensitive” under California law. Our use of this data for performing a Service you have requested is consistent with the permitted business purposes in California Civil Code § 1798.100 et seq. and implementing regulations.

If you do not wish for us to sell or share your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, you can opt out by submitting your request through [Your Privacy Choices](http://mydata.pepsico.com/). 

**Financial Incentives** 

We offer PepsiCo Tasty Rewards (“PTR”), a rewards program that provides benefits such as rewards points and discounts to those who opt in by choosing to participate, and other similar promotional programs. Participation in these programs may require you to provide some personal information, such as name, date of birth, address, telephone number, and email address, which we use to operate the program, including to send you offers and discounts, and for the other purposes described in this Notice. Additional information related to PTR is available [here](https://www.tastyrewards.com/en-us). For the full terms and conditions, please review the terms and conditions for the applicable program.  

The incentives associated with PTR and similar programs are designed to reward loyal customers based on the volume of products they purchase from us rather than the value of your personal information. Based on our reasonable and good faith estimate, we receive value from PTR in increased loyalty and purchases.   

You have the right to withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by canceling your participation in PTR or similar programs by contacting us as indicated below.
