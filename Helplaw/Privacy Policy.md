Telephone Consumer Protection Act
---------------------------------

By submitting your Information to us on a Site, you agree that this is an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, as amended (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations. This allows us to contact you via telemarketing even if your telephone number is listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists.

Where you provide “prior express written consent” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), you consent to receive telephone calls, including artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls delivered via automated technology and text and SMS messages to the telephone number(s) that you provided from us and the marketing partners. You are not required to provide this consent to obtain access to the Offers, products or services, and your consent simply allows us to contact you via these means. If you: (a) have your telephone number reassigned to another person; (b) give up your telephone number; (c) port your telephone number to a landline or vice versa; or (d) otherwise stop using that telephone number; you are required to inform us

Merely accessing one of our Sites without providing your express written consent for TCPA purposes does not constitute your consent to receive telemarketing calls or text/SMS messages

To ensure that consumers' inquiries are handled accurately, courteously, and promptly, phone calls between you and Help.Law or any of our partners, affiliates, agents, case managers, paralegals, and/or attorneys may be recorded.

The manner in which these calls or text (SMS) messages are made to you may include, but is not limited to, the use of prerecorded/artificial voice messages and/or an automatic telephone dialing system. You certify, warrant, and represent that the telephone numbers you have provided to us are your contact numbers. You represent that you are permitted to receive calls at each of the telephone numbers you have provided to us. You agree that Morgan & Morgan may send emails to you at any email address you provide us, or use other electronic means of communication to the extent permitted by law.
