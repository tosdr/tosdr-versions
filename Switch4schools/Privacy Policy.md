A “web beacon” is a tiny image, placed on a Web page or e-mail that can report your visit or use.

4. Social and General Information Tools
    ------------------------------------
    
    We would be using several publicly-available tools and information exchange resources, such as (but not limited to) a blog, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, a Microsoft account and others (collectively “Social and General Information Tools”). Any information you provide or share by using the Social and General Information Tools may be read, accessed, collected and used by others.
    
5. Phishing
    --------
    
    Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as “phishing”, are of great concern. You should always suspect when you are being asked for your account information and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system. We will never request your login information, your credit card information, in a non-secure or unsolicited communication (e-mail, phone or otherwise).

    The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service. The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorisation or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.

These tasks include, but not limited to, customer service, technical maintenance, monitoring, email management and communication, database management, billing and payment processing, reporting and analytics. When needed we may disclose information, including Personal Information, to such third parties but we will try to limit the Personal Information disclosed to the minimum necessary to perform their task.
    
10. International Transfer  
    Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside Australia and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer Personal Information to Australia and process it there. All data generated in Australia is stored and kept within Australian sovereign territory. Users from schools and organisations based in other territories will also have their data stored in Australia.

11. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
    ----------------------------------------
    
    We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information, including Personal Information, to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ourselves or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. We may disclose information, including Personal Information, to take precautions against liability. You should also be aware that Providers may be obliged to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities to conform to their professional and legal responsibilities. Specifically, and without limitation, you should be aware that the law requires mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action in the following cases: (a) reported or suspected abuse of a child or vulnerable adult; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm to another person; (d) court-ordered presentation of treatment.
    
12. Data Retention
    --------------
    
    You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your Account by contacting us or by editing it online. If you would like us to delete your Personal Information or any other information from our system, please contact us with such request. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. However, we may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law for legitimate business purposes or for recordkeeping purposes. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, including, without limitation, some data may that may be still archived and stored offline. We are not responsible for removing information from the third parties that we have already legitimately shared Personal Information about you.
    
13. Security
    --------
    
    We are concerned about safeguarding your information. The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. Therefore, we employ measures to protect this information from unauthorised access, use, and disclosure. However, the confidentiality of any communication transmitted through the Platform or stored with us cannot be guaranteed. Please remember that no method of electronic transmission over the Internet or method of storage can be 100% secure.
