1. General Terms and Conditions.
    =============================
    

1. Service Description.  The “Service” consists of Current’s website located at https://currentmusic.us (the “Website”), Current’s mobile applications (each an “App” and, collectively, the “Apps”), and all other online properties provided by Current or any of its affiliates, as each may be updated, relocated, or otherwise modified from time to time, including through networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable software, and mobile device applications, and all intellectual property contained therein.  The Service presently enables or in the future may enable Users (as defined in Section [2.1](#id.3q5sasy)) to access audio only, audio visual and literary content, including when any of the foregoing are made available through Third Party Services (as defined in Section [15](#id.25b2l0r)) (collectively, “Content”) via streaming for real-time listening and via the use of a record feature provided for personal, time-shifted future listening.  The Service may provide an information location tool and presently provides an audio guide service offering access to a selection of indexed radio stations, podcasts, and other streaming content from Third Party Services who are solely responsible for the content included in their transmissions.  The Service may include a functionality that permits Users to obtain Products (as defined in Section [5.3](#id.kgcv8k)) solely for redemption on the Service via the use of Current Credits (as defined in Section [5.1](#id.34g0dwd)) for the time, attention, and data arising from, during and between User’s consumption of Content (e.g., the viewing of or listening to Content).  The Service may also permit Users to record, save, and share certain Content, including by linking the User’s Account (as defined in Section [2.1](#id.1jlao46)) to accounts on third-party platforms.  To the extent a functionality described herein is not presently provided by Current, any Terms specifically governing such functionality will not apply until such functionality is made available to you.  Nothing in this Service Description guarantees that any functionalities described herein will be made available by Current at any time or in all territories where the Service is available, and Current reserves the right to not implement or terminate any implementation of any functionality at any time for any and all users and in all or some territories without notice and without any liability to you.  But we aim to offer you some great functionalities so please visit the Service often to see what new and exciting things we provide.

2. Changes to these Terms.  You understand and agree that Current may change these Terms at any time without prior notice.  Current will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised Terms before continuing to access the Service.  You may read a current, effective copy of these Terms at any time at [https://currentmusic.us/terms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://currentmusic.us/terms&sa=D&ust=1549038150520000).  The revised Terms will become effective at the time of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms.  If any change to these Terms is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service and terminating your Account (as defined in Section [2.1](#id.43ky6rz)).  Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section [1.2](#id.2iq8gzs), no revisions to these Terms will apply to any dispute between you and Current that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.

Additional Terms.  We may require you to agree to additional terms and/or policies that we make available to you from time-to-time in connection with your use of the Service, including, without limitation, any such terms that apply to contests that we run on the Service (“Additional Terms”).  Any such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into and subject to these Terms, and, absent express language to the contrary, these Terms will control in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.

6. Jurisdictional Issues.  The Service is controlled and operated by Current from its offices in the State of Illinois.  Current makes no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate, lawful or available for use in any locations other than the United States of America.  Those who choose to access or use the Service from locations outside the United States of America do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.  Access to the Service from jurisdictions where the contents or practices of the Service are illegal, unauthorized or penalized is strictly prohibited.

7. Mobile Services.  The Service is or may be made available through computers, connected mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablet computers), and other connected devices (e.g., smart watches, set-top box, etc.) (collectively, “Mobile Services”).  When using the Service through Mobile Services, your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) or mobile carrier’s normal data, messaging and other fees and rates will apply, and you are solely responsible for paying such fees and rates.  Further, downloading, installing or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.  You are therefore solely responsible for confirming with your ISP or mobile carrier whether the Mobile Services are available to you and your devices, what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and what the cost will be to you for the Mobile Services.

5. Current Credits.
    ================
    

1. Introduction; Not Currency.  In order to reward Users for certain activities on the Service and to enable Users to obtain certain premium Services, Current, in its sole discretion, may offer Users the ability to purchase a license to our in-app virtual currency (“Current Credits”) that may be used to acquire virtual goods and services solely within the Service.  However, while we may use terms like “buy,” “purchase,” or “sell” in reference to Current Credits, such terminology is merely for convenience and does not mean that Current Credits has any particular value.  When you earn or purchase Current Credits, you obtain a license to Current Credits, which operate as virtual currency solely within the Service, and Current Credits do not (i) have an equivalent value in fiat currency; (ii) act as a substitute for fiat currency; or (iii) earn interest.  Current only transmits Current Credits as required to provide the Service as described in these Terms, which does not include money transmission services.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY CARRIER, SERVICE PROVIDER, OR THIRD PARTY SERVICE, AND ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY CARRIER, SERVICE PROVIDER, THIRD PARTY SERVICE, OR OTHER THIRD PARTY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OTHER USER, IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH THIRD PARTY, AND YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE CURRENT AND ITS AFFILIATES AND CURRENT’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND ASSIGNS (THE “CURRENT PARTIES”) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.  

13. Force Majeure.
    ==============
    

1. Current will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation herein if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that are beyond Current’s reasonable control, such as, by way of example and not limitation, strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, epidemic, or governmental action, in so far as such an event prevents or delays Current in fulfilling its obligations hereunder.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

14. Indemnification and Release.
    ============================
    

1. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you will defend, indemnify, and hold the Current Parties harmless against any loss or damage of any kind (including, without limitation, reasonable accounting and attorneys’ fees and lost revenues) arising from: (i) any and all breaches by you of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein; (ii) any and all use of the Service, Proprietary Materials, Marks, and Third Party Marks; (iii) your User Content; and (iv) any and all claims and actions against Current by other parties to whom you allow access to the Service.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

15. Third Party Services.
    =====================
    

The Service may contain content or information about content, products, and services provided by third parties, and links (including, but not limited to, advertisements and sound recordings of musical works) to third party content or web sites (“Third Party Services”). This content and information and these links for Third Party Services are provided only as a convenience to Users, and may not be appropriate or suitable for all audiences. Current does not review or control the content and information available from Third Party Services or these Third Party Services, and Current does not make any representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding this content and information or these Third Party Services. Inclusion of any of the foregoing in the Service does not constitute or imply an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation by or with Current with respect to any third party or its web site or content, or any information, products, or services provided by that third party. Current is under no obligation to maintain any link on the Service and may remove a link at any time in its sole discretion for any reason whatsoever.  YOU LISTEN TO AND CONSUME ALL CONTENT ON THIRD PARTY SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED BY MATURE, CRUDE, RUDE OR INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICE OR CHOOSE THE THIRD PARTY SERVICES YOU LISTEN TO CAREFULLY.  THIS APPLIES EVEN MORE SO IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THIRD PARTY SERVICES WHILE IN THE PRESENCE OF MINORS.

YOU INDEMNIFY AND HOLD CURRENT HARMLESS FROM ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE.   

16. Dispute Resolution.
    ===================
    

1. Generally.  In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Current in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Current agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CURRENT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.  
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
2. Exceptions.  Despite the provisions of Section [16.1](#id.40ew0vw) above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of law; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
3. Arbitrator.  Any arbitration between you and Current will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Current.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
4. Notice; Process.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or electronic mail within the applicable statute of limitations period (“Notice”).  Current’s address for Notice is: Current Media LLC, 213 West Institute Place, Suite 307, Chicago, IL, 60610, United States of America.  The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Current may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Current must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by Current prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Current will pay you the highest of the following: (X) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (Y) the last written settlement amount offered by Current in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (Z) $15,000.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
5. Fees.  If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then Current will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Chicago, Illinois, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  In that case, you agree to reimburse Current for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
6. No Class Actions.  YOU AND CURRENT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN CLAIMS WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION [17](#id.2fk6b3p)).  Further, unless both you and Current agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
7. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.  Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if Current makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Current’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Current’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Current.  If you do not send such written notice, then your continued use of the Service following any such change means that you have consented to such change.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
8. Enforceability.  If Section [16.6](#id.upglbi) above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section [1](#id.3ep43zb)6 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section [16](#id.1tuee74) will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described directly below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

17. Governing Law; Choice of Forum.
    ===============================
    

The laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Service.  Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws; provided, however, that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any provision of these Terms.  To the extent that any action relating to any dispute hereunder is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such action will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois and you hereby irrevocably submit to personal jurisdiction in such courts, and waive any defense of inconvenient forum.

18. Feedback.
    =========
    

While we are continually working to develop and evaluate our own product ideas and features, we know we don’t have all the answers.  We therefore welcome your feedback, comments, and suggestions.  If you choose to contribute by sending Current or our employees any ideas for products, services, features, modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies, content offerings (such as audio, visual, games, or other types of content), promotions, strategies, or product/feature names or any related documentation, artwork, computer code, diagrams, or other materials (collectively “Feedback”), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may say, the following terms will apply, so that future misunderstandings can be avoided.  Accordingly, by sending Feedback to Current, you agree that:  

9. Current has no obligation to review, consider or implement your Feedback, or to return to you all or part of any Feedback for any reason;
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
10. Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis, and Current is not under any obligation to keep any Feedback you send confidential or to refrain from using or disclosing it in any way; and
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
11. You irrevocably grant Current perpetual and unlimited permission to Use the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback, whether in whole or in part, and whether as provided or as modified.

1. Entire Agreement; Variation.  These Terms set forth the entire agreement between Current and you with respect to the Service.  These Terms supersede and govern all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into these Terms.  No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter these Terms.  Except as set forth in Section [1.2](#id.4du1wux), these Terms may be changed only by a written amendment signed by an authorized agent of each party.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
2.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
