1\. General information
-----------------------

![Notepad](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image2.svg)

Welcome to Poki! We are a company based in the Netherlands. You can find more information about us in our [Privacy Statement - UK](https://poki.com/en/c/privacy-statement).

We have made a couple of 'Rules'. These Rules are for everyone that uses our website from the United Kingdom. **If you use our website, these Rules apply to you. If you do not agree to the Rules, don't use our website.**

Each section below contains the most important Rules and simplified information. If you would like to know more, please click on 'more information'. These 'more information' sections do include more difficult language, but are also applicable to you. If you don't understand the rules completely, please ask your parents or the people taking care of you to help you understand our Rules! And of course, you can also ask us.

If you want more information about our Rules, contact us at [hello@poki.com](mailto:hello@poki.com) . We are happy to explain everything to you! Of course, you can also contact us to say something nice üòä We want our website to be a fun place for everyone. If you respect these Rules, you'll help us with that!

Welcome to Poki! In this document we explain our Rules, more formally called Terms of Use. In these more complicated more-information-parts, we stick to the formal reference of Terms of Use. These Terms of Use apply to our users from the United Kingdom ('UK')\* visiting poki.com ('Website'). Poki.com is owned and operated by Poki B.V. (also referred to as 'Poki', 'we', 'our' or 'us'). Poki is an entity established under the laws of the Netherlands. Besides these Terms of Use, our Privacy Statement ‚Äì UK is also applicable to our users from the UK.

The Website may include access to virtual environments, games and other content for use on personal computers, tablets, mobile devices or phones. All users of the Website ('Website Visitors') are subject to the following terms and conditions of use (these 'Terms of Use').

Please read these Terms of Use carefully before accessing or using any part of this Website. **By accessing or using this Website, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, as updated from time to time by Poki**. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, do not access or use any part of this Website.

Poki may change and update these Terms of Use at any time. If we do so, we will notify you by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Website. Your continued use of the Website means that you accept and agree to the changed Terms of Use. If you disagree with the Terms of Use or are dissatisfied with this Website, your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using this Website.

_\* Please note that we determine from which region you visit our website based on your IP-address. Thus, if you use a VPN-connection, you may not be shown the Terms of Use applicable to you._

2\. Age

![Cake](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image14.svg)

We wish to make sure this website is privacy-friendly for all players. Poki has therefore created the Privacy-Friendly Mode. The Privacy-Friendly Mode is for all ages. When you go to our website, you are already in the Privacy-Friendly Mode. In the Privacy-Friendly Mode we only show family-friendly ads. Read more about our Privacy-Friendly Mode in our [Privacy Statement - UK](https://poki.com/en/c/privacy-statement).

3\. Use of the website
----------------------

![Computer](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image13.svg)

Don't do anything bad or mean to others, when you use our website. What does that mean? It means you shouldn't do things that are against the law in any country. You also shouldn't act against our Rules. Here are some examples of what you shouldn't do:

* Don't put up mean or rude things on our website like words or pictures that can make someone else feel bad.
* Don't share someone's private information without asking them first.
* Don't pretend to be someone you're not.
* Don't use our website to copy and share pictures or games that belong to other people. It's not fair and it's
against their rights.* Don't use our website to do bad things like hacking, sending spam, or spreading viruses.
* Don't try to find out personal information about other people who use the website.
* Don't be mean or bully other people who use the website.
* And remember, if there's anything else that goes against the Rules, don't do it!

Sometimes, people write things on our website that we don't necessarily agree with. So, remember that what you read might be someone else's opinion, not ours. And when you share something on our website, you are the one responsible for it. Also, always remember that whatever you post on our website is your responsibility. If you don't follow our Rules, we might have to stop you from using our website.

By uploading or otherwise transmitting material to any area of the Website, you warrant that the material is your own or is in the public domain or otherwise free of proprietary or other restrictions and that you have the right to post it to the Website.

4\. Privacy: protection of personal data
----------------------------------------

![Shield](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image17.svg)

If you want to know more about how we use your data, take a look at our [Privacy Statement - UK](https://poki.com/en/c/privacy-statement).

5\. Data charges
----------------

![Coins](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image10.svg)

Our website is free to use, but you may have to pay for the internet. When you use the internet, your parents or the people taking care of you may have to pay the internet bill. This is because the internet provider charges them for the time you spend online.

So, if you want to use our website, make sure to ask your parents or the people taking care of you first. You should check with them if they are okay with you visiting our website. They may need to know how long and how often you want to visit our website.

We are not responsible for paying the internet bill. If your parents or the people taking care of you get a bill that is higher than normal, it is not because of us. It is because you spent more time on the internet. üòâ

For more information click here:

To the extent that your use of the Website requires, or permits utilization of, wireless, cellular data, or internet access, you are independently responsible for securing the necessary data access service. For example, with respect to your mobile devices, the provider of your data plan may charge you data access fees in connection with your use of the Website. You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties.

6\. Copyright restriction / use of content
------------------------------------------

![Copyright](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image15.svg)

The things on our website are basically 'our stuff', or from other parties that we work with. You are not allowed to use any content from our website, without asking us first. For example, you cannot copy the logo of a game and use it for your own website. If the data is copied by your device automatically for technical reasons so that you can use our website in the normal way, this is not a violation of our Rules.

For more information click here:

The entire contents of this Website (including all information, text, displays, images and audio and any software made available through or in connection with the Website) and the design, selection and arrangement thereof, are proprietary to Poki or its affiliates or licensors and are protected by UK and international laws regarding copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights.

7\. Software and downloads
--------------------------

![Download](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image8.svg)

Sometimes it is possible to download something from our website. This does not mean that this is now 'your' stuff. You cannot do with it whatever you want: we are still the 'owners'; it's still our stuff.

8\. Access and interference
---------------------------

![Access](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image11.svg)

We want our website to work smoothly and properly. It's therefore important not to do anything that might make our website stop working right.

This for example includes so-called robots, spiders or other software that may hamper the functioning of our website. Also please do not try to (automatically) refresh the webpage super quickly many times in a row. Just be patient and give it a little time.

![Trademarks](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image16.svg)

The name 'Poki', the special Poki image, and everything else about Poki on our website belongs to us. It's like having a special mark that only we can use. That means you can't use the 'Poki' name or image without asking us first.

It may be that someone complains about what you did and blames us because you broke the Rules. In that case, you (or your parents or the people taking care of you) will protect us and hold us harmless. That means you would have to pay for any harm or damage that happened because of your actions. It's a good idea to avoid breaking these Rules to prevent any problems like that.

![Money](https://a.poki.com/privacy/termsofuse/image5.svg)
