Part I. Terms and Conditions for WU mobile application (“**WU App**”) Subscriptions

(NOTE: The terms and conditions in this Part I. apply to subscription offerings for the WU App, and not the Weather Underground Site.  See Part II. for Terms and Conditions for wunderground.com subscriptions.)

Users purchase subscriptions for the WU App trough the Apple App Store, the Google Play store, or other platform stores, and such purchases are governed by the terms and conditions of those platform marketplaces ("Platform Operators"). Please contact those Platform Operators in connection with any issues regarding payments, renewals and refunds.   Contact WU Customer Support regarding the content, features and functionality provided under your subscription, including any technical support issues. If you are unable to resolve any issues regarding payments, renewals and refunds with your Platform Operator, please contact support@wunderground.com and we will attempt to assist you.

Part II. Terms and Conditions for wunderground.com Subscriptions

(NOTE: The terms and conditions in this Part II. apply to subscription offerings for the wunderground.com website.)

1.  
    1. General Terms and Conditions. By purchasing the any subscription on wunderground.com (all subscriptions are “Services”), you accept and agree to be bound by these Subscriber Agreement terms, which are part of and incorporate the Terms.
    2. The Services are available only in the U.S.A. By subscribing to any Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age or older. If you are under the age of majority in your country, state or territory, you represent that you either are an emancipated minor or you have obtained the legal consent of your parent or legal guardian to enter into this Subscriber Agreement, which forms a binding contract between you and WU.  You authorize WU to collect, use, share and store the information you provide upon registration and thereafter in accordance with WU’s Privacy Policy. By subscribing, you represent and warrant that your email address and any other information that you choose to provide is accurate, and you agree to update such information as necessary. You acknowledge and agree that WU may rely on the use of your log-in credentials (such as an email address along with a password) to provide access to your account and the information you have provided. You are responsible for all use of your account and for ensuring that all use complies with this Subscriber Agreement.
2. SUBSCRIPTION AND AUTO RENEWAL. Subscriptions to the Services are provided on a specific billing period such as monthly or yearly, and unless otherwise noted in the terms of your offer, your subscription will continue and automatically renew at the end of the billing period you choose, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. Payment for the first billing period in the amount shown to you at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes) will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase, and because your subscription automatically renews, payment for each additional billing period (plus applicable taxes) will then be charged at the start of each additional billing period, unless you cancel your subscription. For subscriptions with a yearly billing period or longer, we will notify you at least thirty (30) days prior to your subscription renewal, except as otherwise required by law. Unless we notify you in advance of a price change as further described below, the renewal rate for each additional billing period will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior billing period unless you received promotional or discount pricing as disclosed to you as part of a specific offer (for example, offers for a discounted first month or first year rate). At any time, you can stop your subscription from renewing for an additional billing period after the then-current billing period by canceling your subscription as described below.
3. CANCELLATION. You may cancel the renewal of any Services at any time at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period or free trial period, and the cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period or free trial. Please note that you will not receive a prorated refund of charges for the current billing period, but you will continue to have access to the service through the end of the current billing period (through the end of the month, for a monthly subscription, or year, for an annual subscription).To cancel, you may log in to your account at wunderground.com, select My Profile, select Member Settings and click on the Subscriptions tab, and follow the prompts to cancel, or you may email WU Customer Support at support@wunderground.com indicating your choice to cancel.
4. PRICE CHANGES. We reserve the right to change the price of your subscription for billing periods after your then-current billing period. In the event of a price change, we will provide reasonable notice to you before the price change, such as by emailing you or by providing notice when you visit weatherunderground.com, as required by law. If you do not agree to the changed price for future billing periods, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with the instructions for cancellation above. If you do not cancel your subscription after notice of the price change and prior to the start of your new billing period, your subscription will be renewed at the price in effect at the time of the renewal, without any additional action by you, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for the new price (plus applicable taxes).
5. PAYMENT METHODS; BILLING. WU uses a third party payment processor (“Payment Processor”) to bill the payment method you provide upon purchase. WU may accept various forms of payment for subscriptions. The terms of your payment will be based on your payment method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method. By submitting an order to purchase Services, you authorize WU, or its Payment Processor, to charge your specified account for the purchase amount and to share any payment information and instructions required to complete the payment transactions (e.g., credit card transaction processing, merchant settlement, and related services) with the Payment Processor. Processing of your payments is subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. WU is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.
6. FREE TRIALS. From time to time in our discretion, we may offer free trials allowing you to enjoy a subscription to specified Services for a specified time period at no charge. With a free trial offer, you provide a payment method and authorize us to charge the subscription price (plus applicable taxes) to your payment method and begin your paid subscription if you do not cancel (according to the instructions for cancellation above) before the free trial ends. You can cancel the free trial subscription without incurring any charges any time up until 24 hours before the end of your free trial. Unless otherwise required by law, you will not receive a notice that your free trial is about to end or has ended, or that your paid subscription has begun. Availability of a free trial is not guaranteed and, if available, may only be available to those who have not previously accepted a free trial offer for any Services, at our discretion.
7. SUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS. From time to time, we may offer different subscription options, including subscriptions to third-party products and services or subscription bundles that include subscriptions offered by WU along with those offered by third parties. If you choose to purchase such offerings, you agree that we may charge your payment method on file for any included third-party products and services.
8. REFUND POLICY. All subscriptions are non-refundable unless otherwise required by law. We do not provide refunds or credits, including for partially used billing periods, such as in the event that you decide to delete your weather.com account, which would prevent you from being able to sign in and access the Services. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period (through the end of the month, for a monthly subscription, or year, for an annual subscription), but your subscription will not renew for an additional billing period.
9. SERVICE LIMITATIONS. The number of simultaneous logged in sessions to any Services is currently limited to three (3) sessions. We reserve the right to disable your access to the Services if we notice excessive sessions or other unusual activity using your account. The number of simultaneous sessions available for use may change from time to time at our discretion.
10. SUBSCRIPTIONS OBTAINED THROUGH THIRD PARTIES. If you subscribe to any Services through a third party, your subscription is subject to any terms and conditions provided to you by that third party and any conflicting terms in this Subscriber Agreement do not apply. Your billing relationship is with the third party, so any inquiries regarding purchase, billing, cancellation or refunds should be directed to the third party. To cancel a subscription obtained via a third party, you must follow the cancellation instructions provided by the third party.
11. CHANGES TO SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT. WU may modify the terms and conditions of this Subscriber Agreement in its discretion. WU will notify you of significant modifications by email or by providing notice on the https://www.wunderground.com website. Modifications shall be effective immediately; provided however, for existing subscribers, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective thirty (30) days after notice has been provided to you.
