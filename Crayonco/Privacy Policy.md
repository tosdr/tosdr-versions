We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you are under 18, do not use or provide any information on this Website or on or through any of its features, use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please [contact us](#A10).

It is important that you read this Privacy Policy together with any other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your information. This Privacy Policy supplements other privacy notices and is not intended to override them.

We have appointed a data privacy manager who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will post the revised Privacy Policy to our Website and the last revision date of revision will be updated so that you will always be able to understand what information we collect, how we use your information, and under what circumstances we may share your information with others. We will notify you of any material changes via an email or by way of a pop-up notice on the Website announcing that the Privacy Policy has changed and bringing the changes to your attention.  

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us.

Third-party links 

This Website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our Website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

2\. The Information We Collect About You
----------------------------------------

Personal information means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal information about our visitors, customers and applicants which we have grouped together as follows:

* **Identity Data** includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, title, ethnicity (voluntary for applicants), sex (voluntary for applicants – including gender, gender identity, gender expression).
* **Contact Data** includes postal address, billing address, email address and telephone numbers.
* **Financial Data** includes credit card and financial information to process payment for services (if applicable).
* **Transaction Data** includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.
* **Technical Data** includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this Website.

We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from your personal information but is not considered personal information in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal information so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal information which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses.

If You Fail to Provide Personal Information

Where we need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with Services). In this case, we may have to cancel a Service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

3\. How Is Your Personal Information Collected?
-----------------------------------------------

We use different methods to collect information from and about you including through:

* **Direct interactions.** You may give us your Identity, Contact and Financial Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal information you provide when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of our Website (e.g., posting, sharing, sending and receiving comments through our Services), fill out a form, make a purchase, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.
* **Automated technologies or interactions.** As you interact with our Website, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, its location, your browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal information by using cookies, server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies. Please see our [cookie policy](https://www.crayon.co/cookie-policy) for further details.

* Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
* Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
* Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.

Click [here](#A12) to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal information.

Third-party marketing

We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal information with any company outside Crayon for marketing purposes, including service providers who perform marketing services on our behalf, such as sending communications to you on our behalf.

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal information provided to us as a result of purchasing or using our Services, a Service support experience or other transactions.

In addition, some content or applications on the Website may be served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.

Our Website also provides you access to certain content facilitated by APIs provided by third party social media providers, as indicated in our Third Party API Notices page, available at [https://www.crayon.co/third-party-api-notices](https://www.crayon.co/third-party-api-notices). The privacy policies of the companies providing such APIs are applicable to your interaction with our Website’s content provided via such APIs.

Change of purpose

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

5\. Disclosures of Your Personal Information
--------------------------------------------

We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table [_Purposes for which we will use your personal data_](#A4) above.

* Third Parties as set out in the [_Glossary_](#A12).
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

6\. International Transfers
---------------------------

We largely operate in the United States (“U.S.”), and therefore, if you reside outside of the U.S. you understand and agree that your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in, the U.S. by us and our third party hosting providers. Furthermore, you understand that U.S. law may not afford the same level of protection to personal information as those afforded in your country. Personal information may be transferred for the performance of a contract or as required for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request or to establish or exercise our legal rights.

If you are based in the European Union and when we are given access to your personal information by one of our clients in connection with services we provide to them, then we rely on our client data controllers’ written instructions to ensure that any transfer of your personal information to us and to our service providers based outside the European Economic Area is performed in accordance with applicable EU law.

7\. Data Security
-----------------

We have put in place appropriate security [measures](https://app.vanta.com/crayon/trust/vabogpy2n3q9cp9hicshd) to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for Crayon or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to assure or restore the integrity of the data system. Crayon may delay notification if Crayon or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, unless and until Crayon or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at [privacy@crayon.co](mailto:privacy@crayon.co)

8\. Data Retention
------------------

How long will you use my personal information for?

We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your information: see _your rights and choices_ below for further information.

In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

9\. Your Rights With Respect to Your Personal Information
---------------------------------------------------------

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:

* [_Request access to your personal information_](#A13)
* [_Request correction of your personal information_](#A14)
* [_Request erasure of your personal information_](#A15)
* [_Object to processing of your personal information_](#A16)
* [_Request restriction of processing your personal information_](#A17)
* [_Request transfer of your personal information_](#A18)
* [_Right to withdraw consent_](#A19)

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at [privacy@crayon.co](mailto:privacy@crayon.co).

No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

Time limit to respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

-----------------------------------

Crayon complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and/or the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework(s) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and/or Switzerland, to the United States.  Crayon has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, the Data Privacy Framework Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

In compliance with the Data Privacy Framework Principles, Crayon commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. European Union and/or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Data Privacy Framework policy should first contact Crayon at [privacy@crayon.co](mailto:privacy@crayon.co).

Crayon has further committed to refer unresolved Data Privacy Framework complaints to JAMS ADR, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit [https://www.jamsadr.com/submit](https://www.jamsadr.com/submit) for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of JAMS ADR are provided at no cost to you.

An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) raise the claimed violation directly with Crayon and afford us an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3) raise the issue through their Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to the individual. This arbitration option may not be invoked if the individual’s same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously settled by the parties.

In addition, this option may not be invoked if an EU Data Protection Authority or the Commissioner (1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of the Principles; or (2) has the authority to resolve the claimed violation directly with Crayon. A DPA’s, or the Commissioner's authority to resolve the same claim against an EU or a Swiss data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this arbitration option against a different legal entity not bound by the DPA or Commissioner's authority.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Crayon’s compliance with the Data Privacy Framework.

In the context of an onward transfer, Crayon has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Data Privacy Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Crayon shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

While Crayon is a Data Privacy Framework participant, Crayon does not rely on Data Privacy Framework in order to lawfully transfer data from non-US locations into the US.

### LAWFUL BASIS

Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

Performance of Contract means processing your information where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

Comply with a legal obligation means processing your personal information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.

Consent means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal information relating to you.

### THIRD PARTIES

* Service providers acting as processors who provide IT, payment processing, analytics, and system administration services. Please refer to Crayon’s list of [Sub-Processors / Service Providers](https://www.crayon.co/sub-processors).
* Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.

### YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

You have the right to:

Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.

Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with applicable law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:

* If you want us to establish the information's accuracy.
* Where our use of the information is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.
* Where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
* You have objected to our use of your information, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
