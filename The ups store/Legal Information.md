 **Information We Obtain**

The types of personal information that we may obtain include:

* Individual and business contact information (such as name, company name, physical address, email address, and telephone or fax number);
* Payment information (including payment card details);
* Information about your transactions with us, such as products and services you purchase;
* Information provided in response to surveys;
* Username, password and other credentials used to access The UPS Store products and services, including information in your public social media profile if you register via a social media website or tool;
* The geographic location of your mobile device if you access our Services via a mobile device;
* Information you may upload to our Services, such as information contained in documents you upload for printing services;
* Personal information of other individuals that you provide to us; and
* Other personal information that may be provided to us to obtain a The UPS Store product or service.

We collect this personal information from you as well as from our franchisees, publicly available databases, providers of small business contact data, and our joint marketing partners. If you disclose any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

In addition, when you visit our Services or interact with The UPS Store-related tools, widgets or plug-ins, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as IP address (from which we may derive your approximate location), unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken, and dates and times of activity. When you download and use an App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

When you visit our Services, this information may be collected through “cookies” and “web beacons.” A “cookie” is a text file sent to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages or applications to web servers and may be used to transmit information back to a web server. Through our automated collection efforts, The UPS Store obtains and stores “clickstream data” to tell us usage patterns.

With your permission, we may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.

We also may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers help us analyze how visitors use the Services and may also collect information regarding your use of other websites, apps and online resources. The information obtained for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and exercise the opt-out provided by Google by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Services. Our service providers may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities, over time and across third-party websites, when using our Services. Our Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.

The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as Facebook “Like” buttons, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers.

**How We Use The Information We Obtain**

We may use the information we obtain to:

* Provide and arrange for products and services you request, such as printing and package tracking services;
* Process and collect payments;
* Provide customer support and respond to and communicate with you about your requests, questions and comments;
* Communicate with you about products and services we believe may interest you;
* Communicate about, and administer your participation in, special events, programs, webinars, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, and other offers or promotions;
* Establish and manage your accounts;
* Verify your identity;
* Enable you to post on our blogs;
* Send information to your contacts if you ask us to do so;
* Process claims we receive in connection with products and services you request;
* Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; managing our communications; determining the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and advertising; analyzing and enhancing our products and services; and performing accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation and collection activities);
* Perform data analyses (including market and consumer research, trend analysis and financial analysis);
* Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities; and

In addition, The UPS Store uses information collected online through cookies, web beacons and other automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users’ visits to our Services, (ii) delivering content (including advertising) tailored to our users’ interests and the manner in which our users browse our Services, and (iii) managing our business. We also use this information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer our Services, identify users of our Services, and gather demographic information about our users. We use clickstream data to determine usage patterns and how we may tailor our Services to better meet the needs of our users.

The UPS Store also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

**Interest-Based Advertising**

On our Services, The UPS Store or our vendors may collect information about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

You may see certain ads on other websites because The UPS Store participates in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn about how to opt out of this ad network interest-based advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, click [here](http://optout.aboutads.info/#/) and [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/). To opt out in mobile apps, you may download the AppChoices app [here](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices).

**Information We Disclose**

The UPS Store does not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice. The UPS Store discloses personal information to third parties who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. These third parties are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We also may disclose information to our affiliates, resellers, shipping carriers, and joint marketing partners.

By using the Services, you may elect to disclose personal information, for example, on blogs, chat, and other services to which you are able to post information and content. Please note that any information you post or disclose through the Services will become public and may be available to other users and the general public. You may also elect to disclose personal information through your social sharing activity. If you register via your social media account, you will disclose information to your friends associated with your social media account, with other users, and with your social media account provider. By registering, you authorize us to facilitate this disclosure of information, and you understand that the use of disclosed information will be governed by the social media provider’s privacy policy.

Information collected through third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins (such as information obtained through third-party login services or relating to your use of a Facebook “Like” button) is collected directly by the providers of these features. This information is subject to the privacy policies of the providers of the features, and The UPS Store is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.

The UPS Store also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. The UPS Store reserves the right to transfer any information we have about you in connection with the sale or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).

**Non-The UPS Store Places and Services**

For your convenience and information, the Services may contain links to non-The UPS Store places that may be operated by companies not affiliated with The UPS Store. The inclusion of such links does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates. These companies may have their own privacy policies or notices, which we strongly suggest you review. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any non-The UPS Store places or services.

In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Apps.

**How We Protect Personal Information**

The UPS Store seeks to use reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no information transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “How To Contact Us” section below.
