This Privacy Policy is intended to inform all Users about how the Data Controller treats Personal Information and Non-personal Information. If any User does not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, then the Data Controller cannot provide the Services to such User, and such User should stop accessing the same.

**_Non-personal Information_** means any such Personal Information which the Data Controller takes and makes it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating one User’s information with another User’s information), or by removing characteristics (such as User’s name) that make the information personally identifiable to such User (hence de-personalizing the information).

A reasonable fee shall be charged to offset the Data Controller’s administrative and actual costs incurred in complying with the relevant data access requests.
