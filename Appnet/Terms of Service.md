15\. FEES AND PAYMENTS
----------------------

You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased at this Site at the time you order the Services. All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term. Mobiblocks expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you. If you have purchased Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. Where refunds are issued, Mobiblocks' issuance of a refund receipt is confirmation that Mobiblocks has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale. You acknowledge and agree that the associated payment provider and/or individual issuing bank establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund. Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by PayPal (as defined below). For Services that offer quick payment methods, clicking the button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Account. Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Account. If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the date of the month you purchased the Services unless that date falls after the 28th of the month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month. In an effort to ensure that there is no interruption of Services, Mobiblocks may participate in “recurring billing programs” or “account updater services” supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank’s participation). If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us. In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, Mobiblocks will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf. Mobiblocks makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to **(I)** setting your renewal options and **(II)** ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid. Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and Mobiblocks shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. If for any reason Mobiblocks is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Mobiblocks is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Mobiblocks may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. If you pay by credit card and if for any reason Mobiblocks is unable to charge your credit card with the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Mobiblocks is charged back for any fee it previously charged to the credit card you provided, you agree that Mobiblocks may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that the remedies Mobiblocks may pursue in order to effect payment shall include, but not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to you of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. Mobiblocks reserves the right to charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing fees” for **(I)** tasks Mobiblocks may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, **(II)** additional time and/or costs Mobiblocks may incur in providing its Services, and/or **(III)** your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Mobiblocks in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical scenarios include, but are not limited to, customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention, fees incurred by third-party payment providers such as PayPal, fees incurred as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank, or a Payment Method processor, and disputes that require accounting or legal services. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with Mobiblocks. All transactions are processed in U.S. dollars. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees, Value Added Tax (“VAT”), Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section. The “No Setup Fee!” is a special offer for the new customers only. The standard setup fee will be applied for re-activating a cancelled or suspended account. Standard setup fee for re-activation of a cancelled or suspended account is $200.00.

**(A)** PAY BY PAYPAL

By using Mobiblocks’ pay by PayPal payment option (“PayPal”), you can purchase Mobiblocks Services using PayPal. In connection therewith, you agree to allow PayPal to debit the full amount of your purchase from your PayPal account (“PayPal Account”) or from the credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed Payment Method(s) linked to your PayPal Account (“PayPal Funding Source”). It is your responsibility to keep your PayPal Account and PayPal Funding Source current and funded, and your PayPal Account backed by a valid credit card. You acknowledge and agree that **(I)** PayPal reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and **(II)** in such event, neither PayPal nor Mobiblocks shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. If for any reason PayPal is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for your purchase, you agree that PayPal and Mobiblocks may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that if the transaction is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge of $25.00 or the maximum amount allowed by law, which may be debited from your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source.

By clicking the box labeled “I agree” to the terms of the PayPal payment option, you authorize a debit of the full amount of your purchase from your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source.

16\. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
---------------------------

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.

17.CANCELLATION/REFUND POLICY
-----------------------------

After payment, you have a 14-day cancellation period. Should you choose to receive your money back paid on App.net, you will receive a full refund of your payment. Your payment qualifies for a full refund only if paid funds are still available in your balance. If funds have been used by your advertiser campaigns, your funds are considered 'spent' and these funds do not qualify for a refund. If you request a full refund after 14 days you don't qualify for a refund, no matter when your refund request was submitted. Upon refund request, your account will be closed and your advertiser campaigns will be suspended. White label setup fees are non-refundable. There are no cancellation fees and no cancellation penalties.
