Terms of use and privacy policy
===============================

Your use of our website is subject always to the following terms, which incorporate our privacy policy. By using our website, you accept these terms in full. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not use our website.

Who we are
----------

We are Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), the operators of this website, www.antisemitism.org. CAA is a volunteer-led charity dedicated to exposing and countering antisemitism through education and zero-tolerance enforcement of the law. We are a Charitable Incorporated Organisation registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales (number 1163790). You can [contact us](https://antisemitism.org/contact/) through our website.

Collection, use and retention of information
--------------------------------------------

We obtain information about you when you use our website, for example, when you contact us to ask about antisemitism and our work to combat it, make a donation, apply to become a volunteer, or tell us about an antisemitic incident. The personal information we collect might include your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, IP address, social media identifiers and information regarding what pages you accessed on our website, and when. If you make a donation online, your credit card or bank details are not held by us, they are collected by our third-party payment processors, who specialise in the secure online capture and processing of online transactions, as explained below.

We will use your information to promote human rights in relation to the elimination of antisemitism, including raising awareness of the occurrence of antisemitism and providing advocacy, assistance, care and relief in relation to those affected by antisemitism; advance education for the public benefit as regards the history, causes, effects and prevention of antisemitism; promote racial harmony for the public benefit between Jewish people wherever in the world and other members of society by the elimination of antisemitism; prevent or detect crime and/or apprehend or assist the prosecution of offenders; and provide a voluntary service, administer membership records, fundraise, process donations, promote the interests of the charity, fulfil any contractual obligations to you, manage our employees and volunteers, maintain our own accounts and records, seek your views on our work, notify you of changes to our services, send you other information that you have requested and that might be of interest to you and assist you in relation to any antisemitic incidents that you report to us.

We review how long we retain personal information for on a regular basis. We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory obligations (for example we are required to retain donation details to justify the collection of Gift Aid). We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract that you hold with us.

Organisations are permitted to process personal information if they have a legal basis for doing so. We processes personal information mainly on the lawful basis of our legitimate interest (or those of a third party) in exposing and countering antisemitism through education and zero-tolerance enforcement of the law and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Other legal bases are: expressed and informed consent given by the person whose data is being processed; necessity in relation to a contract or agreement which the person has entered into or because the person has asked for something to be done so they can enter into a contract or agreement; legal obligation on us to process data. Children of any age have the same rights over the personal information processed about them as adults, although their ability to understand and to exercise these rights may vary depending on their age and capacity. We therefore ask those legally responsible for any children with whom we engage to understand that our obligations are to each of those children separately as individual data subjects and to work with us accordingly. Where we rely solely on consent as the basis for processing personal information, we are required to obtain your explicit consent and you can modify or withdraw this consent at any time by [contacting us](https://antisemitism.org/contact/), although this may affect the extent to which we are able to provide services to or interact with you in future.

We may change our policy from time to time and any such changes will be published on our website. You are advised to check from time to time that no changes have been made to any sections that are important to you. Notwithstanding any changes to this policy, we will continue to process your personal data in accordance with your rights and our obligations in law. We review how we process information on a regular basis.

Access to information
---------------------

We will not ever sell or rent your information to third parties.

We may pass your information to our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf (for example to process donations and send you e-mails). When we use third-party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we ensure that the terms of service require them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.

When you are using our secure online donation pages, your donation is processed by a third-party payment processor, which specialises in the secure online capture and processing of online transactions. If you have any questions regarding secure transactions, please [contact us](https://antisemitism.org/contact/).

When we are working on your behalf in connection with an antisemitic incident you may have witnessed or suffered, we may want to share your personal information with police, prosecutors, regulators, legal and other paralegal professionals. Where we do this, it is only with your express consent to share your personal information.

We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of any restructuring or reorganisation of CAA, or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our supporters, partners, volunteers or those we are helping. However, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

Choosing to receive information from us
---------------------------------------

You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. If you do not want to receive communications from us about the vital work we do in combating antisemitism, our fundraising appeals and opportunities to support us, you can change your communication preferences by clicking on the link at the bottom of our e-mails and selecting your preferences by ticking the relevant boxes. Alternatively, you can change your preferences at any time by [contacting us](https://antisemitism.org/contact/).

Accessing and updating your information
---------------------------------------

The accuracy of your information is important to us. At the bottom of all of our update e-mails, you will find a link to access or change your information. Alternatively, if you change your e-mail address, or any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please [contact us](https://antisemitism.org/contact/). You have the right to ask for a copy of the information that we hold about you. A small fee may be payable if an information request is particularly onerous. If we hold information about you, you have the right to be informed about the data we hold about you; access the information we hold about you; have your personal information corrected if it is incomplete or inaccurate; ask us to restrict how we process your information; and object to certain ways we use your information. In some circumstances, you may have a right to object to us processing your information. To see the rights available to you, please refer to the website of the Information Commissioner’s Office. If you want to raise a concern about how we have handled your information, you can make a complaint to us by [contacting us](https://antisemitism.org/contact/). You also have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.

Information security
--------------------

When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it is treated securely. Any sensitive information (such as credit or debit card details) is encrypted and protected using SSL. When you are on a secure page, a lock icon will appear on your internet browser.

However, when you e-mail is, that e-mail might be transmitted normally over the internet, which can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we do our best to ensure that it is held securely on our systems. Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping that password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Profiling
---------

We may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you. We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us to do this effectively. We may also use your personal information to detect and reduce fraud and credit risk.

Cookies
-------

Our website uses cookies, small text files that are placed on your machine to store your preferences, store information for online processes, such as donation, and provide anonymised tracking data to third party applications that we use, such as Google Analytics. As a rule, cookies will make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on this website and on others. The most effective way to do this is to disable cookies in your browser. We suggest consulting the ‘Help’ section of your browser or taking a look at [About Cookies](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) which offers guidance for all modern browsers. Turning cookies off may result in a loss of functionality when using our website.

Rewards
-------

Where rewards are offered for information in criminal cases, the reward will be payable upon us determining, at our discretion, that there has been a successful conviction as a result of the information that you provided, and only after the deadline to appeal such a conviction has passed. If you contact the police directly and do not also contact us, you may be ineligible for the reward, given that we may be unable to contact you or determine that it was your information that led to the conviction.

Links to other websites
-----------------------

Our website contains links to other websites run by other organisations. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites that you visit. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites even if you access them using links from our website. Articles on this website may include embedded content (such as videos).

In addition, if you accessed our website from a third-party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third-party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third-party website.

Users aged 16 or under
----------------------

We wish to protect the privacy of children aged 16 or under. If you are aged 16 or under‚ please get your parent or guardian’s permission before providing us with personal information.

Transferring your information outside the EU
--------------------------------------------

As part of the services offered to you through this website, the information which you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union (EU). For example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EU. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. By submitting your personal information, you are agreeing to this transfer, storage or processing. If we transfer your information outside of the EU, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.
