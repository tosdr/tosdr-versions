Subject to these Terms, the Company grants to you and you accept, a limited, personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable, royalty-free license to use the Website and view the information, content, and materials contained on the Website (the “Materials”) and make such copies of the Materials only as may be incidentally created during your exercise of the foregoing through the normal operation of a commercially available web browser and a gateway cache and proxy obtaining the Materials from the Company’s server.

The Company reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website or any part thereof with or without notice or to suspend, remove or disable access to the Website. You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Website and for any claims, costs or damages arising therefrom. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor your use of the Website and your account. In the event that we determine in our sole discretion that any such use violates these Terms, including our related Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to block your use of the Website and become involved in disputes between you and other third parties in connection with any such violation and these Terms.

THIRD PARTY MATERIALS

The Website includes software or other materials developed by third parties.

THIRD PARTY SITES

Use of the Website may include or link to websites provided by a third party service provider (“Third Party Sites”). Your use of Third Party Sites shall be solely between you and the third party and subject to the applicable terms and conditions from such third party. We hereby disclaim all responsibility and liability for your use of Third Party Sites, including but not limited to the reliability or the performance of such Third Party Sites.

WEBSITE USE RULES AND RESTRICTIONS

Our Website may only be used for lawful purposes. The Company specifically prohibits any use of our Website, and all users agree not to use our Website, for any of the following:

Submitting any incomplete, false or inaccurate information or information which is not your own accurate information (e.g. impersonating or pretending to be anyone else but you, including, without limitation, by creating false accounts of any person or entity, falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity or using someone else’s identification without their consent);

Deleting or revising any material posted by us or any other person or entity;

If you have a password allowing access to a non-public area of our Website, disclosing to or sharing your password with any third parties or using your password for any unauthorized purpose;

Harming minors in any way;

Transmitting by any means any software, virus, malware, program, code, file or other material intended to interrupt, disrupt, alter, destroy or limit any part of the Website or attempting to access, alter or decompile the Website or an underlying program, code or software of the Website, or using any robot, spider, script or any manual or automated application or means to extract, download, index, create multiple accounts, mine, scrape, reproduce or circumvent the presentation, operation, or intended use of any feature, function or part of the Website;

Aggregating, copying, framing, downloading, distributing, transmitting, uploading, transferring content from the Website or the personal information of others from the Website or duplicating in any manner any of the materials or information available from our Website; or

REGISTRATION AND PASSWORDS

When or if you register an account with us, you may be required to provide some of your personal information. By using the Website and providing us with your personal information, you also accept our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by this reference and other policies that we may, from time to time, adopt. You are responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, including but not limited to, maintaining the confidentiality of your password and user name and activities that occur under such password and username. We reserve the right to cancel your account at any time for any reason without prior notice to you. You acknowledge and agree that if your account is cancelled (in our sole discretion) your account data may no longer be accessible to you. Without limiting the Privacy Policy or these Terms, you agree that we may store and use your registration information that you provide for use in maintaining your account.

ACCURACY OF CONTENT AND PRICING INFORMATION

Because prices, product descriptions and availability can change quickly, the Company does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information provided on the Website. Also, the Company may make changes to the information contained on the Website, including to the products and prices described, at any time, without prior notice to you (including after you have submitted your order). Information at the Website is periodically updated, but may not be current or complete at the moment you visit the Website and may contain errors or inaccuracies. In no event shall the Company, its parent company and affiliates, or its service or product providers be liable to you in any manner whatsoever for any decision made by you, or for any act or failure to act by you, in reliance upon information provided at the Website.

Items in your shopping cart or “basket” will reflect the most recent price displayed on the item's product detail page. Prices are frequently updated to adjust for different sales, limited pricing, and other discounting. Therefore, prices on the product detail page and in your cart may change after such updates to reflect the current prices. Placing items in your cart does not reserve the current prices shown at that time, and prices are reserved only by placing an order. From time to time, despite our efforts, certain items in our catalog may be mispriced. Please note that such errors or inaccuracies may be related to product descriptions, territorial currencies, pricing and availability.

LIMITED QUANTITIES

Some products may be limited to stock on hand and are offered on a first come, first served basis.

INDEMNIFICATION

You will indemnify, release and hold harmless us, our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates and all agents and employees thereof and any party acting on our behalf, from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (collectively, “Claims”) arising out of (i) your use of the Website or any product you may receive or purchase from the Website; (ii) any breach of these Terms by you; or (iii) any violation of any laws, regulations or the rights of any third party by you in connection with your use of the Website.
