​

### 7\. Privacy and Personal Information

You acknowledge that you have read and agree to all of the terms and conditions of Wally’s Privacy Policy, which is located at [**www.wally.me/privacy**](http://www.wally.me/privacy), and that you agree to the incorporation of the Privacy Policy into these Terms & Conditions.

​

### 8\. Confidentiality and Transmissions over the Internet

The transmission of data or information (including communications by e-mail) over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks is inherently not secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception, or alteration while in transit. Accordingly, Wally does not assume any liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks, including without limitation transmissions involving the exchange of e-mail with Wally containing your personal information. While Wally shall take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to Wally and shall treat such information in accordance with Wally’s Privacy Policy, in no event will the information you provide to Wally be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations to you on Wally’s part, or result in any liability to you on Wally’s part in the event that such information is inadvertently released by Wally or accessed by third parties without Wally’s consent.

​

### 9\. Proprietary Rights

“Wally”, “wally.me”, the Wally logo, and other identifying marks of Wally are and shall remain the trade-marks and trade names and exclusive property of Wally, and any unauthorized use of these marks is unlawful. Other trade-marks on the Services are the property of their respective owners. All content in the Services, including without limitation all programs, compiled binaries, interface layout, interface text, documentation, and graphics, is the copyrighted property of Wally and is protected by international copyright law. The Information And Content may be used by you only for your personal, non-commercial use. Any rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Wally.

​

### 10\. Indemnification by User

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Wally and Wally’s affiliates, business partners, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any loss, liability, claim, action, suit, demand, damage, or expense (including reasonable legal fees, costs of investigation and court costs) asserted by any third party relating in any way to, or in respect of, your use of the Services, any third party applications, software, information, content, and/or materials you post or share on or through the Services, or breach of these Terms & Conditions. Wally reserves the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, which shall not excuse your indemnity obligations.

​

### 11\. Bank Linking

In order to provide bank linking capabilities, allowing you to connect your bank account to Wally for automatic transaction updates, Wally may work with one or more third party financial service technology providers to access and retrieve your Account Information. Depending on the financial institution, we use Plaid or Salt Edge. By using the Service, you indicate that you have read and agree with the Plaid [Terms of Service](https://plaid.com/legal/) and [Privacy Policy](https://plaid.com/legal/#privacy-statement), and the Salt Edge [Terms of Service](https://www.saltedge.com/pages/dashboard_terms_of_service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.saltedge.com/pages/dashboard_privacy_policy).

You understand and agree that the Service is not sponsored or endorsed by any third parties accessible through the Service. Wally is not responsible for any errors or omissions or third party service related issues with respect to the account or the accuracy of said information retrieved or obtained from these third parties.

​

### 12\. Third Party Websites, Content and Products and Services

Any hypertext links or pointers to third party web sites and references to products and services offered by third parties are provided to you for convenience only and do not constitute an endorsement or approval by Wally of: (I) the organisations that operate such websites; (II) the information, content, privacy policies or other terms of use on such websites; or (III) such third party products and services.

As Wally has no control or responsibility over, and does not investigate, monitor, or check for accuracy third party web sites or information and/or content maintained by other organisations, or for products and services offered by third parties, and Wally does not assume any liability for your use of any of the foregoing. If you decide to exit the Services and access third party web sites, you acknowledge and agree that you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that these Terms & Conditions no longer govern.

​

### 13\. Unlawful Activity

Wally reserves the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of these Terms & Conditions and to take any action Wally deems appropriate, including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties, and disclosing any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profiles, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses, and traffic information.

​

Wally may decline to provide access to the Services to any users that are subject to, or that are located in countries that are subject to, any national or international sanctions programs.

​

### 14\. General

These Terms & Conditions incorporate by reference all notices and disclaimers contained in the Services, including but not limited to the Privacy Policy and, except for any agreements with Wally that expressly reference these Terms & Conditions, constitute the entire agreement between you and Wally with respect to access to, and use of, the Services. Except as specifically set forth herein, these Terms & Conditions supersede any prior agreements, including prior oral and/or written statements or representations not contained herein, between you and Wally relating to the Services. This agreement is not intended to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between you and Wally.

​

If any provision of these Terms & Conditions is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable statute or rule of law, the provision shall be deemed omitted to the extent that it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable. In such a case, the remaining provisions of these Terms & Conditions shall be construed in a manner as to give greatest effect to the original intention of the parties hereto. Wally’s failure to insist upon, or enforce, strict performance of any right or provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not constitute or be construed or deemed to be a waiver of such right or provision in the future or a waiver of any other right or provision under these Terms & Conditions. You agree that these Terms & Conditions, Wally’s Privacy Policy and other notices posted through the Services have been drawn up in English. Although translations in other languages of any of the foregoing documents may be available, such translations may not be up to date or complete. Accordingly, you agree that in the event of any conflict between the English language version of the foregoing documents and any other translations thereto, the English language version of such documents shall govern.

​

These Terms & Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, without regard to conflict of laws provisions thereto. All rights and remedies, whether conferred by this agreement, by any other instrument or by law, shall be cumulative, and may be exercised singly or concurrently. The parties hereby irrevocably agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom.

​

### 15\. Force Majeure

In addition to applicable disclaimers stated above, Wally’s performance under these Terms & Conditions shall be excused in the event of interruption and/or delay due to, or resulting from, causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, acts of any government, war or other hostility, civil disorder, the elements, fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, embargo, acts of terrorism, power failure, equipment failure, industrial or labour disputes or controversies, acts of any third party data provider(s) or other third party information provider(s), third party software, or communication method interruptions.
