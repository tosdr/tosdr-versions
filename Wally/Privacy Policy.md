Transparency

This section will explain exactly where your data goes, and who sees what. Our goal is to be clear about how your information is used, so that you have a full understanding of what’s happening with your data.

Who can see my data?

Firstly, we are not in the business of selling your Wally information to advertisers.

Secondly, all data is run through a process with the aim of aggregating and anonymizing it automatically. Data that has been anonymized prevents your personally identifiable details from being connected with the data.

1\. Wally Community

What?We’ll use aggregated data about age group, city, and income bracket to give you insights, for example: “You spend 20% more on dining out than people like you.”Why do we do it?

To give you back your data in a way that gives meaningful contextualization and benchmarks for your financial behavior.

2\. Research Partners

What do we do?Our academic advisors (researchers at Harvard University) will look at aggregated data to determine patterns in spending and savings behavior.Why do we do it?

We want to find actionable insights to give back to you.

For example, if research shows that Wisconsin residents overspend on water bills in the summer, Wally will tell you to be wary when the weather gets warmer.

Information

Information (yes, it’s still aggregated and anonymized) may be shared with trusted third-party analytics providers, and service providers, who will help us optimize the Wally experience.

Who can’t see it

1. Wally employees

2. Advertisers, marketers
3. Banks/ Institutions selling financial products (i.e. credit cards, loans)
4. The NSA
