Terms of Service
===================

### GENERAL

HideIPVPN.com (hereafter referenced as HideIPVPN) provides VPN services under the name of HideIPVPN.com, registered under Server Management LLC. As a provider of internet services, HideIPVPN offers its clients, and their customers and users, the means to disseminate public, private, commercial, and non-commercial information.

HideIPVPN respects the fact that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information. However, when there are competing interests at issue, HideIPVPN reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, HideIPVPN has developed these Terms Of Service, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement. These terms are intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations when utilizing HideIPVPN’s services.

These terms will be revised from time to time. A customer’s use of HideIPVPN’s services after changes to these terms are posted on HideIPVPN.com web sites will constitute the customer’s acceptance of any new or additional terms.

HideIPVPN does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information its clients may create. By placing information on the Internet, clients have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech. Also, because the information they place on HideIPVPN’s network may be carried to a large number of people, including both clients and non-clients of HideIPVPN, clients’ postings to the Internet may affect other clients and may harm HideIPVPN’s goodwill, business reputation, and operations.

### PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

HideIPVPN prohibits the use of any of its services in any of the following ways:

1. **P2P and Torrents** on (US, UK, CA, PL, FR and SG servers)

2\. Connect to VPN or Proxy to more than **5 servers** at the same time.

3\. Share your VPN/SmartDNS account details, SmartDNS key as well as access to your “Client area” on HideIPVPN website. You may install and use both our services on all devices in your household as long as you will not breach point above.

4\. Spamming

5\. Intellectual Property Violations

6\. Defamatory or Abusive Language

7\. Forging of Headers

8\. Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks

9\. Background Running Programs

10\. Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities

11\. Facilitating a Violation of this TOS

12\. Export Control Violations

13\. Spamming Usenet Groups or Message Boards

14\. Any Other Illegal Activities

It is HideIPVPN’s policy to terminate the privileges of customers who commit repeat violations of HideIPVPN policy and service agreements.

To avoid any misunderstandings of what is considered a prohibited activity, HideIPVPN offers a brief explanation of previously stated prohibited activities.

**Spamming** is the sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages over the Internet. It is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward HideIPVPN, but also because it can overload HideIPVPN’s network and disrupt service to HideIPVPN clients. Also, maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited.

**Intellectual Property Violations** is the engaging in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, software piracy, and patents held by individuals, corporations, or other entities. Also, engaging in activity that violates privacy, publicity, or other personal rights of others. HideIPVPN is required by law to remove or block access to customer content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement laws.

**Defamatory or Abusive Language** refers to the use of HideIPVPN’s network as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language.

**Forging of Headers** refers to the forging or misrepresenting of message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message.

**Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks** is accessing illegally or without authorization computers, accounts, or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individual’s system (often known as “hacking”). This violation also includes any activity that might be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e. port scan, stealth scan, or other information gathering activity).

**Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities** refers to the distributing of information regarding the creation of and sending of internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mailbombing, or denial of service attacks. Also, it includes any activities that disrupt the use of or interfere with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected network, system, service, or equipment.

**Facilitating a Violation of this TOS** refers to advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available any software, program, product, or service that is designed to violate this TOS, which includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, flooding, mailbombing, denial of service attacks, and piracy of software.

**Export Control Violations** refers to exporting encryption software, over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States.

**Other Illegal Activities** refers to engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes. Other examples are fraudulently charging credit cards and pirating software.

**Other Activities** refer to any activity, including lawful ones, that HideIPVPN determines to be harmful to its clients, operations, reputation, goodwill, or customer relations.

The responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just described rests primarily with the client. HideIPVPN will not, in normal practice, monitor the communications of its clients to ensure that they comply with HideIPVPN policy or applicable law. When HideIPVPN becomes aware of harmful activities, however, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or other actions HideIPVPN deems appropriate.

**No Class Actions.** All claims between the parties will be litigated individually and You will not consolidate or seek class treatment for any claim with respect to the Services.

HideIPVPN is also concerned with the privacy of on-line communications and web sites. In general, the Internet is neither more nor less secure than other means of communication, including mail, facsimile, and voice telephone service, all of which can be intercepted and otherwise compromised. As a matter of prudence, however, HideIPVPN urges its clients to assume that all of their on-line communications are insecure. HideIPVPN cannot take any responsibility for the security of information transmitted HideIPVPN’s facilities.

HideIPVPN keeps a **no-logs policy**, this means that activity whilst using VPN is not being stored nor shared in any form. Only data stored is client’s full name and billing activity. We do not store IP addresses, browsing history , traffic destination or DNS queries. HideIPVPN cannot be obligated to provide data that do not exist due to our log policy.

HideIPVPN may disclose information, including but not limited to, information concerning a client, in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation, or governmental request. HideIPVPN assumes no obligation to inform the client that client information has been provided and in some cases may be prohibited by law from giving such notice. Finally, HideIPVPN may disclose client information where necessary to protect HideIPVPN and others from harm or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of the system.

_HideIPVPN may request proofs of your identity (card ID, driver license, etc.) if the order looks suspicious or if it is made from a high risk country. The refuse to send the required documents will result in termination of your Account, without any refund of amounts previously paid for this service._
