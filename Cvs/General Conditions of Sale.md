Returning nonprescription items in store or online
--------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to limit or refuse any refund or exchange. All returns or exchanges are subject to a third-party verification process.

**Return in Store**  
Most new, unopened items purchased from CVS Pharmacy or CVS.com® can be returned to any CVS Pharmacy store within 60 days of purchase for exchange or refund. A full copy of our return policy including restrictions and requirements is available at CVS.com®/ReturnPolicy.

* Valid photo ID may be required for any return or exchange.
* Items that are opened or damaged, missing a receipt, or do not pass our third-party verification process may be denied a refund or exchange.
* Items returned with the original receipt may receive a refund or store credit in the amount of the original purchase price. If your purchase was made with a credit card or debit/cash card, your refund will be made to that card.
* Items returned without a receipt may be exchanged for the same item or refunded as store credit. A refund for such a return may be limited to the lowest advertised price in the 60-day period prior to the return. Returns lacking proof of purchase also may be limited or denied.
