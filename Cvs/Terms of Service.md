About our Health Content
------------------------

Our health content describes general principles of health care that should not in any event be construed as specific instructions for individual patients. This material is not intended as a guide to self-medication or as a substitute for proper medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is for reference only and should not be used to determine treatment for specific medical conditions--only a health care provider can do that. The Service and its health related information and resources are not intended and must not be taken as the rendering of medical, nursing, or professional health care advice or services, or the practice of medicine, nursing, or professional health care in any jurisdiction. You should discuss the information provided with a physician, pharmacist, nurse, or other licensed health care professional. You should also check product information (including package inserts) regarding dosage, precautions, warnings, interactions, and contraindications before administering or using any device, drug, herb, vitamin, or supplement discussed on the Service.

You understand and agree that neither CVS nor its suppliers or vendors are responsible for any claim, loss, or damage directly or indirectly resulting from your use of the Service or the information resources contained on or accessible through the Service.

Proper treatment of health conditions depends upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, your medical history, diet, lifestyle, and medication regimen. Your health care provider can best assess and address your individual health care needs. You should consult with your health care provider before starting a new diet, fitness, or supplement regimen. **IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL CRISIS, PLEASE CALL 911 OR CONTACT YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY.**

Information and statements about dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease or health condition. CVS does not endorse manufacturers' or others' claims about the efficacy of these products. We specifically disclaim any guarantee or warranty, express or implied, with respect to any products or services sold, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. No information conveyed by CVS either orally or in writing shall create such a warranty.

Symptom checker services that may be available at care.cvs.com are provided by Clearstep Inc., an independent third party not owned or operated by CVS. Symptom checker services provide general information for educational purposes only. All educational information, including over-the-counter medicine information, is derived from Clearstep Clinical Content. Symptom checker services do not provide, and are not a substitute for, medical advice, judgement, diagnosis, or treatment from your health care provider. Symptom checker services are not a medical device and are not intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate any disease or condition. They are not, and cannot be, error-free.

Provider finder services that may be available at care.cvs.com for non-CVS options are based on other third-party resources not owned or operated by CVS. Information regarding non-CVS options concerns health care providers who are not employees or agents of CVS or any CVS subsidiary or affiliate. CVS is not responsible for and disclaims all liability for the services of non-CVS health care provider options. Provider finder services are not a referral service. The information available is not a recommendation, endorsement, or guarantee by CVS of any specific health care provider or any test, product, or procedure a health care provider may offer. CVS does not offer advice regarding the quality or suitability of any particular health care provider for any specific condition or treatment. CVS does not guarantee that any health care provider is seeing new patients, that you are eligible to receive services from any health care provider, or that services from any health care provider are covered by your health plan.

You are strictly prohibited from communicating on or through the Service (including in connection with any Materials) any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Service, or parts of the Service, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that it is in violation of any applicable law or it is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another user or other third party partners, affiliates, sponsors, providers, licensors, or merchants.

You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information in connection with the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain and promptly update this account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. If you provide any information that is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is fraudulent, untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or not current, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without notice and refuse any and all current and future use of the Service. Because any termination of your access to the Service may be effected without prior notice, you acknowledge and agree that we may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and bar any further access to such files or the Service. Furthermore, you agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to your account or the Service.

You may be asked to supply a user ID and password and other information to register to use all or part of the Service. We may refuse to grant you a user ID that impersonates someone else, is or may be illegal, is or may be protected by trademark or other proprietary rights law, is vulgar or otherwise offensive, or may cause confusion, as determined by us in our sole discretion. For security reasons, user IDs and passwords must be non-obvious, hard-to-guess, confidential and changed on a regular basis, and you must log out at the end of each session. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user ID and password and are fully responsible for all activities (including purchases, as applicable) that occur in connection with your user ID or password such that, for all purposes under this Agreement, any activities in connection with your user ID or password will be deemed to be your activities. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of either your user ID or password or any other breach of security. You further agree that you will not permit others, including those whose accounts have been terminated, to access the Service using your user ID or password. All user IDs and passwords remain the property of CVS, and may be cancelled or suspended at any time by CVS without any prior notice or any liability to you or any other person. CVS is not under any obligation to verify the actual identity or authority of the user of any user ID or password. If CVS, in its sole discretion, considers a password to be insecure, then CVS may cancel the password.

If you give us the personal information of others in connection with the Service, you represent that you have the right to do so. And you permit us to use the information in accordance with the Privacy Policy. You give us consent to share your information with your social media platform when you connect your Service account and social media account or by contacting us by social media.

If you are a member of a prescription drug plan (“Plan”) managed by CVS Caremark and have filled prescriptions with CVS in the past, you may use cvs.com to access your Plan information instead of having to log in separately through [**www.caremark.com**](http://www.caremark.com/) Plan information is maintained separately by CVS Caremark on behalf of Plans for their Plan members.

When participating in sweepstakes or contests offered through the Service, you are urged to review the official rules and regulations governing those promotions. All Materials submitted as part of a contest will be governed by contest rules published with the contest.

Text Messaging Terms and Conditions
-----------------------------------

CVS Pharmacy, Inc. or one or more of its affiliates (CVS) offers access to pharmacy, healthcare service, and loyalty program messages via recurring SMS (Short Message Service) and MMS (Multimedia Message Service) text alerts. Enrollment in text alerts requires a patient or customer to provide his or her own mobile phone number with an area code within the 50 United States or the District of Columbia. By enrolling to receive messages from one of the CVS text alert programs, you agree to these terms and conditions, which become effective upon your enrollment. You may be asked to verify your mobile phone number before the service will start. This requires responding to a text alert sent to your mobile phone confirming your enrollment in this Service.

You acknowledge that text alerts will be sent to the mobile phone number you provide to CVS. Such alerts may include limited personal information about your prescriptions or healthcare services, and whoever has access to the mobile phone or carrier account will also be able to see this information. Once you enroll, the frequency of text alerts we send to you will vary. You will typically receive text alerts when we have information for you about your prescriptions, other healthcare services, or the ExtraCare® program, as applicable. CVS does not impose a separate charge for text alerts; however, your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply depending on the terms and conditions of your mobile phone contract. You are solely responsible for all message and data charges that you incur. Please contact your mobile service provider about such charges.

The CVS text alert programs are offered on an "as is" basis and: (1) may not be available in all areas at all times; and (2) may not continue to work in the event of product, software, coverage or other service changes made by your wireless carrier. CVS may change or discontinue any of its text alert programs without notice or liability to you. CVS and its related companies and each of their respective officers, directors and employees are not responsible and shall not be liable for any losses or injuries of any kind resulting, directly or indirectly, from any CVS text alert program or from technical failures or delays of any kind. CVS reserves the right to cease delivery of text alerts to any person at anytime in its sole discretion. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

Third Party Resources
---------------------

The Service may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party sites, services, products, information, content, materials, merchandise, functionality and/or other resources ("Third Party Resources"). These links and access are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such Third Party Resources and, therefore, we are not responsible for such Third Party Resources, or any content posted on or made available by such Third Party Resources. Be aware that CVS does not control, makes no guarantees about, and disclaims any express or implied representations or warranties about such Third Party Resources, including without limitation the security of any Materials, or the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose of the information or the resources contained on or made available by such Third Party Resources or any other Internet sites. We reserve the right to terminate such links or such access at any time. The fact that we offer such links or access should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of such Third Party Resources, or any content made available thereby. Because some Third Party Resources employ automated search results or otherwise link you to Third Party Resources containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, we cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or made available by Third Party Resources, including the weekly circular ads available online, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such Third Party Resources. Your use of any Third Party Resources is subject to the Third Party's terms, conditions and policies applicable to such products, services or materials (such as Terms of Service or Privacy Policies of the providers of such products, services or materials). CVS is not responsible for the privacy and security of any information you share with that Third Party, including your credit card or payment information. For example, our photo processing services are provided by Snapfish (or another Third Party) and some delivery services are provided by a Third Party. When you elect to receive these services from a Third Party, you agree to hold that Third Party responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information.

* * *

Governing Law
-------------

This Agreement, your use of the Service, all transactions through the Service, and all related matters, regardless of your location, are governed solely by, and construed solely in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws which would lead to the application of any other laws

* * *

Dispute Resolution
------------------

**EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND CVS (OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS), WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED IN FINAL, BINDING, INDVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR A JURY. YOU AND CVS AGREE THAT CVS AND YOU EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY AND THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ("FAA") AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW, NOT STATE LAW, GOVERN THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION.  YOU AND CVS ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ACTIONS, CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS, AND MASS ACTIONS, WHETHER IN COURT OR ARBITRATION, ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AND CVS AGREE TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR MASS ACTION.**

FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS YOU OR CVS HAVE, THE PARTY PURSUING THE DISPUTE OR CLAIM MUST FIRST GIVE THE OTHER PARTY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE OR CLAIM BY SENDING AN INDIVIDUAL, WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE CLAIM THAT DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE INDIVIDUAL DAMAGES THAT THE PARTY CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFERED (THE “DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION”). YOU MUST SEND YOUR DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION TO CVS’S REGISTERED AGENT AT THIS ADDRESS:

CVS PHARMACY, INC.  
C/O CT CORPORATION SYSTEM  
450 VETERANS MEMORIAL PARKWAY, SUITE 7A  
EAST PROVIDENCE, RI 02914

You and CVS each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. Each party agrees that it may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and CVS are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after receipt of the demand for arbitration and the parties have made a good faith effort to resolve their claims directly during that time. If you or CVS are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days despite those good faith efforts, then either you or CVS may start an arbitration or small claims court proceeding. You and CVS agree that any dispute as to whether these conditions precedent have been satisfied will be decided in court and not by the arbitrator. Either you or CVS may elect to have an arbitration proceeding initiated by the other party adjudicated in small claims court by giving written notice of that election to the other party.

Arbitration shall be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, including its Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness for Consumer and Employment/Workplace Arbitrations, and its Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (the “NAM Rules”).  The NAM Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from NAM at [https://www.namadr.com/](https://www.namadr.com/). If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, you and we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint a different arbitration administrator but will not decide arbitrability or any other aspect of the parties’ dispute (except as outlined above or if either party files a small claims court matter). In the case of in person proceedings, the proceedings should be conducted at a location that is reasonably convenient to you with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination should be made by the arbitrator. Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by NAM’s schedule of “Fees for Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator decides that any claim asserted in the arbitration demand is frivolous, the arbitrator may award the defending party any attorney’s fees and any filing, administration, and arbitrator fees incurred. The arbitrator may award any individual relief a court of law could, including temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief on an individual basis.

If a court or arbitrator finds in any action between you and us that any part of this Dispute Resolution provision is unenforceable with respect to any claim, then the arbitration agreement and class action waiver will not apply to that claim, but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or CVS may assert in that or any other action. If any provision of this Dispute Resolution provision is found unenforceable, the other parts of it shall continue to apply. These Terms, all transactions related to CVS, and all related matters are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, the laws of New York, without regard to any conflict of laws rules.

Copyright Infringement Claims: Notice and Take-Down Procedures
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Service infringe your rights under U.S. copyright law, you (or your agent) may send to CVS a written notice by mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that CVS remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to CVS a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing and meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details), which, with respect to notices of infringement, currently include, among other requirements, the following:

1. Sufficient information identifying the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.
2. Sufficient information identifying the allegedly infringing material(s) and the location of such material(s) in order to permit CVS to locate such material(s).
3. A statement from the owner (or the owner's authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed that such owner or authorized representative has a good faith belief that the allegedly infringing materials are used in a manner not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
4. Contact information for the complaining party, including a mailing address, a telephone number and, if available, an email address.
5. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
6. A signature or the electronic equivalent from the owner (or the owner's authorized representative) of the copyrighted work(s) believed to be infringed.

Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to CVS's DMCA agent as follows:

DMCA Agent, Legal Department

Mail: CVS/pharmacy, One CVS Drive, Woonsocket, R.I. 02895 Mail Code 1160  
Email: [**DMCA@cvshealth.com**](mailto:DMCA@cvshealth.com)

If alerted to allegedly infringing, defamatory, damaging, illegal, or offensive content, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of such content from the Service.

We control the Service from our corporate offices within the United States of America, and the Service is not intended to subject CVS to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. By accessing and using the Service you agree that such access and use is subject to the terms, conditions, and policies of this Agreement as well as applicable laws. Our failure to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as an implicit waiver of any provision or right.

If any part of this Agreement is ruled to be unenforceable, then such part shall be severed, with the remainder of the Agreement remaining in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CVS governing your use of the Service. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction.

We hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available from [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison\_of\_content-control\_software\_and\_providers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_content-control_software_and_providers).

If you have a question or complaint regarding the Service, please see [**here**](https://www.cvs.com/help/help_contact_us.jsp) for information on how to contact us, or contact us as follows:

CVS Health Corporation  
1 CVS Drive  
Woonsocket, R.I. 02895  
Telephone: [**(888) 607-4287**](tel:1-888-607-4287 "call on 1-888-607-4287")

California residents may reach the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at [**(916) 445-1254**](tel:1-916-445-1254 "call on 1-916-445-1254") or [**(800) 952-5210**](tel:1-800-952-5210 "call on 1-800-952-5210").

The Service may contain or make available forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, CVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries, including CVS (collectively, "CVS Group"), and its and their representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in CVS Health Corporation's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in the CVS Group's reports to stockholders, press releases, webcasts, conference calls, meetings and other communications. Generally, the inclusion of the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "project," "anticipate," "will," "should" and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward-looking statements. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS Health Corporation or any subsidiary, events or developments that the CVS Group expects or anticipates will occur in the future, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. The CVS Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in CVS Health Corporation's SEC filings, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of CVS Health Corporation's current Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There can be no assurance that CVS Health Corporation has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to CVS Health Corporation or that it currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the CVS Group. Should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have a material adverse effect on the CVS Group's business, financial condition and results of operations. For these reasons, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the CVS Group's forward-looking statements.
