3\. Your Privacy Choices and Rights
-----------------------------------

You have the ability to make certain choices about how we use your Personal Information, as follows:

### _a) Unsubscribing from our Marketing and Promotional Communications_

From time to time, we may send you marketing and promotional communications, including special offers from us or our partners. If you no longer wish to receive promotional and marketing emails from us, you may opt out of such communications at any time by following the opt-out instructions included in any promotional or marketing email you receive from us.

### _b) Privacy Rights and Requests_

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may have certain rights in relation to your Personal Information, including:

* Right to Know: You may have the right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we disclose Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you. Please note that we may not be required to respond to your requests “to know” or access specific pieces of Personal Information more than twice in any 12-month period.
* Right to Request Specific List of Third Parties: You may have the right to request a list of the specific third parties with whom we have shared or sold your Personal Information.
* Right to Data Portability:You may have the right to access your information in a portable format.
* Right to Delete: You may have the right to request that we delete Personal Information that we have collected from or about you, subject to certain exceptions.
* Right to Correct: You may have the right to correct inaccurate Personal Information that we may maintain about you, subject to appropriate verification.
* Right to Opt Out of Certain Types of Personal Information Uses and Disclosures: We use and disclose to third parties Personal Information for analytics and advertising purposes. Accordingly, you may have the right to opt out of the “sale” or "sharing” of your Personal Information, or the use and disclosure of your Personal Information for “targeted advertising” (as these terms are defined under applicable law).

Please note that, where permitted under applicable law, we may decline a request (other than for opt outs) if we are unable to verify your identity (or an agent’s authority to make the request) and confirm the Personal Information we maintain relates to you.

If you are interested in exercising one or more of the rights outlined above except for the Right to Opt Out [(see Section 3(d) below)](#sec3d), please click [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/1885551f-146f-4594-ae8d-5966aac0551f/1eb23c44-cba9-45c6-bd0f-4f89053910f4?formField136=web) or call us at [1-800-SHOP-CVS (1-800-746-7287)](tel:1-800-746-7287 "call on 1-800-746-7287"). We may take steps to verify your identity before responding to your request by asking you a series of questions about you or your previous interactions with us. Submitting a privacy rights request does not require you to create an account with us.

We will not discriminate against you if you decide to exercise your privacy rights.

### _c) Agent Requests_

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may submit a request related to your Personal Information.

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may authorize someone to make a privacy rights request on your behalf (an authorized agent). Authorized agents will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf. CVS retains the right to request confirmation directly from you confirming that the agent is authorized to make such a request, or to request additional information to confirm the agent’s identity.

### _d) Opt-Out Requests_

You may request to opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information, or of targeted advertising, at any time by clicking the “Your Privacy Choices” link [here](https://www.cvs.com/account/compliance/do-not-sell) or at the bottom of our Services’ homepages.

Submitting an opt-out request does not require you to create an account with us.

Alternatively, you can use certain preference signals to opt out automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including CVS. If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal, such as Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will endeavor to recognize and treat the signal as a valid request to opt out. If you use different browsers or browser profiles, you may need to enable the signal on each browser or profile if we’re unable to associate your preference signal with you.

If you are not logged in on the Services, you may need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices, as each opt out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out if we do not recognize who you are. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, this also may mean that the opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again.

In addition, you may opt out of the collection and use of your Personal Information for ad targeting by Google Ad Manager on the Site and the CVS App. You can opt out of this ad targeting powered by Google Ad Manager [here](https://www.cvs.com/shop/compliance-optout).

Further, you may be able to opt out of receiving certain targeted or interest-based advertisements using the browser opt-out tools and consumer choice mechanisms provided by advertising industry self-regulatory groups by following the links below:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI): [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1)
* Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA): [https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control%20)

You also can control whether you see interest-based advertisements on your mobile device(s) in the following ways:

* Your device operating system may provide mechanisms that allow you to opt in or opt out of the use of information about your use of mobile apps to deliver interest-based advertising to your mobile device. For more information, consult your device settings.
* The DAA offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on mobile devices for interest-based advertising. To exercise your choices with respect to participating companies, please download the AppChoices tool at [www.aboutads.info/appchoices.](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices)

Even if you choose to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, you may still receive advertising, but the advertisements may be less relevant.

Some of our partners may provide you with additional choices with respect to interest-based advertising. For example, certain social media platforms allow you to control your advertising preferences directly through their services. Please review the privacy policies of the third-party services you use for more information.

### _e) Right to Appeal_

Depending on your U.S. state of residence, you may have the right to appeal a decision we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. To appeal a decision, please contact us at [ConsumerPrivacy@CVSHealth.com](mailto:ConsumerPrivacy@CVSHealth.com).

### _f) Notice of Financial Incentive_

We offer financial incentives to promote our products and services. These include:

* ExtraCare: As further described below, in exchange for your enrollment in our ExtraCare program, we may offer you special pricing or service differences, including those you become eligible for when you opt in to earn rewards at the pharmacy or enroll in ExtraCare Plus™, which may be considered “financial incentive” programs under applicable state laws.
* ExtraCare Plus: If you join our ExtraCare Plus membership, we may offer additional ExtraBucks Rewards® and members-only rewards by tracking additional data elements. As an ExtraCare Plus member, you may have the opportunity to join a third-party partners’ program at a discount. If you choose to join a third-party partners’ program through your ExtraCare Plus membership, you may receive additional ExtraBucks Rewards and members-only rewards in exchange for access and use of your information you provide to our partners as part of these third-party partners’ programs.

We may ask you to provide Personal Information in connection with these promotions, including the following Personal Information: identifiers, including contact information, date of birth, commercial information, purchase history, and information concerning your health. Because these promotions involve the collection of Personal Information, they may be interpreted as “financial incentive” programs under California law or “bona fide loyalty programs” under Colorado law. We use this information for the purposes described in our [Notice at Collection of Personal Information](https://www.cvs.com/retail/help/ca_notice_collection), including for targeted advertising. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in our Notice at Collection of Personal Information, including data analytics providers, advertising technology vendors, and social media platforms.

Participation in any financial incentive is optional. To enroll, please click [here](https://www.cvs.com/extracare/home/). You may withdraw from the program at any time by signing into your account and submitting your request [here](https://www.cvs.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fcarepass%2FcancelSubscription), or by submitting a request to delete your Personal Information [here.](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/1885551f-146f-4594-ae8d-5966aac0551f/1eb23c44-cba9-45c6-bd0f-4f89053910f4?formField136=web) To stop receiving our emailed coupons or discounts, you may unsubscribe by clicking the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any such email. If you ask us to delete your Personal Information, we will not be able to provide you with access to these programs.

The value of any financial incentive we offer is reasonably related to the value of any Personal Information you provide to us. We estimate the value of your Personal Information by considering, without limitation, the expenses we incur from collecting your Personal Information and/or providing the financial incentive to you, the revenue generated by your use of the financial incentive, and any improvements we can make to our products and services based on aggregating information obtained through the financial incentive program.

We may provide additional terms that apply to a particular financial incentive. If applicable, those terms will be presented to you at sign up.
