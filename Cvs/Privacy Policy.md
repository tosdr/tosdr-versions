    ---------------------------------
    
    The Services may contain links to, or make available, third-party websites, services, features or other resources not run by us or on our behalf (the “Third-Party Services.”) We make these Third-Party Services available as a convenience to you and are not affiliated with, endorsing or sponsoring the Third-Party Services.
    
      
    
    Any information you give to such third parties is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of the information you give to Third-Party Services or how they handle your information. We also are not responsible for the information collection, use, sharing or security practices of Third-Party Services.

If you engage with the Commercial Services using a social media platform your friends and connections and others who use our Commercial Services may also see it, as might your social media account provider. The social media provider’s privacy policy governs the use of the information you share on or through the social media platform.
    
      
    
7. Security
    --------
    
    We use reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards. Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security. You should take steps to ensure your personal information is protected like using passwords that would be difficult to guess, not using the same password for multiple accounts and periodically changing your password.
    
      
    
8. Cookies and other technologies
    ------------------------------
    
    What are cookies? Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. These are usually small text files. They help us personalize content for you on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons. You can set your browser to accept or reject cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are in the Help section of most browsers.
    
      
    
    How we use cookies. Like many other websites and online services, we collect traffic and usage patterns. We use cookies, Web server logs and similar technologies to do this.
    
      
    
    We use this information for various purposes:
    
      
    
    * To ensure that the Online Services function properly
    * To help with navigation (or how you find your way around the site)
    * To personalize your experience
    * To understand use of the Online Services
    * To diagnose problems
    * To measure the success of our marketing campaigns and targeted ads
    * To otherwise administer the Online Services
    
      
    
    We also use cookies to collect and receive certain information about a website user, such as the type of web browser used, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device platform, device version, and/or other device characteristics including your choice of settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Global Positioning System ("GPS"), CPU ID and type, build, model, manufacturer, operating system version, screen size, screen resolution, mobile network status, device locale, and carrier ID. We review our web server logs and our customers’ use of our site. This helps us to gather statistics on how many people are using our site and why.
    
      
    
    Internet providers assign your device an IP address number. We may identify and log your IP address automatically in our Web server log files when you use our Online Services. We may also collect the time of your visit and the pages you look at. We use IP addresses to do things like gauge usage levels of the Online Services, help find server problems, and administer the Commercial Services.
    
      
    
    CVS uses tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, pixels, tags) to collect and record your activities and movements across our websites throughout your browsing session, including device information, page hits, mouse movements, scrolling, typing, out-of-the-box errors and events, and API calls (“Session Data”). We use this information to (1) remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the services, (3) perform analytics, (4) tailor the site and services around your preferences; (5) provide contextual and personalized advertisements; (6) measure the usability of the services and the effectiveness of our communications; and (7) improve our products, services, and your experience. Such tracking may also include recorded sessions, which we may play back for these purposes. We may share Session Data with our vendors and third party partners (which may change over time) for these purposes. CVS respects your privacy and offers you the choice to allow or reject some types of tracking technologies. Please note your experience on the site and services available to you may be impacted based on your choices.
    
      
    
9. Interest-based advertising
    --------------------------
    
    Like many companies, CVS participates in interest-based advertising. We may use or partner with third-party companies, including social media and third-party advertising companies tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online. Doing so helps us to measure services and display targeted ads when you access and use the Online Services.
    
      
    
    These are ads about goods and services we feel may interest you based on your access to and your use of our Commercial Services and other online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These third parties may also use pixel tags, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect or receive information about your online activities over time and across our website and elsewhere on the Internet.
    
      
    
    We may also use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies. They may collect or receive data about your use of our Commercial Services and other websites or online services. These analytics services (like Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics) provide services that analyze information regarding visits to our Online Services.

        As further described below, in exchange for your enrollment in our ExtraCare program, we may offer you special pricing or service differences, including those you become eligible for when you opt in to earn rewards at the pharmacy or enroll in ExtraCare Plus, which may be considered “financial incentive” programs under the CCPA.
        
          
        
        #### ExtraCare Member special pricing and promotions

        We may receive funding from manufacturers to offer special pricing on their products or to cover the administrative costs of sending marketing communications (e.g., direct mail, email messages) to ExtraCare members. These funding sources and amounts depend on our ability to communicate with a certain number or population of customers who are ExtraCare members.

        Participants in the ExtraCare program are given the opportunity to earn rewards at the pharmacy for pharmacy activities, such as filling a prescription or receiving an immunization. As part of this program, we may collect the following personal information:

        #### ExtraCare Plus
        
          
        
        If you join our ExtraCare Plus membership, we may offer additional ExtraBucks and members-only rewards by tracking additional data elements. As an ExtraCare Plus member, you may have the opportunity to join a third-party partners’ program at a discount. If you choose to join a third-party partners’ program through your ExtraCare Plus membership, you may receive additional ExtraBucks and members-only rewards in exchange for access and use of your information you provide to our partners as part of these third-party partners’ programs. As part of the ExtraCare Plus program, including any third-party partners’ programs you link to your ExtraCare Plus membership, we may collect the following personal information:

        For participants in the aforementioned financial incentive programs, the value of the personal information you provide is reasonably related to the value of the financial rewards provided to you. The value of personal information will vary slightly for each member depending on several factors, including but not limited to your interactions and purchases with CVS, the administrative and technical expenses associated with maintaining the ExtraCare program (e.g., IT infrastructure, customer service, marketing strategy & planning), and the extent to which you take advantage of the program’s offerings and discounts (e.g., 2% ExtraBucks rewards for purchases).
        
          
        
        You have the right to withdraw from the ExtraCare program at any time. To withdraw from the program, you must submit a request to delete your personal information from ExtraCare, as set forth in Section 12(G) above.
        
          
        
    10. ### Notice of right to opt-out of sharing or sale
        
        California residents have the right to opt out of sales and sharing of personal information. If you wish to opt out of our sharing of the limited data that is gathered when you visit our websites and other web-based services for purposes of targeted digital advertising as described in Section 12(E), above, you may do so in one of the ways described below.
        
          
        
        * Fill out [this interactive webform](https://www.cvs.com/account/compliance/do-not-sell)
        * Call us at [1-800-SHOP-CVS (1-800-746-7287)](tel:1-800-746-7287)
        
          
        
        The effectiveness of your opt-out request may be limited by our ability to associate the cookies and/or pixels that we may collect with your identity, browser, device and/or browsing session. As a result, your opt-out request will be more effective for future visits if you:
        
          
        
        * Use the same device that was used to exercise the opt-out request
        * Have not cleared cookies from your web browser
        * Are not using a private mode in your web browser
        * Provide the same personal information that you provided previously
        
          
        
        We encourage you to re-submit opt-out requests from any other devices that you may be using to visit our websites, mobile applications and other web-based services. If you sign up and log in to your CVS.com account, we will be able to associate you more easily with your visits to our websites, mobile applications and other web-based services. This will also allow us to apply a more persistent opt-out request across devices, browsers and browsing sessions, subject to the above limitations.
        
          
        
        You also have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “sharing” of your personal information, including through the use of an opt-out preference signal. If our website detects that your browser is transmitting an opt-out preference signal, such as the “global privacy control”—or GPC— signal, we will opt that browser out of cookies on our website that result in a “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information. Please note, if you come to our website from a different device or a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt out, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well.

        The effectiveness of your opt-out request may be limited by our ability to associate the cookies and/or pixels that we may collect with your identity, browser, device and/or browsing session.

        The effectiveness of your opt-out request may be limited by our ability to associate the cookies and/or pixels that we may collect with your identity, browser, device and/or browsing session. As a result, your opt-out request will be more effective for future visits if you:
        
          
        
        * Use the same device that was used to exercise the opt-out request
        * Have not cleared cookies from your web browser

        You also have the right to opt-out of targeted advertising using your personal data, including through the use of a universal opt-out mechanism. If our website detects that your browser is transmitting a universal opt-out mechanism, such as the “global privacy control” —or GPC— signal, we will opt that browser out of cookies on our website that result in a disclosure for targeted advertising of your personal data. Please note, if you come to our website from a different device or a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt out, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well.
        
          
        
        You may also give someone else permission to exercise the right to opt out sale or targeted advertising for you.

    4. ### Notice of right to opt-out
        
        If you wish to opt out of processing of personal data that is gathered when you visit our websites and other web-based services for purposes of targeted digital advertising, you may do so in one of the ways described below.
        
          
        
        * Fill out [this interactive webform](https://www.cvs.com/account/compliance/do-not-sell)

        The effectiveness of your opt-out request may be limited by our ability to associate the cookies and/or pixels that we may collect with your identity, browser, device and/or browsing session. As a result, your opt-out request will be more effective for future visits if you:
        
          
        
        * Use the same device that was used to exercise the opt-out request
        * Have not cleared cookies from your web browser
        * Are not using a private mode in your web browser
        * Provide the same personal information that you provided previously
        
          
        
        We encourage you to re-submit opt-out requests from any other devices that you may be using to visit our websites, mobile applications and other web-based services. If you sign up and log in to your CVS.com account, we will be able to associate you more easily with your visits to our websites, mobile applications and other web-based services. This will also allow us to apply a more persistent opt-out request across devices, browsers and browsing sessions, subject to the above limitations.
