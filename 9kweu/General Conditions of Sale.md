**§ 2 Commencement and end of the contract**

1\. With the online registration the user applies for use of the 9kw.eu services. The contract is deemed concluded when the user sends the completed contract to 9kw.eu.  
2\. At the end of the contract all usage rights to the 9kw.eu services are terminated.  
3\. The operator expressly reserves the right to subsequently exclude certain users or their homepages without giving any reasons from the use of the 9kw.eu services. In this case the user is refunded any usage fee paid to the operator to this day on demand.  
4\. If the user makes use of a fee-based service of 9kw.eu and terminates the contractual relationship prior to consumption of usage fees paid in advance the remaining balance goes to the operator. No refund is granted.

2\. The user receives a user name and password for the service. He is obliged not to make them available to any third party and is liable for any misuse resulting from unauthorized use of the password.
