You agree to notify Flightradar24 immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your password or account.

### 4\. Third Party Services

The Services are integrated with certain third party applications, websites, and services ("Third Party Services") to make available content, products, and/or services to you. These Third Party Services may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Services will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies. You understand and agree that Flightradar24 does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Services or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Services.

### 5\. License

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Services. Unless otherwise stated in these Terms, this right is granted for your personal, non-commercial use only. Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) from the Services for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

* Modify or copy the materials;
* Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
* Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the Services;
* Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
* Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

This license and the right to access the Services shall automatically terminate if you violate any provision of these Terms. Upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

### 6\. Paid Services

Certain Services from Flightradar24 are offered free of charge, currently called the "Basic Service". Other Services require payment before you can access them, "Paid Services". The Paid Services are currently referred to as the "Premium Services" . Currently, the Premium Services are divided into three categories: "Gold", "Silver" and "Business". You can learn more about the content of our Paid Services on our Website.

Please note that the Business Services are the only subscription whereby you are allowed to use the Services in relation to any commercial use or for any commercial purposes including any public display (commercial or non-commercial). Therefore, if you intend to make any commercial use of the Services, you must subscribe to our Business Services, whereby the license granted in clause 5 will, further to what is set out therein, also gives you a right to use the Service for commercial purposes. The Business Services license does however not grant you any right to resell or distribute any data received through the Service, unless otherwise explicitly agreed in writing.

Paid Services are entered into for a subscription period. The subscription period may be either for one (1) month at a time, for twelve (12) months at a time or for such period agreed upon between the Parties. All subscriptions (personal and business) are automatically extended by an additional subscription period at a time until you or Flightradar24 terminates the subscription. Please see your account page at our Website for more information about your subscription.

Flightradar24 or you may at any time terminate the subscription by providing a thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice. No subscription fee paid in advance for the relevant period will be repaid, but you will have the right to continue to use the Services until the end of that period.

If you wish to terminate your subscription, you may use your account page on our Website to do so. If we want to terminate the subscription, we will do so by email.

Certain in-app purchases can also be made in the form of a single payment for a time-unlimited access to certain Paid Services, limited to a specific version of our mobile applications. Such purchases are made from within the mobile application and follow the payment process of that mobile application. Please read more about in-app purchases in the specific license terms of that mobile application.

### 7\. Fees and Payment

Paid Services can be purchased on the Website or through so-called in-app purchases in some of our Apps. Except in relation to certain in-app purchases, as described above, Paid Services shall be paid as a monthly or yearly subscription fee in accordance with the price list applicable from time to time which is available on the Website or in one of our mobile applications. You may effect payment of the fee through any of the means of payment offered by us on the Website or in one of our mobile applications. If any payment is not made on the due date, your Paid Service subscription will be automatically and immediately terminated.

Flightradar24 may change the prices for the Paid Services from time to time and will notify you of any such price changes by email or through information posted on our Website. Price changes to Paid Services will take effect from the next subscription period (one or twelve months, see above) following the notification of the price change. As permitted by law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Paid Services after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by terminating the Paid Services prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.

### 8\. Trademarks and Intellectual Property Rights

Ownership and all intellectual property rights in the Services or any content on the Services, including but not limited to patents, design rights, copyrights, trademarks, trade-secrets and proprietary know-how, shall be owned by and vested in us, or our licensor, and nothing in these Terms shall be interpreted as a transfer of such rights from us to You. You are solely entitled to the limited license to the Services specifically granted under these Terms.

Specifically, the "Flightradar24" trademark and all trademarks appearing on the Services are property of us or our licensors and are protected by applicable laws. Use of these trademarks is by all means prohibited.

### 12\. No warranties

The Services and the content therein are provided "as is" and "as available". We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim any warranty, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the content accessible through the Services and other services or otherwise relating to such content or on any sites linked to the Services.

We offer no guarantee that the pages, services, functions, choices and content of the Services will be provided without interruption or errors or that any mistakes or errors will be corrected. We do not guarantee that the Services or the servers through which they become available to users do not contain viruses or other harmful components, although we make every effort to ensure it.

The Services and the content therein may include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. We do not warrant that any of the materials on the Services are accurate, complete, or current. We may make changes to the materials contained on the Services at any time without notice. We do not, however, make any commitment to update the materials.

The provided information on aircraft position and identity, in particular, originate directly from the aircraft, which transmit this information through public radio frequencies, according to the â€˜Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcastâ€™ (ADS-B). The information collected and published may contain errors, due to the intrinsic limitations of radio communications (e.g. limited coverage, interference, attenuation, special weather conditions etc.), due to erroneous configuration of the ADS-B devices on board, due to negligent data entry by aircraft crew, due to erroneous position received by the aircraft GPS and due to other factors beyond the control of the Flightradar24. Data is provided for informational purposes only and is not related by any means to the safety of navigation.

Consequently, we cannot provide any type of guarantee and are neither responsible for the correctness, validity, thoroughness and accuracy of that information published, nor for the suitability of their usage for purposes other than informational only.

### 13\. Exclusion of liability

Unless caused by our gross negligence or intent, we shall in no event be liable for any losses or damages, whether direct or indirect (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the Services or the use or inability to use the content of the Services, even if we have been notified of the possibility of such damage.

We cannot guarantee the security of any transfer of information made via the Services. We do not assume any liability for the information contained on the Services. The Services may contain links to third-party websites which are not under our control. We are not responsible for the contents of, nor do we endorse, any third-party sites that are linked to the Services. We have not reviewed content on sites other than the Services and are not responsible for such content. We expressly disclaim responsibility for all representations made or implied in relation to products, publications or sites not owned by us.

### 14\. Changes to the Services

You acknowledge and agree that nothing in these Terms constitutes an undertaking by us to provide the Services in its present form or under any specifications. We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, from time to time make additions to, deletions from, modifications to, or change the format and features of, the Services.

You further acknowledge that we may be obliged to alter, modify or reduce the extent of the Services due to mandatory law or decisions by competent governmental authorities. If such restriction apply to the Service in a way that may affect or impair the Paid Services, Flightradar24 shall bear no responsibility and shall not be obliged to perform any full or partial refund of any payments made by you for any Paid Services.

### 15\. Governing Law and disputes

Any claim relating to the Services shall be governed by the laws of Sweden without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
