                1. Creating persistent local copies of the data.

        * 6.3.2 Notwithstanding the above, the User is entitled to enrich and create derivative data set from the data for commercial purposes, subject to such enrichment and creation will be done by the User by adding significant value to the data and/or the data itself not being the main selling point.
* ### 7\. Fees and Payment
    
    * #### 7.1 Basic Services
        
    * * 7.1.1 No fees will be charged for the Basic Services.
    
    * #### 7.2 Premium Services: Silver, Gold, and Business Subscriptions
        
    * * 7.2.1 Premium Services can be purchased on the Website, or through so-called in-app purchases in some of our Apps.
        * 7.2.2 Premium Services shall be paid in advance in accordance with the price list applicable from time to time which is available on the Website or Apps. Applicable VAT is presented at the time of purchase depending on your location and classification as a private individual or a commercial entity.

        * 7.2.3 If any payment is not made by the due date, your Premium Service subscription will automatically terminate at the end of your active Subscription Period. You are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date billing information. Failure to provide accurate billing information may result in the suspension or termination of your subscription.
    
    * #### 7.3 FR24 API: Subscriptions and API Credits
        
    * * 7.3.1 Subscriptions to the FR24 API are available in accordance with the price list applicable from time to time which is available on the Website.
        * 7.3.2 Full usage of the FR24 API is subject to the User’s holding of credits which are used for each call to an endpoint (**“API Credits”**). The API Credits can be purchased within the API Portal on the Website. API Credits have a limited validity, as specified in the User’s FR24 API Account. Unused credits will expire at the end of their validity period and will not be refunded or carried over. Users have the option to set automatic top-ups of their API Credit accounts, to their chosen amount and up to the overall limit set by Flightradar24. Flightradar24 reserves the right to change this overall credit top-up limit from time to time. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that this functionality is enabled or disabled as required for their use. Flightradar24 will not be held accountable for any automatic top-ups that occur where such functionality has been set by the User and will not refund such amounts.
        * 7.3.3 The use of API Credits is dependent on the User having an active FR24 API subscription. Should an FR24 API Subscription payment not be made by the due date, the subscription will enter into a grace period of 3 days, during which Flightradar24 will attempt to authorise the payment. If the payment is not received by the end of the 3-day period, the subscription will be considered inactive, and the User will not be able to use any API Credits until the subscription is reactivated. Should an FR24 API User account be terminated, any remaining API Credits will become unusable and will not be refunded.
    
    * #### 7.4 Changes to the Fees
        
    * * 7.4.1 Flightradar24 may change the prices for the Premium Services and the FR24 API from time to time and will notify you of any such price changes and the timing thereof through information posted on our Website at least thirty (30) days before such change taking place. Any price change communicated will be applicable for the following subscription period.
        * 7.4.2 As permitted by law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Premium Services and the FR24 API after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by terminating the Premium Services or FR24 API prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.

    * 10.2 Usage of the Services does not grant you any rights to transfer, sublicense, resell, or assign the Service, its content, intellectual property rights, or any related rights to any third party.

    * 11.3 The transmission of data to us must be done in real time. It is strictly forbidden to send any delayed or modified or manipulated or fabricated data, except where explicitly agreed otherwise in writing, as this would give an erroneous and misleading picture about the current positions of aircraft.
    * 11.4 Users who provide us with data automatically rendered from aircraft transponders grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use for any purpose, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, display, translate, and distribute the data (in whole or in part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or hereafter developed.
