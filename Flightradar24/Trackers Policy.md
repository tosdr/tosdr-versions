Social plug-ins
---------------

When you encounter an implemented social plug-in (e.g. "like" button) from a third party, such as Facebook, Twitter or Google, while using our Service, your browser or App, as applicable, will establish a direct link to that third party ("Social Plug-in") and will then transmit the following data to the Social Plug-in directly:

1. date and time of your visit;
2. the Internet address/URL of the site that you are currently visiting;
3. your IP address;
4. your browser;
5. your operating system;
6. your user code if you are a registered user of Social Plug-in and if applicable your surname and first name; and
7. if you click on the plug-in, of course the information that you have used this specific plug-in.

We explicitly make reference to the fact that we ourselves do not have any influence on the scope of the data which Social Plug-in collects with the help of the plug-in and that with regard to data protection we have to rely on the data usage guideline of Social Plug-in. Please inform yourself further on Social Plug-in specifically about the purpose and scope of the data collection and your rights in this regard and the setting options to protect your privacy using the data usage guidelines.

However, it is of course possible to prevent the placing of cookies by settings in your browser. In addition, it is also possible to block the social plug-ins of Social Plug-in with add-ons for your browser.
