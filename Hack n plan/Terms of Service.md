4.2. HacknPlan reserves the right to review and update the content and functionality of its platform.

4.3. All user and project information is stored in the HacknPlan cloud servers, and access to such information is private. Users can share their projects with other platform users explicitly.

5.2. This mode must be contracted by paying in advance (monthly or yearly) and their amount will change depending on the number of user seats of the team or organization.

Accordingly, the customer can expand the number of user seats subscribed at any time by paying the proportional share for the current billing period, and the new total amount in the next.

The customer can also reduce the number of users subscribed, in which case the paid but not enjoyed amount will be added as credit to the user account in order to be used to cover future payments. This credit will be lost if the user explicitly removes the account.

5.3. In this mode, the subscription fee will be charged by the payment method (from those authorized in clause 8.2) used by the client to hire the service in each billing period (monthly or yearly).

5.4. In this mode, the cancellation of the subscription requested by the client will be effective, for the purposes of suspension of payment of the fee, at the end of the current billing period or, if the user requests it, immediately.

5.5 If the payment of a billing period is not carried out successfully, the customer will be informed by email and the charge will be retried automatically up to 3 times during the next 10 days. If all the automated retries fail, the subscription will be canceled and the account will be automatically converted into a free account. All project information compatible with the free version will remain intact.

5.6. Due to the nature of the service, money paid will not be refundable at the time of the cancellation request, except for special cases like fraud or error on our side.

6.2. After the trial is over, and considering the user did not explicitly subscribe to any premium plan, the account will go back to the free mode, and all the information or actions executed during the trial that are compatible with the free version will remain. Once the period is over, the user won’t be able to try any premium feature ever again.

6.3. The trial mode availability is bound to a physical person in the case of the Personal Plus plan, and a company in the case of the Studio plan.

6.4. The abuse of the trial mode such as the continuous use of free accounts by the same person or studio with the intention of using the premium features for a longer period is completely and explicitly prohibited. If this behavior is detected, it will be considered a violation of the current Terms and Conditions and the account of the user will be suspended.
