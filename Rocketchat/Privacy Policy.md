Rocket.Chat Technologies Corp. ('us', 'we', or 'our') operates the [Rocket.Chat website](https://rocket.chat/) (), Rocket.Chat Services, including the Marketplace and associated Rocket.Chat Apps, Rocket.Chat´s Cloud Hosting Services, the Rocket.Chat [open server](https://open.rocket.chat/), and the Rocket.Chat mobile applications (the 'Services').

Please note that additional privacy policies may apply to Rocket.Chat's specific services. These policies can be visited [here](https://handbook.rocket.chat/departments-and-operations/legal/privacy-policies).

### At a glance

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Services and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Services. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Customer Terms of Service.

**Administrators are responsible for users' privacy, and we help administrators**

* There are basically two ways of using Rocket. Chat: Self-hosted (also known as on-premises deployment) on your own or someone else's infrastructure or via our Cloud-hosted services. In both cases, the administrator of that instance - or the organization behind the administrator - is the person responsible for ensuring the privacy of Rocket.Chat users.
    
* We aim to help by providing product and service features to make that job easier.
    
* We also provide this policy to explain what we do as a "helping hand"/data processor for administrators in case we process users' personal data.
    

**Data handling on a self-hosted deployment**

* We cannot access Customer user-generated data in a Self-Hosted instance of Rocket.Chat.
    
* Rocket.Chat code is open source; there are no back doors whatsoever.
    
* Customers may desire to connect a self-hosted instance to other services, e.g., our marketplace or push notification gateway, where this privacy policy applies. You can also connect it to third-party services, such as external authentication services, in which case their privacy policy applies. It is Customer's choice, and Customers are not forced to do so.
    

**Data handling on a cloud hosting services**

* In the Rocket.Chat Cloud hosted offering; we only process Customer data for the purpose of providing customers the service in the name of the administrator. Administrators are still in full control over the configuration of their instances.
    
* For more information on data processing in the cloud hosting services, please refer to [the distinction of data collection between self-hosted workspaces and cloud hosting workspaces](https://docs.rocket.chat/v1/docs/privacy-policy#the-distinction-of-data-collection-between-self-hosted-workspaces-and-cloud-hosting-workspaces) and [privacy notice for the cloud hosting services](https://docs.rocket.chat/v1/docs/privacy-notice-for-the-cloud-hosting-services).

**Usage data** means data collected automatically, either generated by using the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).

**Data controller** means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is, or is to be, processed. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your Personal Data.

**Data subject** (or User) Data Subject is any living individual who is using our Service and is the subject of Personal Data.

**Tracking technologies** also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.

### The type of data we collect

In connection with our operations and during the lifecycle of business relationships with our customers, we collect various types of personal data, meaning any information that identifies or allows us to identify you.

**Personal data**

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you (_personal data_). Personally identifiable information may include but is not limited to

* Email addresses
    
* First name and last name
    
* Cookies and usage data
    
* Phone number and other contact details
    

**Account data**

Some services may allow or require that you register for a personalized account. Account data may include your account name, authentication information, registration date, contact information, payment information, and any other information associated with your account.

This usage data may include information such as your computer's internet protocol address (_IP address_), browser type, browser version, the pages of our service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.

When you access the services by or through a mobile device, this usage data may include information such as the type of mobile device you use, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the app version, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.

**Location data**

You can enable or disable location services when you use our service at any time through your device settings.

**App data**

#### Apps provided By Rocket.Chat

When you use the Marketplace, you may choose to install Apps provided by Rocket.Chat. These Apps process data from your instance of Rocket.Chat and, therefore, nonpersonal data, such as software version, amount of users, and similar. Depending on the purpose and your actual usage of the App (e.g., enabling certain features), personal data may be processed. For example, you enable an integration that processes your users' information. The description of the App will make the types of personal data sufficiently clear, as well as any potential deviations from this policy.

#### Third-party apps

For Third-party apps on the [marketplace](https://docs.rocket.chat/v1/docs/rocketchat-marketplace), the vendor will provide you with a specific privacy policy that governs their Third-party app.

**Tracking & cookies data**

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.

* We DO NOT track activity in your self-hosted instances.
    
* We regularly monitor aggregated activity data on our infrastructure, but it is not tracking individual users in the sense of this paragraph, which only occurs when we have a legitimate interest in doing so (e.g., for security and compliance purposes).
    
* We do perform regular tracking on our [open server](https://open.rocket.chat/).
    

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.

Examples of cookies we use:

* Session cookies: We use session cookies to operate our service.
    
* Preference cookies: We use preference cookies to remember your preferences and various settings.
    
* Security cookies: We use security cookies for security purposes.
    

[](#workspace-tracking-and-statistics-data)**Workspace tracking and statistics data**

Rocket.Chat workspaces are set up to send anonymous and non-personal usage tracking data to Rocket.Chat automatically. This is done to help us understand how customers use our services, ensure compliance with the terms of use limits, and for billing purposes if the customer's contract is based on consumption of our services.

The information shared is the same data displayed on the administration panel's [Workspace](https://docs.rocket.chat/v1/docs/workspace) page.

For example, the tracking statistics sharing will transmit the total number of channels, but not the actual channel names, to preserve your workspace's privacy. Disabling this tracking statistics collection may be possible depending on the services and plans purchased.

Please refer to the [how do we secure your data section](https://docs.rocket.chat/v1/docs/privacy-policy) for further details. Additionally, our Subprocessors section provides information about our Cloud Infrastructure and Subprocessors.

Changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective once they are posted on this page, and we will also update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

The distinction of data collection between self-hosted workspaces and cloud hosting workspaces
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following paragraph is intended to provide clarity on data processing in Rocket.Chat workspaces. Please note that there are differences in the data processing that occurs between self-hosted workspaces and workspaces hosted by us. Our Cloud Hosting service processes all data input into the workspace on our infrastructure.

The table below explains the general distinction between the data processed in each case. It's important to remember that individual circumstances, such as apps installed on unregistered workspaces via workarounds, may vary.

| Data Type | Self-Hosted | Cloud Hosted at Rocket.Chat |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account Data | Yes. To register your workspace via an account, | Yes. To register your workspace via an account |
| Usage Data | Yes. As per the service you are consuming via your registration, e.g., push notifications via our gateway, | Yes. As part of using the hosted workspace on our infrastructure |
| App Data | Yes. If you install apps from the marketplace, and based on the app's use case, third-party apps have their own privacy policies. | Yes, if you install apps from the marketplace based on their use case. Third-party apps have their own privacy policies. |
| User Generated Content | No. Content is not processed unless it falls under the aforementioned (e.g. the content of a push notification sent via our gateway). | Yes. As part of using the hosted workspace on our infrastructure. End-to-end encrypted content is only stored in encrypted form. |
| Tracking and Cookies | Yes. We track your usage of services (usage data) on our end. We do not track inside the workspace. | Tracking occurs to monitor the consumption of the services used. |

There are two classifications for [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) self-hosted workspaces: registered and non-registered. Registered workspaces have access to a wide range of features and services and are eligible for our "starter" or paid plans (dependent on user counts and functionality requirements). Note that non-registered workspaces operate independently without formal registration and no data collection by [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/). Non-registered workspaces are only available via the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) self-build deployment path.
