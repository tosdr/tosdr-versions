Failure to observe the Code of Conduct may result in participants being asked to leave. The Royal Ballet School reserves the right, at its discretion, to refuse admission to any participants prior to, or during the course. In this instance, no refund will be given.

By signing up to Royal Ballet School events or courses, participants are agreeing they are fit and well enough to take part and take full responsibility for their personal well-being.

##### Eligibility

Where applicable, participants must be of the minimum age and/or level stated in the relevant course information in order to participate on the chosen course. The Royal Ballet School reserves the right to return applications which do not meet the age or level required.

##### Photography and recordings

Recording or photography, with or without flash is strictly forbidden by all event attendees or visitors to the school.

The Royal Ballet School reserves the right for the School or third parties to carry out general filming, photography and sound recording in or around the buildings.  
Sometimes an image might single an event attendee out in its focus. These images, photos and video, may be used in a range of ways to promote the work of the School. This might include use on the School website, social media or as part of a School publication. The photos may also be sent to journalists for use in press articles. Some image uses are also necessary for administration and the safety of pupils, such as CCTV.

Occasionally The Royal Ballet School may be involved in press photo shoots, filming, interviews or public events and event attendees may be asked to participate in these. Such activity will be for printed, broadcast media and the internet and often involves working with collaborators or partners approved by the School, such as the Royal Opera House. Activity of this nature always takes place under the strict control and supervision of our Marketing team and resultant material is used to promote the values and key messages of The Royal Ballet School.

By booking an event, course, programme, or attending an audition, the participant consents to be photographed or sound recorded and to the commercial exploitation of such film or recording without any right to payment.  
Any participant who objects to being photographed or recorded must indicate this by contacting us by email prior to the event.

##### Teacher training webinars

By booking an event, course, programme, webinar, or attending an audition, the participant consents to be photographed, filmed or sound recorded and to the commercial exploitation of such photograph, film or sound recording without any right to payment.  
Sharing digital links giving access to the School’s programmes e.g. Zoom are to be used only by the person booking a webinar and must not be shared with any third party. Recording of the event is strictly prohibited.

##### Smoking

The Royal Ballet School has a non-smoking policy. Smoking, including e-cigarettes, and the use of legal highs are not permitted on the premises.

##### Personal property

The Royal Ballet School cannot be held responsible for any personal property. For some courses, lockers are provided.

##### Studios

Participants should not use or move any of the equipment unless authorised to do so. Please refer to section 28 of our Health and Safety policy for more detail.  
Only water in plastic or metal bottles may be taken in to the studios.

##### Data protection

The Royal Ballet School is committed to protecting any personal information you share with us.  
Please read our [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.royalballetschool.org.uk/privacy/) to find out more.

##### Access requirements
