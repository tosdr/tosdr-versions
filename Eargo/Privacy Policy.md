Cookies, Web Beacons
--------------------

"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies for these purposes. We use Cookies, clear gifs, web beacons or similar devices (including session Cookies, i.e., Cookies that will persist only until you end your session on the Service, and persistent Cookies, i.e., Cookies that persist even after you end your session on the Service) to help us improve the Service by tracking your navigation habits, collecting Aggregate Information customizing your experience with the Service and for analytics and fraud prevention. Some of our business partners, including but not limited to Google Analytics, Optimizely and Facebook, use Cookies (or clear gifs, web beacons or similar devices) to enhance or improve the user experience and Service and/or show Eargo ads on other websites and services based on information collected about your use of the Service and based on your particular interests (as inferred from your online activity). This type of advertising is commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising.

We use your browsing history and Personal Information to display interest-based advertising that is relevant to you. We place interest-based advertisements on our website as well as other third-party sites. The browsing history we use is collected by us and by third parties on our website, as well as other sites. We may also share your anonymous browsing history from our website and Personal Information with third parties to provide relevant ads. They may combine this information with assumptions based on the other websites you have visited in order to tailor ads to you.

Cookie Preferences
------------------

We have implemented our Cookie Preference Manager on our web site, you can find it by clicking on the Cookie Preferences link at the bottom of any of our web pages.

We group cookies on our site into three categories according to how we use them and what choices you may have:

* **Required Cookies:** These cookies are necessary for basic features of this site to function, such as allowing images to load or allowing you to select your cookie preferences. Following are our uses of required cookies:
    * Authenticate and Sign You In: When you sign into one of our web sites, we store the time you sign in and a unique ID number in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within our web sites without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information, so you do not have to sign in each time you return to our web sites.
    * Security: We use cookies to detect fraud and abuse of our web sites and services.
    * Store Information You Provide to a Web Site: When you provide information or add applications, products, software or services to a shopping cart when shopping on our web sites, we store data in a cookie to remember the products and information you have added and/or your interactions with us online.

    * Store Your Preferences and Settings: Settings that enable our products to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. We may save preferences, such as device (i.e., computer, laptop or mobile device) language, browser and multimedia player settings, so those do not have to be reset each time you return to our web sites.

Security
--------

Eargo will not be liable for disclosures of your Personal Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. We have undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized internet access to visitor data retained in our internal servers. We also store Personal Information in certain third-party external databases (such as the Salesforce CRM system) that we reasonably believe comply with generally accepted industry standards to protect Personal Information. When we request that you enter sensitive information (such as your bank account and routing number, your SSN), we encrypt such information using a Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) standard. Additionally, we use the DigiCert SSL standard to verify the secure nature of our website to users’ browsers.

Despite the measures we take to protect your Personal Information, due to the inherent open nature of the internet, Eargo cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk. You must accept all risks associated with any data transmission, including the risk that your Personal Information may be intercepted in transit.

We retain non-personally identifiable information collected via our Service for as long as we have a business reason to do so. After that time, we aggregate the data and retain it for analytical purposes. We retain your Personal Information for as long as your Service participation is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter (in the event that you choose to engage with us again). We also may retain your Personal Information for a longer period of time as needed to provide you services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your Personal Information, we may continue to retain and use aggregate, anonymous data previously collected and/or anonymize and aggregate your Personal Information.
