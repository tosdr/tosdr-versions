We rely on the following legal basis, under UK data protection law, to process your personal

data:

● Where we have obtained your consent, for example to action a request from you or

respond to your specific query. You can withdraw your consent at any time, but we may

still need to retain a record of your correspondence with us.

Transfer of personal information



GV is headquartered in the US, with an office in the UK. Consequently, any information we

collect will be transferred to, and stored in, the US and other countries where the data protection

laws may offer a lower standard of protection than in your country of residence. Where personal

information is transferred outside the UK, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure

that it is subject to appropriate safeguards and that it is treated securely and in accordance with

this Privacy Policy.

adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. We comply with the EU-U.S and Swiss-US Privacy

Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection,

use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, United

Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the

terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles

shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view our certification,

Accountability for onward transfers



We are responsible and remain liable for the processing of personal information we receive,

under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, including if we subsequently transfer to a third party

acting as an agent on its behalf. We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward

transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer

liability provisions.



With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield

Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade

Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in

response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law

enforcement requirements.



Resolution of Privacy Shield queries and complaint mechanism



In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our

collection or use of your personal information. European Economic Area and Swiss individuals

with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at

privacy@gv.com.



We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS. If you do not

receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your

complaint, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield or to file a

complaint visit https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim. The

Principles, a binding arbitration option may also be made available to you in order to address

residual complaints not resolved by any other means.



We commit to cooperate with the EU DPA panel established by the EU data protection

authorities ("EU DPA panel") and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information

Commissioner (as applicable) and to comply with the advice given such EU DPA panel and/or

Right to access, update and delete your personal information



If you are a resident of California or the UK and/or your personal information is processed in

the context of our UK office, you have certain legal rights in respect of the personal information

about you held by us, including, for California residents, your rights under the California

Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This includes the right to obtain a copy of this information on

request, and the right to correct, amend or delete such personal information or object to it being

used for certain purposes (including marketing). We may ask you to verify your identity before

we can act on your request.



We will comply with any requests to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable law, and

so there may be circumstances where we are entitled to refuse your request. For example,

where permitted to by law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require

disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally

changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for

instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).



Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so free of charge, except

where it would require a disproportionate effort (where we are permitted to charge a fee under

applicable law). We aim to maintain any information we hold and our Site in a manner that

protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.



To make any requests regarding your personal information, or if you have any questions or

concerns regarding your personal information, you should contact us at privacy@gv.com. You

are also entitled to contact your local supervisory authority for data protection. In the UK, the

data protection authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office.



Right to object



You have the right to object (opt-out) of your personal information being used for purposes

which are materially different to the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this

Privacy Policy (including being disclosed to a third party). We may refuse your request where

we have a right to do so (for example, if the use is necessary to comply with a legal obligation).

To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at privacy@gv.com



Information that we share



We do not sell your personal information. We share personal information with companies,

organisations and individuals outside of GV in the following circumstances:

● With your consent



We may share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside

GV when we have your consent to do so.

● For external processing



We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons

to process it for us or for similar reasons (for example, in connection with using shared

compute resources and servers), based on our instructions and in compliance with our

Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

● With our legal and professional advisors



We share information with our legal and other professional advisors, for example if they

are advising us on an investment transaction or where otherwise necessary to obtain

their advice.

● For legal reasons



We may share personal information with companies, organisations or individuals outside

GV if we have a belief in good faith that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the

information is reasonably necessary to:

● meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable

governmental request;

● enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential

violations;● detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;

and/or● protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of GV, our users or

the public, as required or permitted by law.

If GV is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale of GV, we will use reasonable

endeavours to ensure the personal information we process continues to be subject to the same

protections set out in this Privacy Policy.



Information security



We work hard to protect our Site and any information that we hold from unauthorized access or

unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction. In particular:

● We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including

physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.

● We restrict access to personal information to GV employees, contractors, service

providers and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for

us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. They may

be disciplined or their contract terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.



When this Privacy Policy applies



Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered and businesses operated by GV, but

excludes services and businesses that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate

this Privacy Policy.



Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered or businesses operated by other

companies or individuals. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other

companies and organisations that advertise our services and that may use cookies, pixel tags

and other technologies.
