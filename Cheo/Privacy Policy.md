To provide the best care possible, we need to collect and use information about you and your family. CHEO is committed to keeping your information safe and confidential, and follows legislative rules about collecting, using and disclosing your information.

**Did you know:** CHEO, The Ottawa Hospital and SickKids in Toronto are part of Epic's Care Everywhere network, which allows your patient health record to be securely accessed by our partner hospitals if you are ever at one of these hospitals for care. This could also include US hospitals, which means your personal health information would be leaving Canada if you seek care at a US hospital. Your health information will only ever be accessed by the health care professionals caring for you.  
  
If you would like more information about Care Everywhere or would like to opt-out of having your information shared via Care Everywhere, contact the CHEO Privacy Office at [privacy@cheo.on.ca.](mailto:privacy@cheo.on.ca "Open new window to view privacy@cheo.on.ca.")

| ### How we protect your information |
| We have safeguards (e.g. security, passwords, and policies) in place to make sure your information stays private. Only people who need to see your personal health information are allowed to look at it.<br><br>#### Consent<br><br>We assume you give consent to share your information with people involved in your care, and we will ask for your consent before we collect, use or share your information for any purpose other than our stated activities. You may also withhold or withdraw this consent at any time by contacting the Health Records Department.<br><br>#### Video surveillance<br><br>CHEO collects personal information through recorded images in our surveillance system, such as the security cameras at entrances and exits. The purpose of this collection is for safety and security operations in accordance with privacy provisions in FIPPA and MFIPPA. If you have questions or concerns about the use of video surveillance at CHEO, please reach out to our Security Team at extension 2227 or the Freedom of Information Office (FOI) at 3646. |
| ### How we use your information |
| * To provide care for you - your information is used by your care providers and trainees who are part of your health care team.<br>* To teach - your information may be used to support our partnership with the University of Ottawa and other schools.<br>* To conduct research and compile statistics - researchers may use your health information while working on a study approved by the CHEO Research Ethics Board.<br>* To improve the care we provide by conducting quality improvement and risk management activities.<br>* To obtain payment for your treatment.<br><br>CHEO may also use or disclose your personal health information in the following ways, unless you tell us not to:<br><br>* Share your information, in whole or in part, with outside health care providers involved in your care, which may include access to your electronic health record.<br>* Conduct patient satisfaction surveys - we want to hear from you about the quality of care and service you received at CHEO. We use this information to help improve the care we will provide in the future.<br>* Support fundraising activities - our Foundation is dedicated to supporting CHEO by raising funds for research, medical education, and the improvement of patient care.

The people who may see your information include:<br><br>* You, or the person responsible for making decisions for you.<br>* Your care providers, both inside and outside the hospital.<br>* eCHN (electronic Child Health Network). CHEO is a member of this program that allows doctors and health-care professionals at other eCHN member locations involved in the care of your child to have quick access to your child's health information from CHEO. This information will help doctors and health-care professionals in making decisions regarding the care of your child.<br>* ConnectingOntario. This is a provincial Electronic Health Record program that provides health-care providers with access to your child's health information from CHEO. Access to the ConnectingOntario Clinical Viewer is restricted to those who provide or assist with patient care. CHEO, along with all other organizations participating in the ConnectingOntario program, must follow all applicable health privacy laws (including the Personal Health Information and Protection Act, 2004).<br>* CHEO shares Epic (our electronic health record) with the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (SickKids). Only patients who receive care at both locations will have their information shared with SickKids. Epic’s Care Everywhere functionality allows health care professionals that are treating you to securely access your medical records at partner hospitals. If you do not wish for your information to be shared, please contact the Privacy Team at [privacy@cheo.on.ca](mailto:privacy@cheo.on.ca)<br>* People working for a health agency, such as the Ministry of Health, if required by law.<br>* Other people for whom you have given your consent, or when required by law. |
