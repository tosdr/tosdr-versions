Your right to cancel and receive a refund depends on the type of product you have purchased from PlayStation™Store:

* [](#games)[Games, game add-ons, in-game consumables and season passes](#games)
* [Pre-Orders](#pre-orders)
* [Promotional Bundles such as “3 for 2”](#promotional-bundles)
* [Subscription Services](#subscription-services)

* [Change of Online ID](#change-of-online-id)
* [Purchases made outside of PlayStation™Store](#purchases)
* [Further Information](#further-information)
* [How to request a Refund](#refund)

In addition to the rights set forth below, you may have additional rights under applicable local law; nothing in the policy below limits or replaces any such rights under local law.

### Games, game add-ons, in-game consumables and season passes

**Games and game add-ons**

You can cancel a game or game add-on purchase within 14 days from the date of purchase and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming it.

Games or add-ons that you have started downloading or streaming are not eligible for a refund unless they are faulty.

**In-game Consumables**

In-game consumables are items such as virtual currencies (e.g. FIFA packs or GTA Cash Packs), boosts and other items that are depleted during gameplay.

When you purchase in-game consumables on the PlayStation™Store outside of gameplay they will be delivered to you when you next launch the game. This means that, provided you do not launch the game after your purchase, you will have up to 14 days from the date of your purchase to cancel. If the in-game consumable has been delivered to you (for example if you launch the game immediately after your purchase) you are not eligible for a refund unless it’s faulty.

If you purchase in-game consumables during gameplay, they will be delivered immediately. This means you will not be able to cancel your purchase unless it's faulty.

**Season Passes**

You can cancel your purchase of a season pass within 14 days from the date of purchase and receive a refund. However if you have started downloading or streaming any digital items (e.g. game add-ons) included in the season pass you will not be able to cancel your purchase unless it’s faulty.

### Pre-Orders

You may cancel a pre-order at any time before the release date and receive a refund. See more information about cancelling a pre-order [here.](https://www.playstation.com/support/store/cancel-ps-store-pre-order/)[](https://www.playstation.com/support/store/cancel-ps-store-pre-order/)

If you purchased your pre-order within 14 days of the release date and the release date has passed, you can still change your mind and request a refund up to 14 days after payment was taken for the pre-order, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming the main part of the pre-ordered content to your device.

If you have started to download the main part of the order, you will not be able to obtain a refund unless the item is faulty. If you have not started to download the main part of the order and your order includes immediately accessible extra content (for example, pre-order bonus content), this extra content will stop working if you cancel your pre-order.

Please be aware that downloads will happen automatically if Automatic Downloads are enabled in your system settings. You can turn off Automatic Downloads at any time in your system settings.

### Promotional Bundles

You can cancel your purchase of a promotional bundle (e.g. 3 games for the price of 2) within 14 days from the date of purchase and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming any part of the bundle. Otherwise you will not be able to obtain a refund unless one of the items is faulty.

### Subscription Services

Based on the agreement and acknowledgment you make when you first purchase your subscription, you can cancel your purchase and request a refund within 14 days from the initial transaction date, even after you start using the subscription.

If you take advantage of a free trial when you sign up to a service, the 14-day cancellation period will commence on the day we accept your order of the free trial and the duration of the free trial will be included in the 14-day period. For example, you sign up for a free trial which lasts 7 days and your wallet is debited for the subscription at the end of the trial, you will have 7 days after your wallet was debited to cancel.

**Note**: When you purchase a subscription service such as PlayStation®Plus, you agree to a rolling subscription with periodic billing (e.g. annual billing). You can stop making payments at any time by changing your subscription payment settings (click [here](https://www.playstation.com/support/store/cancel-ps-store-subscription/) for more information on how to do this).  When you do this your subscription will continue until the next payment is due, at which point it will end.

### Wallet top ups  

You cannot cancel a PSN Wallet top-up. When you ask us to top up your PSN Wallet, we seek your consent to perform the top up immediately and, therefore, you cannot cancel the top up.

### Change of Online ID

You can revert to a previous online ID for free but you cannot cancel or obtain a refund for your purchase of a change of online ID unless faulty.

### Purchases made outside of PlayStation™Store

This policy does not cover refunds for purchases made outside of PlayStation™Store, such as purchases made on PlayStation Direct, gift cards or vouchers purchased from other retailers.

For more information on refunds and returns from PlayStation Direct click [here.](https://direct.playstation.com/returns-refund-policy)
