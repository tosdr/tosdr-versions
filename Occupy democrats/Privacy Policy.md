Privacy
=======

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is effective as of June 19, 2019, and as updated on August 23rd, 2022 at the bottom.

Occupy Democrats (“Occupy Democrats,” “we,” or “us”) respects the privacy of its members (“you”) and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website or application (our “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy does not govern how information is used by parties that we do not control or by individuals who we do not employ. If you visit a website or app that we mention or link to, be sure to review their privacy policy.

PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

There are limited pieces of information in this Policy that we may collect from you that are “Personally Identifiable Information,” or “PII”. These are your name, home zip code, email address, and any additional details that you voluntarily provide to us. We take our collection of PII and your privacy expectations very seriously and therefore have very restricted rules for handling, using and sharing this information, as described in this Policy. It is up to you whether to disclose PII to us, although if you do not do so, certain products and services may not be available for your use in Occupy Democrats.

INFORMATION THAT YOU POST TO OCCUPY DEMOCRATS

There are many functions and areas of our website and applications where you can post information about yourself, your views, and your affiliations. It is important to remember that some of these areas are publicly viewable to other users and organizations using Occupy Democrats. Occupy Democrats does not control which information you post to publicly viewable areas on Occupy Democrats. For instance, if you sign in with Facebook, the first name of your Facebook account may act as your username. Users with access to Occupy Democrats will be able to see that. Similarly, placing contact information in your profile or sharing actions that you take on Occupy Democrats via your social networks will enable access to that information to third parties in a manner that we cannot control. It is important to distinguish your provision of PII to us directly, which we can control under this Policy, versus information you post publicly or provide to other people, to organizations, or via other services, which Occupy Democrats cannot control.

ANONYMOUS INFORMATION

We also collect information about the use of the Occupy Democrats platform which does not reveal your identity. This information includes browser and device information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies, and demographic information and other non-identifying information provided by you (such as a zip code or general geographic area)

HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION

There are multiple ways we use your information to provide the best service possible to you. In doing so, we may use your PII and Your Views to draw your attention to issues in which we believe you may be interested, and to communicate directly with you through email, social media, or in your usage of our services. Here are some examples of the ways we might use your information:

* We use your information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as when you vote on an issue, author an opinion, or participate in other activities.
* We use your information to communicate directly and provide to you information regarding our services and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

For example, we may compile statistics about the percentage of our users within a state, zip codes, or cluster of zip codes who care about animal rights, or the age range of those users.
* Notwithstanding any other provision, we partner with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer, device, or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share personal information with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your name, postal address, email address, or device ID. Our partners may link the nonpersonal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
