Our Privacy Policy
------------------

We respect and honor your privacy! Any and all information collected at this site will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed. Any information you give to Chaos Software Group, Inc. will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to. A more detailed explanation about how we safeguard your personal information is described below. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [let us know](https://www.chaossoftware.com/contact.aspx).

1. **We use secured servers.**  
    Your personal information provided through our online store is fully secured and protected through Secure Socket Layers (SSL). All of your personal information such as your name, email address, and credit card number are encrypted and made unintelligible to hackers.
2. **We do not sell, rent, lease, or supply your personal information to any third parties.**  
    It is common in this day and age to buy a product or supply an email address and then to receive significant amounts of unrelated mail from third parties who have obtained your information from the place you made your purchase. Unlike the norm, we guard your information and do not sell it, rent it, lease it, or otherwise supply it to anyone else for any purpose.
3. **All information provided to us is considered confidential.**  
    Any personal information provided in our online store is used ONLY for processing your order. We will not call or contact you by mail in the future, nor use the information you provide for any purpose other than adding you to our own low-traffic announcement email list if you opt-in or choose to be added to it.
4. **We would never intentionally send our customers unsolicited emails.**  
    Users who make a purchase from our online store or who specifically request to be subscribed are added to our Chaos Software Group email announcement mailing list. All emails come specifically from us - we do not share or sell our email lists with anyone but guard them as an important company asset. This list is not a high-traffic list. You will be send an announcement from us only when we have something we feel is significant to our users . Our email list is also very easy to "opt-out" of to remove yourself from future communications, should you choose to do so.
5. **Personal Cookies we create and use are destroyed automatically.**  
    Browser "cookies" used to remember your progress while making purchases in our online store and are destroyed automatically at the end of your browser session. These "purchase" cookies NEVER contain your credit card information. Nothing temporarily stored in a "purchase" cookie is available to any other sites on the Internet.
