Privacy Policy
=====================

_Privacy Policy_
================

Our Privacy Policy has changed. Please review it carefully because your use of Myspace is governed by this updated Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://myspace.com/pages/terms).

**Effective Date:** This Privacy Policy was last revised on June 25, 2024.

Myspace LLC ("**Myspace**," "**we**," "**our**," or "**us**") recognizes the importance of consumer privacy and we take this issue seriously. Accordingly, we have designed this Privacy Policy (this "**Policy**") in a format that is easy to navigate so that you can better understand our privacy practices with respect to the information provided or collected on or through any of the [Myspace Services](#1.) (defined below) that contain a link to this Policy. The Myspace Services are operated by Myspace, a company with a mailing address of 2722 Michelson Dr. #100, Irvine, CA 92612, which is owned by the digital media company Viant Technology ("**VIANT**"). Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with this entire Policy prior to providing us with any information through the Myspace Services. Throughout the Policy we use capitalized defined terms. These terms are intended to have the meaning given to them in the Policy.

Residents of certain U.S. states have certain rights regarding their Personal Information. View our [Enterprise-wide Privacy Notice](https://myspace.com/pages/privacy?page=enterprise) for more information. To the extent that there is a conflict between this Policy and our Enterprise-wide Privacy Notice, the Enterprise-wide Privacy Notice will control.

You should read the entire Policy, but to facilitate your review, the bullet points below are a partial list of some of the key topics that are discussed in greater detail throughout the Policy.

* This Policy only applies to your activities on the Myspace Services that contain a link to the Policy, and it does not govern activities that are unrelated to the Myspace Services.
* We collect certain information about you when you interact with the Myspace Services (e.g., Usage Information), both by directly asking you to provide us with such information and by automatically collecting it, including through the use of Web Technologies. Some of this information may be disclosed or made available to third parties, including our affiliate VIANT, other Users and Visitors and service providers , as described further below. Our affiliate VIANT further discloses, or makes available, the Myspace data they receive from us to their VIANT’s clients and others.
* Third parties – including linked services (_e.g._, Facebook, Twitter), service providers and our affiliate VIANT may also collect certain information about you in connection with your use of the Myspace Services (_e.g._, Usage Information).
* Your media consumption activities (_e.g._, streaming and downloading music, streaming video, IPTV, digital video, etc.) may be tracked through your use of the Myspace Services, subject to some limited preference settings. We may use and disclose this media content consumption information as provided below for up to two (2) years from the date in which you consent unless you otherwise withdraw your consent. Due to the nature of our platform, if you withdraw your consent your Member account may be inactivated in whole or in part, but you can still use the Myspace Services as a Visitor. If we obtain a new consent from you after the date that we obtain your original consent, this period will be extended for additional two (2) year periods each time we obtain a new consent from you. If your account is inactive for over two years, we may still store your media content consumption information for a reasonable period of time so that it will be available again if you reactivate your account. However, we are not obliged to store that information. Please review the terms of our [Video Privacy Policy](https://myspace.com/pages/videoprivacy), which supplements this Policy.
* At this time, Myspace does not serve advertisements to Users as part of the Myspace Services, but does share your personal information with our corporate affiliate VIANT, who may share it with other third parties, including advertisers. Residents of some states can opt-out of our sharing, selling and targeting here, and VIANT’s sharing, selling and targeting here For more information see our [Enterprise-wide Privacy Notice](https://myspace.com/pages/privacy?page=enterprise).

Privacy Policy
--------------

1. Who We Are
    
    Welcome to Myspace®, a place where people come to connect, discover, and share. The Myspace Services may include: (i) those offered on any Myspace-­branded URL, including [www.myspace.com](https://www.myspace.com/) (the "**Myspace Website**"); (ii) Myspace messaging services (e.g., instant messaging, private messaging, public and private group chatting, etc.); and (iii) any other features, content, or applications offered or operated from time to time by Myspace in connection with Myspace's business, including when Myspace is accessed via the internet, mobile device, television or other device (collectively, the "**Myspace Services**"). The Myspace Services are hosted in the United States. We may also transfer your data to other countries for processing by staff who work for us or for one of our contractors.
    

3. Scope Of This Policy
    
    This Policy describes generally how we collect, use, store and share information that we receive from users of the Myspace Services ("**Users**"). This Policy applies both to individuals using such services that register with Myspace and create Myspace Accounts and their associated Profile(s) ("**Members**"), as well as individuals who use the Myspace Services without registering ("**Visitors**"). This Policy covers the activities of Myspace with respect to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of information through any of the Myspace Services. If you follow a link on the Myspace Services to a third party’s website, that third party’s privacy policy will govern its use of your information, and you should read the third party website’s privacy policy. This Policy does not limit Myspace's use or sharing of De-identified Information.
    
    We may aggregate certain items of your Personal Information (such as your age) to create anonymized statistical information about our User base (which we refer to as "**Aggregated Information**"). We may also anonymize individual User data so that it is no longer personally identifiable ("**De-identified Information**"). Aggregate Information and De-identified Information is no longer Personal Information. We may use and/or share such information in any manner not otherwise prohibited by this Policy or by applicable law, without notice or compensation to you, including freely disclosing for any legal purpose non-Personal Information to VIANT affiliates, advertisers, partners, content owners, and other third parties. We will not reidentify data we maintain as De-identified Information, or authorize others to do so.
    
    We will continue to evaluate and update this Policy as we rollout additional services for our Users, employ new technologies and otherwise adapt and improve along with the evolving online and digital world so we recommend that you check for changes regularly. To the extent that we provide you notice on any of the Myspace Services of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those different or additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.
    
    In addition, please review the Myspace Services' [Terms of Use](https://myspace.com/pages/terms), which governs your use of Myspace Services.
    

5. The Information That We Collect
    1. Information You Provide To Us
        
        **Personal Information That You Provide**
        
        We may ask you to provide us with certain information, including personal information, when you interact with the Myspace Services. Information that identifies you as a particular individual is referred to in this Policy as "**Personal Information**". This would include, without limitation, your full name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. We collect Personal Information through the Myspace Services when you choose to provide us with such information, for example, when you register to become a Member. We may also collect Personal Information through a variety of other methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit Profile Content or otherwise interact with the Myspace Services. The Personal Information you provide includes:
        
        * **Registration Information**
            
            Certain features of the Myspace Services are only accessible by Members who have registered with Myspace and created a Myspace account ("**Account**"). In order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name, e-mail address, date of birth, zip code, and gender (collectively, "**Registration Information**").
            
        * **Profile Content**
            
            When you sign up as a Member, you are required to create one or more Myspace profiles that are associated with your Account (each, a "**Profile**"). Myspace may allow you to populate your Profile with certain content chosen by you, and we may also associate additional content with your Profile based on your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as your video viewing and other related activities (collectively, "**Profile Content**"). Any Profile Content that Myspace allows you to submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our [Terms of Use](https://myspace.com/pages/terms) at all times. Please note that your Profile Content may contain Registration Information. The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Restricted Information and Public Information.
            
            The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Restricted Information and Public Information.
            
        
        "**Restricted Information**" refers to those portions of the Profile Content and Activity Notifications associated with your Profile to which you may elect to restrict public access by changing the Profile settings that Myspace may make available to you from time-to-time [here](https://myspace.com/settings/profile) ("**Profile Settings**") or by changing other functionality specific settings on the Myspace Services. These Profile Settings may permit you to create a "**Restricted Profile**" by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute) limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your Profile that are not required by Myspace to be Public Information (as described below), certain associated Profile Content, and some of the notifications that Myspace produces regarding your activities ("**Activity Notifications**"). Further, unless otherwise provided by Myspace, all of your Profile Content and Activity Notifications will still be available to the people whose Profiles you allow to connect to you.
        
        **"Public Information"** refers to the portion of your Profile Content that can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services (_e.g._, Myspace, other Users, search engines, advertisers, application developers, other third parties, etc.). Any Profile Content that does not otherwise constitute Restricted Information is considered Public Information for the purposes of this Policy. The following information is Public Information that cannot be changed to Restricted Information:
        
        * Full Name
        * Username
        * Profile URL
        * Profile Photo
        * Profile Cover
        * Stated Location
        * Gender
        * Age
        * Myspace IDs
        
        **Public Information also includes:**
        
        * Any additional Profile Content associated with a "**Public Profile**," which refers to any Profile for which a User has set the Profile's visibility status to "Public" in his or her Profile Settings, but subject to Mix privacy settings (as further defined below);
        * Activity Notifications published on the Myspace Services from Public Profiles;
        * Your status as a "Top Fan";
        * Affinity Information (_e.g._, the relative magnitude of your affinity for Profiles and content); and
        * The number of your connections in and connections out.
        
        Please note that the Myspace Services currently do not allow Users to restrict access to the items of Public Information described above, which can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services, including via third party search engines. If that is not acceptable to you, you should not use the Myspace Services.
        
        You should be aware that the default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public (_i.e._, Public Profiles). The default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are under 18 years of age is restricted (_i.e._, Restricted Profiles), other than for Artist Profiles (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://myspace.com/pages/terms)) of Members who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default. Other than with respect to Artist Profiles, whose visibility status may not be changed, you may change the visibility status of your Profile from a Public Profile to a Restricted Profile at any time by visiting [Profile Settings](https://myspace.com/settings/profile). Please note, however, that Activity Notifications that were created during the time that your Profile was a Public Profile shall remain public after any change to a Restricted Profile.
        
        Although access to Restricted Information will be limited as set forth above, it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public. Myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to share your Restricted Information. For example, you may choose to use the Myspace Services to access content pages, which are those pages that, for example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a collection of content such as audio tracks (_e.g._, "Mixes"). When you decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another Member's Profile, a Content Page, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, that information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with the visibility settings for the relevant Profile or content, **even if those settings are inconsistent with your own Profile Settings**. Content Pages are generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those pages will likely be available to anyone. In addition, your video viewing or audio selections may be part of your Profile Content as well as any content pages that you view. Similarly, if you connect to a Public Profile, the fact that you have connected to that Public Profile will be available to anybody with access to the Myspace Services.
        
        The Profile Settings that Myspace makes available to Members, as well as their functionality, may change as the Myspace Services continue to evolve. We will provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the Profile Settings section, or otherwise. Delays and errors in effecting Profile Setting preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate, complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate. If you experience any problems with your Profile Settings, or have any questions or concerns regarding your Profile Settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding the settings options that may be available to you, please contact us at the [Help Site](https://myspace.com/help).
        
        The Myspace Services may allow messaging between Members. More information about who can message whom is available [here](https://help.myspace.com/hc/en-us/articles/202274374-Messaging-on-Myspace-).
        
        More detailed information about Myspace's Profile Settings is available [here](https://myspace.com/settings/profile).
        
        **Account ID And Profile ID**
        
        When you create an Account, Myspace assigns an "**Account ID**" to identify and organize information relating to your Account and a "**Profile ID**" for each Profile associated with an Account (collectively, your "**Myspace IDs**"). The Profile ID may allow Myspace to provide a unique internet URL for your Profile ("**Profile URL**"). As described above, Myspace IDs and/or Profile URLs always constitute Public Information and may therefore be viewed, accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services. You cannot restrict access to Public Information through your Profile Settings, and you cannot make your Myspace IDs and Profile URLs Restricted Information.
        
    2. Information We Collect Or Store As You Access And Use The Myspace Services
        
        In addition to the information that you choose to submit to us via the Myspace Services, we and our affiliate VIANT, as well as our service providers and third parties, may also collect certain information about you automatically, including through the use of various Web Technologies (defined below) that passively store or collect certain information whenever you interact with the Myspace Services. This may include information about the nature of a User's interactions with the Myspace Services, such as their media consumption activities ("**Usage Information**"). Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts,entity tags and other similar technologies whether now or later devised (collectively "**Web Technologies**"), some of which may be downloaded to the computer or other Device. The Usage Information that we collect may be non-identifying or it may be associated with you, your Account, and your Profile(s). In the event we collect certain information about your interaction with the Myspace Services while you are a Visitor, Myspace may associate that information with your Account if you subsequently become a Member.
        
        Examples of the Usage Information we may collect include:
        
        * your IP address or unique Device Identifiers;
        * your Device functionality (_e.g._, browser type, operating system, hardware, mobile network information, _etc_.);
        * the URL that referred you to the Myspace Services;
        * the areas within the Myspace Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences, which artists you are listening to, what videos you are viewing, or Profiles or content pages you choose to connect with, _etc_.;
        * your Device location (including using GPS and longitude and latitude location information);
        * your Device characteristics;
        * certain other Device data (_e.g._, the time of day when the Device is used); and
        * ranking information about you with respect to other Users or content pages that you interact with (_e.g._, Myspace may record the links to content pages that you post and rank your association with that content compared to other Users).
        
        Please note that certain Web Technologies may set, change, alter, or modify settings or configurations on your Device. Additionally, third parties may use Web Technologies with the Myspace Services. For more information on the options that may be available to you for opting out of Web Technologies, see [Section 5](#5.). You can also avoid the Web Technologies used on the Myspace Services by not interacting with the Myspace Services.
        
    3. Information We Receive From Third-Parties
        
        Myspace may receive or collect certain information about you from third-party websites, platforms, or services in the event you choose to take advantage of various features that may allow you to integrate information on or to the Myspace Services. Similarly, we may allow third-party websites, platforms, or services to develop software applications that you can elect to install on your Account in order to provide additional functionality to the Myspace Services. These third party integrations and applications are collectively referred to in this Policy as "**Third-Party Linked Services.**" Should you voluntarily choose to take advantage of the Third-Party Linked Services offered through the Myspace Services, we may receive certain information about you from the relevant third-party providers.
        
        We, and/or our affiliate VIANT, may supplement or otherwise combine the information we collect directly through the Myspace Services with information received or collected from our affiliates or other third parties to deliver targeted advertising to you on other websites across the internet and other platforms, services and networks, including mobile and other connected Device platforms, and for other purposes not prohibited by this Policy.
        
        Myspace will treat any information received from third parties (including providers of Third-Party Linked Services) as set forth in this Policy. However, the information practices of third parties are not governed by this Policy. Myspace cannot control the treatment of your information by third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from those described in this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of service of any such third parties prior to choosing to integrate and/or install them on your Account or disclosing information to them. If you have any questions regarding a third party's information practices, you must contact the relevant entity directly.
        
        If you visit any of our affiliates’ websites or use services provided by our affiliates that are not part of the Myspace Services, please be aware that our affiliates’ privacy policies will apply to their use of your information. Our affiliate VIANT’s Advertising Platform Privacy Policy is available [here](https://s31762.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Viant-Privacy-Policy-Platform-Notice-AMERICAS-1094699153-v27.pdf).
        
    4. Information You Provide About A Third Party
        
        You may have the opportunity to communicate with others from the Myspace Services, such as by sending an invitation to a friend. If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, we may ask you to provide us with certain information about the person with whom you wish to communicate (_e.g._, name, e-mail address, mobile number, etc.). Before you provide that information to us, you must be sure that your friend has given you permission to do that. Myspace collects such information for the purposes of facilitating the requested communication, which may contain a specific promotional message from you (_e.g._, an invitation to register for the Myspace Services). Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Myspace Services, your e-mail address, mobile number, name or username, and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).

    * To law enforcement officials (More information is available in our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://help.myspace.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/206014017/2016_Law_Enforcement_Guide__01-01-2016_.pdf).)
    * In the event we file for bankruptcy, or in connection with certain types of business transactions that result in corporate change.
    * To Provide Activity Notifications To Provide Activity Notifications To Provide Activity Notifications. (For additional information on our video sharing practices, please review the terms of the [Video Privacy Policy](https://myspace.com/pages/videoprivacy), which supplements this Policy.)
    
    As part of the Myspace Services, your Usage Information and Profile Content (including video viewing and audio access) may be shared with other Users. To make your content consumption experience more social and fun, to improve services, to perform analytics, to compare your usage to other Users, to rank your linkages with certain content or Users, and to better make suggestions about other content, we may use any of the information you provide and the information we collect about you and we may share the content of the media that you access on or through the Myspace Services with other Users. We may also share your media access through the Myspace Services (including video viewing and audio content access) as an activity notification by activity notification by, for example, sharing your Profile content (including your full name, username and Profile Picture) on the content page where such video or audio resides. Additionally, your activity may be indicated on your own Profile (in your activity stream or elsewhere) and on your connections' Profile, in each case, both on the Myspace Website, and on any other of the Myspace Services. Other examples of activities that may generate Activity Notifications include, but are not limited to: (i) posting status updates; (ii) commenting on a post; (iii) sharing content or posting on the Myspace Services; (iv) sharing content or posting to a Third-Party Linked Service; (v) connecting to a Profile or content (e.g., a photo, photo album, video, song, etc.); (vi) being tagged in a photo; (vii) commenting on a photo album; (viii) adding a photo to a photo album; (ix) playing a song or watching a video; (x) adding a song to a Mix; (xi) updating a Profile; and (xii) adding a cover photo. An example of an actual Activity Notification on the Myspace Services is the following: "John Doe listened to the song 'True Love Waits'." Activity Notifications may include Profile Content (e.g., your full name and Profile photo), and some may aggregate your activity with activity of third parties (e.g., "John Doe and Sally Smith connected to a photo."). **Myspace makes this feature public to everyone by default, and anyone can see these Activity Notifications**. Note that if your Profile is a Restricted Profile, the Profiles that you have allowed to connect to you will still see your Activity Notifications regarding your content consumption on Myspace. From time-to-time we may offer you with options, such as an option to opt out on a session basis (that is, just for a single time when you are using the Myspace Services), or a persistent basis (that is, for every time that you use the Myspace Services), from Activity Notifications related to your content consumption. Session settings are intended to last only as long as your Myspace page is open in your browser. If you close your browser, the session-based setting will be reset to public, and your song and video play Activity Notifications will default to the visibility setting associated with your Profile's visibility. **You should always check the content consumption Activity Notification setting each time you use the Myspace Services, so that you are aware of and comfortable with your media consumption appearing as Activity Notifications.**
    
    We may use Usage Information (such as about your media consumption, connections to content pages or Profiles, and posts regarding content pages or Profiles), and your Profile Content, to rank affinity to other Profiles and content. This allows us to identify "**Top Fans**", and we may use your Public Information to display that you are a Top Fan of an artist, other Profile, or a piece of content. Top Fan status is Public Information – anyone may see your status as a Top Fan. We also may provide analytics tools to Artist Profiles that allow the owners of such Artist Profiles to see Public Information of Users who strongly engage with the Artist Profile or the content pages controlled by the Artist Profile (e.g., videos or songs or such Artist Profile), including Users that are not connected to the Artist Profile. **Unless otherwise noted, your consumption of media on the Myspace Services will be Public Information.**
    

9. Choices Regarding Third-Party Tracking And Targeting
    
    We will provide a cookie preference tool that you can use to manage cookies associate with the Myspace services available here. You can also manage cookies in your browser’s settings. In addition, many Web Technology providers participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members, visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), and [http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies, including our Affiliate VIANT, also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
    
    We may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other service providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other tracking technologies to help us analyze Members and Visitors and how they use the Myspace Services. Information generated by these analytics services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Myspace Services, compiling statistic reports on the Myspace Services’ activity, and providing other services relating to Myspace Services activity and other Internet usage. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to [href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) under the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of their web sites or tailor their online ads for you.”
    
    You will need to enable opt-outs on each device and browser that you use. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out tools, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
    
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible for, and make no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics service providers and other third-parties, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
    

11. Information For Members And Visitors Located Outside The United States
    
    The Myspace Services are intended for a U.S. audience and are not available to Users residing in some countries. **By providing information to Myspace, you do so in the knowledge that the laws applicable in your home country may not apply to protect your Personal Information or to your use of the Myspace Services. By using the Myspace Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States. If you do not agree to this international transfer of data, then you must refrain from using the Myspace Services.**
    

13. How We Safeguard User Information
    
    Myspace takes reasonable precautions to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information accessed, stored or transmitted by Myspace.
    

15. Protecting Children's Privacy
    
    Myspace understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. We do not use the Myspace Services to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, and do not allow children under sixteen (16) years old to use the Myspace Services. If you are under sixteen (16) years old, you may not create a Myspace User Account and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Myspace Services. In the event that Myspace becomes aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child, we will dispose of that information in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 years old has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/18c06089-a9ec-473c-a6d8-23d20fea46af/c0a95210-090b-4630-98ef-21294d417b29), make a request using a “Parent Concerning Child” request type, and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our systems. California minors have certain rights to have their own posts deleted as more fully explained in our [Enterprise-wide Privacy Notice](https://myspace.com/pages/privacy?page=enterprise#6(a)).
    

17. CCPA Reporting Metrics
    
    California law requires that we provide certain metrics about consumer rights requests received in the previous calendar year. The metrics provided below include requests Myspace has received globally for the 2023 calendar year.
    
    * Requests to Opt Out: 1,771 received, all of which were completed.

19. If There Are Changes To The Policy
    
    Myspace may modify this Policy and/or Profile Setting options at any time. However, if we make material changes to this Policy that expand our rights to use your Personal Information, we will notify you either through a Myspace message, e-mail, and/or a prominent notice at the Myspace Website, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. You express your affirmative consent to any material changes if you choose to continue using the Myspace Services following notice of these changes in this manner. Your participation in and use of the Myspace Services is entirely voluntary, and you may choose to cease using the Myspace Services and/or to terminate your Account and its associated Profile(s) at any time and for any reason.
    

21. Managing Your Information On, And Communications From, Myspace
    
    We provide you with the ability, through your Profile Settings, to access, edit, or delete certain of your Registration Information and Profile Content. To do so, follow the steps outlined [here](https://myspace.com/settings/profile). Please note that certain Registration Information is required to maintain an Account; therefore, if you desire to delete required Registration Information, you will have to delete your Account and associated Profiles. If you no longer want to use the Myspace Services, you may cancel your Account at any time. Even after you cancel your Account or delete information or Profile Content, copies of some information from your Account or Profile(s) may remain viewable in circumstances where, for example, you have posted information on another User's Profile, shared information with a Third-Party Linked Service, or if another Visitor or Member copied, stored or shared your information or has a copy of the link to content you shared on the Myspace Services. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also retain backup information related to your Account and associated Profile(s) on our servers for as long as is reasonably necessary after cancellation for fraud detection, site operation or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Please be aware that, due to the nature of certain internet and mobile technologies outside of our control, such as caching and networked technology, your Account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of your information and content from elsewhere on the internet and from search engines.
    
    If you do not want to receive promotional (i.e., commercial) e-mail from us in the future you may unsubscribe by changing your [Profile Settings](https://myspace.com/settings/profile) or following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the relevant e-mail from Myspace. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain administrative communications relating to your account or use of the Myspace Services, such as service announcements, even if you choose to opt-out from receiving our promotional e-mails.
