### 7.1 SUBSCRIBING TO NEWSLETTER

(1) By giving your consent, you can subscribe to our e-mail newsletter (hereinafter referred to as “Newsletter”), which is sent to inform you about our products, sales and events.

(2) To register for our Newsletter subscription, we use a so-called double-opt-in process. That means that we will send an e-mail to the provided e-mail address after your registration, in which you are asked to confirm that you wish to receive our Newsletter. If you fail to confirm your registration within fourteen days, your information will be deleted automatically. In addition to that, we also store the IP addresses that you used to register and confirm as well as the times of registration and confirmation. The purpose of this process is to verify your registration and, if necessary, resolve any possible misuse of your personal data.

(3) The mandatory information required for sending the Newsletter is only your e-mail address. The provision of other information is voluntary and is used only in order to be able to address you personally. After receiving your confirmation, we save your e-mail address for the purpose of sending you the Newsletter.

(4) The aforementioned procedures during the Newsletter subscription process are legally permitted with your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 (1) a) of GDPR.

(5) Your consent to receiving our Newsletters may be revoked at any time by unsubscribing. You can unsubscribe by clicking on the respective link provided in each Newsletter e-mail or by sending an e-mail to the contact information mentioned above under 1.1 of this Privacy Policy.

(6) The data that you have provided while subscribing to our Newsletter will be deleted when you cancel your subscription.

### 7.2. NEWSLETTER TRACKING

(1) We do point out that we do analyse the behavior of Newsletter recipients. For this analysis, the sent e-mails include so-called web beacons or tracking pixels that represent single-pixel image files. For these analyses we combine data or parts thereof which are mentioned above under 2.1 of this Privacy Policy as well as the web beacons with your e-mail address and an individual ID. Even the links included in the Newsletter have this ID. With the data obtained in this manner, we create a user profile that allows us to tailor the Newsletter in order to better address the interests of our customers. In doing so, we record when you read our Newsletters, the links that you click on and thus deduce your personal interests. We in turn link such data with your actions on our website.

(2) The above tracking is legally permitted with the consent that you have given in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 (1) a) of GDPR, provided that you have subscribed to our Newsletter.

(3)You can object to the aforementioned tracking at any time by clicking on the respective unsubscribe link provided in each Newsletter e-mail or by sending an e-mail to the contact information mentioned above under 1.1 of this Privacy Policy. The information obtained through tracking will be stored until you have unsubscribed from the Newsletter. After unsubscribing we store the data anonymously purely for statistical purposes.

(4) Tracking is moreover not possible if you have by default turned off the display of images in your e-mail client. In such case, you will not be able to see the Newsletter in its entirety and you may not be able to use all features of the Newsletter. Manually unblocking the display of images activates the above-described tracking.

### 7.3. NEWSLETTER SERVICE PROVIDER

### 12.1 GOOGLE ANALYTICS

(1) This website uses Google Analytics, an online analytical service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics implements cookies, i.e. text files, which are saved on your computer, and which allow for analyzing your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie based on your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. If the IP anonymisation function is enabled on this website, your IP address will be abbreviated by Google beforehand within the member states of the European Union or other signatory states of European Economic Area Treaty. A full IP address is only sent in exceptional cases to a Google server in the US and truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website in order to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports about website activities and offer the website operator other services linked with website use and Internet use.

(2) The IP address sent by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not compiled by Google with other data.

(3) You may prevent the storage of cookies by implementing the corresponding settings in your browser; please note however that you may not be able to fully utilise all the functions of this website. In addition to that, you can prevent Google from collecting data generated by the cookie and associated with your use of the website (including your IP address) and Google’s processing of such data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in provided by Google: [Analytics opt-out](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh "Analytics opt-out free plugin")

(1) Our website makes use of so-called social plug-ins (“Plug-ins”) from Instagram, which is operated by Instagram LLC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (“Instagram”).

(2) When you open a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser sets up a direct connection to the Instagram servers. The contents of the plug-in are sent from Instagram directly to your browser and incorporated in the web page. As a result of this integration, Instagram receives information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have an Instagram profile or are not currently logged into Instagram. This information (including your IP address) is sent by your browser directly to an Instagram server in the US and stored there. If you are logged into Instagram, Instagram is able to directly assign your visit to our website to your Instagram account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for instance actuating an Instagram button, this information is also directly sent to an Instagram server and stored there. The information is also posted to your Instagram account and shown to your contacts there.

(3) For information about the purpose and scope of data collection practices and further processing and use of such data by Instagram and your rights in this regard and the options available to protect your privacy, consult Instagram’s privacy policy. [https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388/](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388/ "Instagram Privacy Policy") If you do not want Instagram to assign data collected through our website directly to your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram prior to visiting our website. You can also prevent the loading of Instagram plug-ins by installing add-ons for your browser, e.g. the script blocker “NoScript” [http://noscript.net/](https://paris-elysees.com/homepage/legal-notice/privacy-policy/Block%20external%20scripts%20with%20NoScript "http://noscript.net/") .

If you would prefer the use not to be associated with your YouTube profile, you need to log out prior to actuating the button. YouTube stores the data collected about you as usage profiles and utilises such data for advertising purposes, market research and/or to tailor its website to address requirements. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users not signed in) to provide requests-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You are entitled to object to the creation of such user profiles, whereas you have to contact YouTube in order to assert your objection.
