1.2 You may use the Web Store to browse, locate and download Products (defined as software, content and digital materials created for use in connection with Google Chrome and distributed via the Web Store) for use in connection with Google Chrome. Some of these Products may be offered by Google while others may be made available by third parties not affiliated with Google. You agree that Google is not responsible for any Product on the Web Store that originates from a source other than Google.

1.3 You accept the Terms by either (1) clicking to agree or accept where these options are presented to you, or (2) actually using the Web Store application or web service.

1.4 In order to use the Web Store you must be 13 years of age or older. If you are between 13 and 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Web Store.

2\. Google’s provision of Web Store

2.3 Support for the use and operation of the Web Store (including how to find, download and remove Products) is provided by Google in the user interface of the Web Store application. Google does not provide customer support for Products distributed by developers on the Web Store. Each developer is responsible for determining the level of customer support that they provide, and you should contact them directly.

3\. Your use of Web Store
-------------------------

3.1 In order to access certain services in the Web Store, you may be required to provide information about yourself such as your name, email address, Google Account information, address and billing details. You agree that any such information that you provide to Google will always be accurate, correct and up to date.

3.2 You agree to use the Web Store only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions. You agree to comply with all applicable export controls, including, but not limited to, the United States Department of Commerce's Export Administration Regulations and sanctions programmes administered by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. By using the Web Store, you represent and warrant that you are not prohibited from receiving exports or services under US or other applicable export laws. You agree to comply with all local laws and regulations regarding the download, installation and/or use of the Products.

3.3 You agree not to access (or attempt to access) the Web Store by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Google, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Google. You specifically agree not to access (or attempt to access) the Web Store through any automated means (including use of scripts, crawlers or similar technologies) and shall ensure that you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the Web Store website.

3.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with, or disrupts the Web Store (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Web Store). You agree that you will not use any of the Products found on the Web Store in a way that interferes or disrupts any servers, networks or websites operated by Google or any third party.

3.5 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Google, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Web Store for any purpose. You agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell any Product from the Web Store for any purpose, unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with the developer of such Product.

3.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) your use of the Web Store and any Products, any breach of your obligations under the Terms, and for the consequences (including loss or damage of any kind which Google may suffer) of any such breach.

3.7 You agree that Google and/or third parties own all right, title and interest in and to the Web Store and the Products available through the Web Store, including without limitation all applicable Intellectual Property Rights in the Products. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights existing under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, unfair competition law and any and all other proprietary rights world wide. You agree that you will not, and will not allow any third party to: (i) copy, sell, license, distribute, transfer, modify, adapt, translate, prepare derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Products, unless otherwise permitted; (ii) take any action to circumvent or defeat the security or content usage rules provided, deployed or enforced by any functionality (including, without limitation, digital rights management or forward-lock functionality) in the Products; (iii) use the Products to access, copy, transfer, transcode or retransmit content in violation of any law or third-party rights, or (iv) remove, obscure or alter Google's or any third-party's copyright notices, trademarks or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within the Products.

3.8 Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Products from the Web Store. However, you agree that by using the Web Store you may be exposed to Products that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that you use the Web Store at your own risk.

3.9 Returns: You have 30 minutes from the time of purchase (not download) to return any Products purchased from the Web Store for a full refund of any applicable fees. You may only return a given Product once; if you subsequently purchase the same Product again, you may not return it a second time. Where the option to return a Product is available, it will be made available to you through the Web Store user interface.

3.10 Chargeback and billing disputes: Google is not responsible for billing disputes arising from purchases on the Web Store. All billing problems should be directed to the developer in question, the payment processor or your credit card company, as appropriate.

3.11 User reviews: Chrome Web Store's policies for ratings and reviews are below. Reviews that don't follow these policies will be removed, and anyone who repeatedly or egregiously violates them may lose the ability to post reviews on the Chrome Web Store.

3.11.a Spam and fake reviews: Your reviews should reflect the experience that you've had with the content or service that you're reviewing. Do not post fake or inaccurate reviews, the same review multiple times, reviews for the same content from multiple accounts, reviews to mislead other users or manipulate the rating, or reviews on behalf of others. Do not misrepresent your identity or your affiliation to the content that you're reviewing.

3.11.b Off-topic reviews: Keep reviews on-topic and relevant to the content, service or experience that you're reviewing. Don't post solicitations, political or social commentary, or anything else that is irrelevant to the content, service or experience that you're reviewing.

3.11.c Advertising: We want reviews to be useful, and they aren't useful if they're promoting something other than the content or service that you're reviewing. Don't post promotional or commercial content for any product or services, including affiliate or referral-based promotions. Don't post phone numbers, email addresses or links to other websites.

3.11.d Conflict of interest: Reviewers are most valuable when they're genuine and unbiased. They should be written by people who aren't motivated by financial gain. Don't offer or accept money, products or services in exchange for posting reviews. Don't review content, services or experiences if you own or work for the business that created it.
