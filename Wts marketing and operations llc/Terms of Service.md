WTS Marketing and Operations LLC Terms \*

OVERVIEW This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which Affiliate will act as an independent contractor sales representative for Seller, if and only if expressly accepted and executed by Seller (i.e., if and only if there is an Effective Date, as defined below). Affiliate’s initial execution and submission of the Agreement to Seller must include an accurate and completed Affiliate Information Sheet (attached at Exhibit A). IT IS AFFILIATE’S RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL TIMES TO UPDATE AND ENSURE THE CURRENCY OF THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THE AFFILIATE INFORMATION SHEET. DEFINITIONS “Affiliate Media” means electronic marketing materials owned, used, or administered by Affiliate or any Sub-Affiliate of Affiliate and used to market, promote, or sell Seller’s Products, including, but not limited to, websites owned or controlled by Affiliate, commercial e-mails sent by Affiliate, and online advertisements owned or placed by Affiliate. “Affiliate Program” means the relationships, rights, and duties between and among (1) Seller and Affiliate; and (2) Affiliate and its Sub-Affiliates, pursuant to which Seller’s Products are marketed. “Affiliate” means the person or entity so identified above, who/which, by executing this Agreement, is applying to become an independent contractor marketing affiliate of Seller. “Agreement” means this Affiliate Marketing Agreement. “Earned Payout” means, pursuant to sales commission terms agreed upon in a separate document between Affiliate and Seller, the amount that, at any given time and without reference to any setoff, recoupment, or withholding to which Seller may otherwise be entitled hereunder, has been earned by Affiliate. “Effective Date” shall mean that date upon which Seller approves and executes this Agreement after its execution and submission by Affiliate. Until and unless Seller does so approve and execute this Agreement, this document represents an offer to participate by Affiliate and is not a binding or enforceable contract. “Products” means those goods and services that Seller may, from time to time, make available for advertisement by Affiliate in strict accordance with this Agreement. “Program Website Links” mean graphic and textual hyperlinks supplied to Affiliate by Seller so that Affiliate may display and include those hyperlinks in the Affiliate Media. These hyperlinks identify Affiliate as a member of Seller’s Affiliate Program and provide the means by which an interested recipient can click-through to the Program Website. These hyperlinks will include a unique identifier identifying Affiliate as the sender of the pertinent Affiliate Media. “Program Website” means the Seller website or webpage promoted by Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and at which customers may purchase Seller’s Products. “Seller” means the person or entity so identified above. “Sub-Affiliates” means Affiliate’s independent subcontractor sub-affiliates, independent contractor sub-sub affiliates, etc. (i.e., all sub-affiliates regardless of subcontractor tier). I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 1. Appointment and Scope: Nonexclusive Independent Sales Representative for Retail Sales Affiliate is hereby approved as a nonexclusive independent sales representative for Seller’s Products. Affiliate hereby accepts such appointment and warrants and represents that Affiliate’s sales-related efforts shall be carried out only in STRICT COMPLIANCE with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Pursuant to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Affiliate is authorized to market and sell Seller’s Products to retail customers. Affiliate has no right to sell Seller’s Products at wholesale or otherwise for resale, and shall use Affiliate’s best efforts to prevent Affiliate’s customers from engaging in wholesale or resale activity. Affiliate acknowledges that Seller may, without limitation, authorize other independent sales representatives to market the same Products in direct competition with Affiliate. Seller reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel, change, alter, or limit the scope of Affiliate’s appointment and/or the Products to be sold by Affiliate at any time upon written notice to Affiliate. 2. Affiliate Duties and Seller Rights a. Strict Compliance with All Terms of Agreement and All Laws, Regulations, and Rules Affiliate shall perform all duties and obligations required or permitted hereunder in STRICT COMPLIANCE with this Agreement (including, but not limited to, Exhibit B) and with all federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, and the like. b. Solely Responsible for Affiliate Media Content Affiliate will have sole responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of, and all content on or linked to, Affiliate’s Media. c. Absolute Liability for Acts and/or Omissions of Sub-Affiliates Affiliate shall be and is ABSOLUTELY LIABLE for all acts and omissions of Affiliate’s Sub-Affiliates exactly as would be had Affiliate itself carried out the acts and omissions. d. Compliance with Pre-Mailing Approval Rights of Seller From time to time, Seller may request – prior to Affiliate’s transmission or publication of Affiliate Media containing links to the Program Website or otherwise relating in any way to the Affiliate Program – that Affiliate submit the final version of Affiliate’s proposed Affiliate Media to Seller for Seller’s approval prior to such transmission or publication. Affiliate acknowledges, however, that it is solely Affiliate’s obligation to ensure that all Affiliate Media complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, and applicable third-party policies. e. Seller’s Right to Disclose Affiliate Identities; Affiliate Duty to Disclose Sub-Affiliate Identities In the event of a material breach of this Agreement, Seller reserves the right to disclose Affiliate’s identity and contact information to appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities and/or to any third party that has been or claims to have been directly damaged by Affiliate’s actions. Affiliate warrants and represents that, upon request by Seller, Affiliate will provide all information in its possession, custody, and/or control regarding any Sub-Affiliate or Sub-Affiliate marketing campaign. 3. Seller Duties and Affiliate Rights a. Content and Information Supplied by Seller Seller shall supply Affiliate with information regarding the Products and Program Website; appropriate links to the Program Website to be included in the Affiliate Media; and, at Seller’s option, additional content and/or graphics for inclusion in the Affiliate Media. b. Intellectual Property Seller grants Affiliate a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable right to use the content and information supplied by Seller and to access Seller’s web site through the links provided by Seller for the sole purpose of identifying Affiliate’s Media as a participant in the Affiliate Program and assisting in increasing sales through the Program Web Site. Affiliate may not alter, modify, manipulate, or create derivative works of Seller-provided links and content or of any Seller graphics, creative, copy, or other materials owned by or licensed by Seller in any way. Affiliate is only entitled to use Seller-provided content to the extent that Affiliate is a member in good standing of Seller’s Affiliate Program. Seller may revoke Affiliate’s license at any time in Seller’s sole discretion by giving Affiliate written notice. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant Affiliate any rights to any of Seller's trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, or trade secrets. Affiliate agrees that Seller may use any suggestion, comment, or recommendation by Affiliate without compensation to Affiliate. All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Seller. 4. Relationship of Parties The parties expressly intend and agree that Affiliate is acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee of Seller. Affiliate retains sole and absolute discretion, control, and judgment in the manner and means of carrying out Affiliate’s selling and marketing activities, except as set forth herein (including the requirement that all sales-related campaigns and e-mails comply with all pertinent laws, rules, and regulations). Affiliate understands and agrees that Seller will not pay or withhold from the compensation paid to Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement any sums customarily paid or withheld for or on behalf of employees for income tax, employment insurance, social security, worker’s compensation, or any other withholding tax, insurance, or payment pursuant to any law or governmental requirement, and all such payments as may be required by law are Affiliate’s sole responsibility. Affiliate agrees to hold Seller harmless against and indemnify Seller for any such payments or liabilities for which Seller may become liable with respect to such matters. This Agreement shall not be construed as a partnership agreement, and Seller shall have no responsibility for any of Affiliate’s debts, liabilities, or other obligations, or for Affiliate’s (or Affiliate’s employees’) intentional, reckless, or negligent acts or omissions. 5. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue thereafter until terminated as provided herein. Affiliate may terminate Affiliate’s participation in the Affiliate Program at any time. Seller may terminate Affiliate’s and/or any SubAffiliate’s participation in Seller’s offers and/or terminate this Agreement in its entirety at any time and for any reason which Seller deems appropriate, effective immediately upon written notice to Affiliate. Upon termination of Affiliate’s participation in one or more offers or this Agreement for any reason, Affiliate will immediately cease all use of Seller’s content and intellectual property and will cease representing itself as a Seller affiliate. All rights to validly accrued payments, causes of action, and any provisions, which by their terms are intended to survive termination, shall survive any termination. 6. Affiliate’s Indemnification Obligations Affiliate shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, and their respective directors, officers, employees, owners, and agents harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, injuries, costs, expenses, causes of action, claims, demands, assessments, and similar matters, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees and costs resulting from or arising out of: (i) Affiliate’s alleged and/or actual failure to fully and completely conform and comply with each and all of Affiliate’s covenants, agreements, terms, and conditions under this Agreement, (ii) Affiliate’s alleged and/or actual violation of any law, rule, or regulation applicable to the sale of Products, or (iii) Affiliate’s alleged and/or actual negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct in the conduct of Affiliate’s duties and obligations under this Agreement. 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM AND LINKS, AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, ARE PROVIDED TO AFFILIATE "AS IS." EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. SELLER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM OR LINKS WILL MEET AFFILIATE'S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM OR LINKS WILL BE COMPLETELY ERROR- FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF A CLIENT OR THEIR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. SELLER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT AFFILIATE WILL EARN ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF COMMISSIONS. 8. LIMITATION OF SELLER LIABILITY IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAVAILABILITY OR INOPERABILITY OF SELLER CONTENT OR LINKS, PROGRAM WEB SITES, TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION, COMPUTER ERROR, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF INFORMATION, OR OTHER INJURY, DAMAGE, OR DISRUPTION OF ANY KIND BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF SELLER. IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PERSONAL INJURY / WRONGFUL DEATH, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT SELLER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. SELLER'S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO AFFILIATE, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL BE LIMITED TO AND SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID TO AFFILIATE BY SELLER IN COMMISSIONS DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO SUCH CLAIM. II. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS 1. Severability In the event that one or more of the words, phrases, sentences, clauses, sections, subdivisions, or subparagraphs contained herein shall be held invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid portion had not been inserted. In the event that any invalid language is severed under this paragraph, the severed language shall be comprised of the smallest unit possible such that the severance of the unit results in a valid provision (i.e., a single item in a list will be severed rather than the entire list, a clause will be severed rather than the entire sentence, etc.). Furthermore, if such invalidity shall be caused by the length of any period of time, the number or location of clients, the size of any area, or the description of the duties of Affiliate set forth in any part hereof, such period of time, number or location of clients, area, or description of duties, or any combination thereof, shall be considered to be reduced to a period, number, location, area, or description which would cure such invalidity. 2. Amendments; Modifications by Seller No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding upon Seller unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Seller, or upon Affiliate. In addition to any notice permitted to be given under this Agreement, Seller may modify any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time by providing Affiliate with a notification by e-mail. The changes will become effective ten (10) business days after such notice. If the modifications are unacceptable to Affiliate, Affiliate may terminate this Agreement without penalty solely on the account of such termination within a ten (10) business-day period. Affiliate’s continued participation in this Affiliate Program ten (10) business days after a change notice has been posted will constitute Affiliate’s acceptance of such change. In addition, Seller may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of an offer or link or remove, alter, or modify any tags, text, graphics, or banner ads in connection with a link. Affiliate agrees to promptly implement any request from Seller to remove, alter, or modify any link, graphic, or banner ad that is being used by Affiliate as part of the Affiliate Program. 3. Assignment This Agreement is a personal services agreement, in which Seller is contracting with Affiliate solely for the skills and performance of Affiliate. This Agreement may not be assigned by Affiliate. This Agreement may be assigned by Seller to any Affiliate of Seller without the consent of Affiliate. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon Affiliate's heirs and legal representatives. Should Seller assign this Agreement, the effect of such assignment shall be a novation (i.e., the assumption of all rights and responsibilities of Seller by the assignee and the complete and total release of Seller by Affiliate in relation to such rights and responsibilities). 4. Entire Agreement This Agreement sets forth and contains the entire agreement with regard to the matters set forth herein between Affiliate and Seller. There are no promises, terms, conditions, or obligations other than those contained herein. This Agreement supersedes all previous communications, representations, or agreements, either verbal or written, between and among the parties. 5. Choice of Law This Agreement, and any disputes arising from, relating to, or touching upon the Agreement and/or the subject-matter hereof, shall be construed under and governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. 6. Venue and Personal Jurisdiction Any action at law, suit in equity, or other judicial proceeding concerning, relating to, or touching upon in any way this Agreement or the subject-matter hereof, shall be brought, if at all, only in a court of proper jurisdiction in or including Kent County, Delaware. All parties to this Agreement acknowledge the right of the specified court to assert personal jurisdiction in any such action over the parties to this Agreement and waive and release now and forever any defense to that assertion of jurisdiction that might otherwise exist. 7. Preparation of Agreement This Agreement has been drafted and prepared by the combined efforts and input of the Parties hereto. Accordingly, should any term or provision hereof be found or alleged to be ambiguous, no construction of that term or provision against any particular prty as “draftsman” shall arise or occur. 8. Headings for Convenience Only The headings used herein are for convenience only. The headings do not purport to define, limit, or extend the scope or intent of the language of the sections and the paragraphs to which they pertain. 9. Confidentiality Unless: (a) this Agreement is the subject matter of a bona fide dispute between the parties or their successors; and/or (b) disclosure of the terms of this Agreement is necessary to the defense of claims asserted by third parties; and/or (c) disclosure is required under the law; and/or (d) disclosure to auditors, accountants, or financial advisors is required for tax or financial purposes (in which case, Affiliate must take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the existence and terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, requiring and causing the person or entity to whom the information is disclosed to adopt and approve a vow of confidentiality substantially similar to that set forth above), Affiliate agrees that Affiliate will not, during his employment with Seller and for a period of fifteen (15) years thereafter, directly or indirectly disclose to any other person, firm, corporation, association, or organization (including, but not limited to, other Seller employees or contractors, in relation to whom the corresponding agreements may differ from Affiliate’s Agreement on the basis of individualized negotiations) any information regarding the terms of this Agreement or the performance of the duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the terms of this Agreement, business and financial information, customer and vendor lists, and pricing and sales information concerning Seller or its Affiliate Program. All such information shall remain strictly confidential and secret and shall not be utilized, directly or indirectly, by Affiliate for any purpose other than Affiliate’s participation in the Affiliate Program, except and solely to the extent that any such information is generally known or available to the public through a source other than Affiliate. Affiliate shall not use any information obtained from the Affiliate Program to develop, enhance, or operate a service that competes with the Affiliate Program, or assist another party to do the same. 10. Waiver The waiver by one party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision by the other party. The failure of a party at any time to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same. 11. Notices a.
