HEALTHY GAMER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY, FITNESS, LAWFULNESS, OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT ON ITS SERVICES.  
  
EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, THE TERMS REQUIRE YOU AND HEALTHY GAMER TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES ARISING FROM, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND ACCESS TO THE CONTENT WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 20 AND 21 BELOW.

If you do not agree to the Terms, do not use the Services or access any Content.  
    ‍

2. Healthy Gamer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify these Terms at any time and without prior notice. It is your responsibility to check from time to time this website for updates. The date of the last modification will be posted at the beginning of the Terms. By continuing to access or use the Services or Content, you agree to be bound by any modified Terms.  
    ‍

3. **Privacy Policy.** Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.healthygamer.gg/privacy-policy) discusses how we collect, process, and disclose personal information through these Services. Please read that policy carefully. By using the Services or accessing the Content, you consent to granting Healthy Gamer the right to record your interaction with the Services or Content, including in one-on-one sessions, group sessions, lessons, and other digital or interactive talks.  
    ‍

4. **Service Options.**  You can find a description of our Service options [**here**](https://www.healthygamer.gg/about/coaching#pricing), which will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Healthy Gamer account.  Certain options are provided to you free of charge.  The Services that do not require payment are currently referred to as the “Free Services”.  Some other options require payment before you can access them (“Paid Subscriptions”).  
    ‍  
    

5. **Payments, Renewals and Cancellations.  
      
    **a) You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Healthy Gamer or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Service and Content for a specific finite time period ("Pre-Paid Period").  
      
    b) Healthy Gamer may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), from time to time upon notice to you.  Such notice will explain how you can accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.  
      
    c) Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Healthy Gamer or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by contacting the appropriate Administrators if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Healthy Gamer, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.
