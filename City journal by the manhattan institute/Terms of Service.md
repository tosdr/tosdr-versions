Certain features of the Services may permit you or other users to upload content to the Services, including images, data, text, videos, and other types of information (“**User Content**”) and to publish User Content on the Services.  You retain the copyrights, including any moral rights, and any other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you post to the Services.

1. Limited License Grant to Manhattan Institute.  By uploading User Content to the Services, you grant Manhattan Institute a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, transferable right and license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, for any purpose, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter developed.  You irrevocably and forever waive any rights you may have regarding your User Content being altered in any way that may be objectionable to you.  If your name, image, voice, or likeness (your “**Appearance**”) appears in the User Content, you authorize Manhattan Institute to use your Appearance in connection with both non-commercial and commercial uses of the User Content and waive all rights of publicity with respect to such uses of your Appearance. You hereby release Manhattan Institute and its agents and assigns from any and all claims which arise out of or are in any way connected with such use. Manhattan Institute reserves the right to refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any of your User Content in its sole discretion.
2. User Content Representations and Warranties.  You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing User Content.  By posting or publishing User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:  
    • you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Manhattan Institute to exercise the licenses to the User Content granted by you in this section, in the manner contemplated by Manhattan Institute, the Services, and these Terms; and • your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Manhattan Institute to violate any law or regulation. • You agree to pay for any and all royalties, fees, or other monies owing any person by reason of User Content you post on or through the Services.
3. User Content Disclaimer.  We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content.  Manhattan Institute may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable.  You understand that when using the Services you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.  To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, you agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Manhattan Institute with respect to User Content.  We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Content, to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law.  If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice.
4. Procedure for Infringing User Content.  If you believe that any User Content does not conform to these Terms, please notify us.

We comply with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) applicable to our operations (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended).  If you have an intellectual property rights-related complaint about material posted on the Services, you may contact our designated agent at the following address:

Manhattan Institute  
ATTN: Legal Department (Copyright Notification)  
52 Vanderbilt Ave, New York, NY, 10017  
212-599-7000  
dmca@manhattan-institute.org

Please note that under applicable law, if you knowingly give false, misleading or inaccurate information that User Consent is infringing, you may be subject to civil or criminal penalty.

Any notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) alleging that materials hosted by or distributed through the Services infringe intellectual property rights must include all of the information required by the DMCA for such notices.  Manhattan Institute will promptly terminate without notice access to the Services by users that are determined by Manhattan Institute to be “**Repeat Infringers**.”  A Repeat Infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity or has had User Content removed from the Services at least three times.

**9) Arbitration**.

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.  BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.**

In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Manhattan Institute and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of the Services or these Terms (“Dispute”) will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:

1. Notice of Dispute.  In the event of a Dispute, you or Manhattan Institute must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a “Notice of Dispute”).  You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class U.S. Mail to Manhattan Institute at 52 Vanderbilt Ave, New York, NY, 10017 and also via e-mail to dmca@manhattan-institute.org.  Manhattan Institute will send any Notice of Dispute to you by first class U.S. Mail to your address if Manhattan Institute has it, or otherwise to your e-mail address.  You and Manhattan Institute will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.  After sixty (60) days, you or Manhattan Institute may commence arbitration.
2. Mediation, Binding Arbitration and Governing Law.  You and Manhattan Institute shall endeavor to settle any Dispute by mediation under the Mediation Rules of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”).  The place of mediation shall be New York, New York.  Any Dispute which has not been resolved by mediation as provided herein within thirty (30) days after appointment of a mediator or such time period as you or Manhattan Institute may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 9).  You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.  Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.  The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York.  Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.  As the Services are provided in New York, to the fullest extent permitted by law, your access to and use of the Services, the Terms and any Dispute that might arise between you and Manhattan Institute shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
3. Class Action Waiver.  Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.  Neither you nor Manhattan Institute will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.  No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
4. Arbitration Procedures.  Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”) in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.  You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules.  In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.  To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Manhattan Institute and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules.  The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
5. Arbitration Fees. Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee.  If Manhattan Institute files, then Manhattan Institute will pay; if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.  Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.
6. Filing Period.  To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding.  The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur.  If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

**10) Termination.**

The term of these Terms will commence on the date of your first use of the Services and continue until the earliest of: (i) the date upon which Manhattan Institute, in its sole discretion, provides notice to you of termination of these Terms or your access to the Services is terminated (which may occur for any reason); and (ii) your violation or breach of any provisions of these Terms (the “Term”).  Upon expiration or termination of these Terms, the rights granted to you under these Terms with respect to the Services and Service Content will immediately terminate.  However, Manhattan Institute’s rights to use your Feedback, as well as the limitations on Manhattan Institute’s liability, the indemnification provisions, and the terms pertaining to the dispute resolution process, will survive any expiration or termination of these Terms.

**11) Miscellaneous**.

1. Supplemental Terms.  When using the Services, you agree to comply with and are subject to any posted guidelines, rules, or supplemental terms applicable to such services or features, as may be posted from time to time.  All such guidelines, rules, or terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms.  To the extent that you are asked to review and accept any supplemental terms that expressly conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms associated with the applicable portion of the Services govern with respect to your use of such portion of the Services to the extent of the conflict.
2. No Assignment.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Manhattan Institute without restriction.  These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
3. Severability.  If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
4. No Waiver.  Manhattan Institute’s failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive Manhattan Institute’s right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations.  Nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of Manhattan Institute’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by Manhattan Institute with respect to such uses.
5. Governing Law.  These Terms shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the State of California.  By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories, or jurisdictions.
6. Contact.  For inquiries or questions regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact Manhattan Institute at 52 Vanderbilt Ave, New York, NY, 10017, 212-599-7000, or info@manhattan-institute.org.
