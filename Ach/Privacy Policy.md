In certain circumstances, when you have provided your consent which can be withdrawn at any time.  
Where we rely on our legitimate business interests or those legitimate interests of a third party to justify the purposes for using your personal information, this will include:

* pursuit of our commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party;
* compliance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations and any codes of conduct;
* improvement and development of our business operations and service offering, or those of a third party; or
* protection of our business, shareholders, employees and customers, or those of a third party.

##### **WHEN WE SHARE AND WHO CAN ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

Unless you have opted out of having your badge scanned for lead retrieval at an event, we may share your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Notice with:

* a member of our group;
* registered event attendees, sponsors, and exhibitors, if you are an attendee, speaker, sponsor or exhibitor of a Nacha-sponsored event; 
* Nacha webinar partners if you are attending a webinar and have opted-in to having your information provided to the Host;
* partners, suppliers and sub-contractors, for the performance of Nacha’s obligations arising from your membership in Nacha or one of its groups, participation in a Nacha event, or any other contract we enter into with you or to provide you with the information, products and membership services that you request from us;

##### **SELLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We will never sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties. We do provide the contact information for in-person and virtual event attendees to exhibitors and sponsors at Nacha’s in-person and virtual events; however, in-person and virtual events attendees have the option of opting out of this distribution of their contact information.

##### **SECURITY**

Our policies and procedures limit access to your personal information to those with a business reason to know such information.  
Your privacy is very important to Nacha and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alterations. We will use reasonable organizational, physical, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contact” on our Site or contacting us at [dataprotection@nacha.org](mailto:dataprotection@nacha.org).

Access to your nonpublic personally identifiable financial information is limited, through password protection devices and physical safeguards, to authorized employees as necessary to perform the requested transaction. We reveal only partial digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of your browser or any communication transmitted or accessible over the Internet. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

##### **TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF THE EU/EEA AND INTERNATIONAL USERS**

We are headquartered in the United States. Your Personal Data may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to our affiliates, partners, merchants, or service providers who are located worldwide. If you are visiting our Site from outside the United States, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located, and our central database is operated. The United States has not received an “adequacy decision” from the European Commission, which means that the data protection laws of the United States may not offer the same protections as the country in which you reside when you provide information to us. If we transfer personal information outside the EU/EEA, we will implement appropriate and suitable safeguards to protect such data as required by applicable data protection law.

##### **HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you with access to our Site, or as required by law. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you service, you may contact us by using the **[Contact](https://www.nacha.org/contact)** section on our Site or contacting us at [dataprotection@nacha.org](mailto:dataprotection@nacha.org).

##### **WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

The Personal Data that you provide to us is generally stored in the United States. If you are located in another jurisdiction, you should be aware that once your Personal Data is submitted through our Site, it will be transferred to our servers in the United States. For more information, see “Transfer of Personal Data Outside the EU/EEA and International Users” above.

##### **DO-NOt-track disclosure; third-party tracking**

Certain mechanisms may allow you to send web browser signals, known as “Do Not Track” signals, indicating your choice to disable tracking on the Site. There is no industry standard for how Do Not Track consumer browser settings should work on commercial websites. Due to the lack of such standards our websites do not respond to browser do not track signals at this time.  

Third parties, other than our service providers (such as our Site analytics provider), do not have our permission to track which Site you visited prior to and after visiting the Site. That said, we cannot control third-party tracking and there may be some third-party tracking that occurs without our knowledge or consent.

We use Site Improve and Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies and other similar technologies, to collect information about use of the Services anonymously and report website trends, without identifying individual visitors. To learn more, including how to opt out, visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Occasionally, you may encounter banner advertisements for our products and services on third-party websites. We use third-party advertising service providers to distribute our advertisements on websites where we have paid to advertise. These advertisements may use tracking technologies to capture information such as IP address, browser type and usage information in order to track the effectiveness of our advertising efforts. Such tracking technologies do not capture personal information about you, and our advertising service providers are prohibited from using any information collected except to track advertising effectiveness.

##### **CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you are not 13 years or older, do not use our Site. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If we learn that Personal Data of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected through our Site, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child or a minor under the age of 13 has posted, submitted or otherwise communicated Personal Data to our Site without your consent, then you may alert us at [dataprotection@nacha.org](mailto:dataprotection@nacha.org) so that we may take appropriate action to remove the minor's Personal Data from our systems.

##### **YOUR RIGHTS**

**Correction and removal**  
If any of the information that we have about you is incorrect, or you wish to have information (including Personal Data) removed from our records, you may do so by visiting Nacha.org**,** or contacting us at [dataprotection@nacha.org](mailto:dataprotection@nacha.org). Please note that we may not be able to update or correct your personal information previously provided to us by third parties.

**Opting Out**  
As mentioned above, we may use your Personal Data to contact and correspond with you and to respond to your inquiries. If you prefer not to receive marketing messages from us, please let us know by clicking on the unsubscribe link within any marketing message that you receive, by visiting your Nacha email preferences page available through your user profile, or by sending a message to us at [dataprotection@nacha.org](mailto:dataprotection@nacha.org).

##### Combatting Unethical Behavior

Nacha encourages the prompt reporting of all perceived incidents of unethical behavior by its employees or representatives so that immediate action can be taken, if appropriate. Individuals who believe they have been the victim by Nacha or any of its representatives should confidentially submit an email to [EthicsHotline@nacha.org](mailto:EthicsHotline@nacha.org).

Any reported allegations will be investigated promptly. 

Nacha will maintain confidentiality to the extent consistent with appropriate investigation and corrective action.

**RETALIATION**

Retaliation against an individual for reporting unethical behavior is a serious violation and is strictly prohibited. Acts of retaliation should be reported immediately and will be promptly addressed.

We reserve the right to modify this Notice at any time. Any changes we make to this Notice in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notification sent to you by email. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to this Notice.
