Privacy Policy[ArenaSports Manager](https://www.arenasports.net/author/manager/ "Posts by ArenaSports Manager")2024-03-04T15:59:36-08:00

### **Refund Policy**

_Last updated on May 2023_

**Classes and Camps**

Arena Sports will gladly refund customers for any remaining classes and camps that they have not taken within the session, provided the events have _not_ passed on the calendar before the request has been sent. Any Camp refund requests must be received a week in advance of the registered day. All refund requests must be made in the form of an email to the facility or program personnel. In the event that a customer is unable to attend a class, they are required to inform Arena Sports. We will invite them to take a makeup class on another day, date, or time based on availability. Please note that makeup classes are not guaranteed. All makeup classes must be done during the season the missed class was scheduled in. Also, we will not grant any refunds “after the fact” of a no-show.

**Leagues and Teams**

After the customer pays their league fee, they are committed to the team/league and no refund will be granted except in the case of individual free agent players where a team is not found for the player by Arena Sports management.  The no refund policy includes games missed for any reason, including suspensions due to poor conduct within our facility and forfeited teams. Refunds are permitted only if the player finds a replacement that is acceptable to their teammates and team manager. The new player is required to make payment before any refund will be processed for the player leaving. Arena Sports will assist in the exchange while communicating with the players.

**All Other Transactions**

All other purchases, including but not limited to, pro-shop items, concession, food and drink, passes, family entertainment center attractions, and promotional sales are final and non-refundable.

### **TAXES AND FEES POLICY**

Some Arena Sports programs and products are subject to tax and fees. Taxes and fees are applied at check-out and itemized on receipts. Service Fees are 100% retained by Arena Sports and then distributed to our employees to provide competitive wages and benefits, allowing for exceptional customer service and experience.
