It is our job to exceed your expectations at every step of the way and make sure you are satisfied. If at any point within 14days of delivery you are not satisfied or have had a change of circumstances and require a refund, whatever the reason, we will not hold that against you. Our 14 Day Money Back Guarantee ensures you receive the most efficient and hassle-free returns service, irrespective of the circumstances.

This policy gives our customers extra piece-of-mind and goes beyond the latest UK legislation.

How our 14 days money back guarantee works: If you’re happy with your purchase, leave us a review on Trustpilot or Facebook :) If you are considering returning your device, just get in touch and we will do our best to turn that frown upside down – some issues are easily solved. If at any stage you wish to escalate your case and contact management, you can email support@veno-scorp.co.uk If you have decided that you would like a refund, just contact us with your details and reason for cancellation, we will organise a collection. There is a fixed delivery/collection fee of £20 to return an item for change of mind. We will inspect the return as quickly as possible and process a full refund if you haven’t broken any of the rules below. Please Note that you must return each item in the same condition it was received. If you have purchased a new sealed item, this must be returned in the exact same condition otherwise a 15% Restocking fee will apply.

**Exclusions:** There are some basic conditions, some of them are just common sense, but they are worth noting to make sure there are no nasty surprises.

\- Software that has been activated is not eligible for refunds, as it is registered to you and cannot be transferred on most occasions.

\- Services such as priority turnaround and premium delivery options (e.g. Saturday delivery, pre-12 delivery, Northern Ireland, Highlands, Isles) are not eligible for refunds if they have been supplied, unless there is a problem with the product.

\- If the item is not faulty, you will need to pay for the return delivery costs as noted above.

\- Please look after the product whilst within your care, if you return it and there are signs of usage or damage then a deduction to replace / repair that part may apply.

\- Serial numbers of all components are recorded to make sure there’s no foul play.

\- For custom machines a cancellation fee would apply if there is no fault, as each one is a bespoke machine that requires many days of work to complete.

\- Damages caused in transit due to insufficient packaging are not covered by us.

\- Please backup all data , we are not responsible for any data loss.

\- Items must be returned in there original packaging and accessories which came with them. New Items must be returned with all boxes including component boxes if for any reason you do not do this then our team will notify you of the charges involved as these items must have original boxes.

**Packaging** Please pack the item in its original box & include all accessories provided.

· Please make sure the item is suitably packed to avoid damage as this will not be covered under your warranty & may require you to pay for the replacement of the damaged item.(Our recommendation is that items should be packaged in much the same manner as when you received the goods from us originally).

· Make sure the Return Sheet is clearly visible on the inside of the box. Items returned WITHOUT the Return Sheet will be rejected & returned back to you without being tested.

· Do NOT write directly onto the product packaging. Instead write on to either some brown packing paper/envelope/jiffy bag or brown outer box.

·  Please DO NOT include anything not purchased from us or not listed on the RMA as these will not be tested. Unless specifically advised to return them by us.

We recommend following these Packaging Guide Lines.

To return an item, please send an email to Customer Service : [support@veno-scorp.co.uk](mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk "mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk") to submit your return claim.

**Outside The 30-DayMoney Back Guarantee** You will be covered by the warranty supplied with your system, so in the unlikely event that a fault occurs within this period, please contact us so we can help resolve the fault.

**Please read about the Warranty before contacting us.**

If the fault cannot be rectified over the phone, we will arrange collection of your device so it can be returned to our repairs centre. Before this collection, please make sure all data is backed up as we are not liable for any data loss. We will then repair/replace any faulty components, test, and return the device to you.
