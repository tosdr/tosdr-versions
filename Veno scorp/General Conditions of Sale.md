Return Policy
=============

At VenoScorp, we are committed to providing exceptional customer service. If you're not completely satisfied with your system, we encourage you to contact us so we can address any concerns and ensure a positive experience.

**14-Day Money Back Guarantee**

We understand that purchasing online can be daunting. To offer peace of mind, we provide a 14-day money-back guarantee. If within 14 days of delivery you're not satisfied or have changed your mind, we will facilitate a return and refund process.

**How the 14-Day Money Back Guarantee Works:**

**Step 1:** Contact us by emailing [support@veno-scorp.co.uk](mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk "mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk"). Please include your Order Number and details of how we can help you.  
  

1. Contact Us: If you're considering a return, please reach out to us. Many issues can be resolved quickly, and we're here to assist.
2. Escalation: If necessary, you can escalate your case by emailing [support@veno-scorp.co.uk](mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk "mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk").
3. Refund Process: Customers can choose to use our DPD Collection Service at a cost of ¬£20, or return the item via their own carrier. After inspecting the return, we'll process a full refund, provided the conditions below are met.

**Conditions and Exclusions:**

* Notification Period: We must be notified within 14 days of you receiving your item that you wish to initiate a return for a refund. The return must then be delivered back to us within 7 days of our acceptance email.
* Software: Activated software is non-refundable, as it is registered to you and typically non-transferable.
* Services: Priority turnaround and premium delivery options (e.g., Saturday delivery, pre-12 delivery, Northern Ireland, Highlands, Isles) are non-refundable once provided, unless there's a product issue.
* Services: Priority turnaround and premium delivery options (e.g., Saturday delivery, pre-12 delivery, Northern Ireland, Highlands, Isles) are non-refundable once provided, unless there's a product issue.
* Product Care: Please maintain the product's condition. Returns showing signs of use or damage may incur deductions for repair or replacement.
* Serial Numbers: We record all component serial numbers to prevent fraud.
* Custom Machines: A cancellation fee applies for non-faulty custom machines, as each is bespoke and requires significant time to build.
* Transit Damage: Damage caused by insufficient packaging during return transit is not covered.
* Data Backup: Please back up all data; we are not responsible for data loss.
* Original Packaging: Items must be returned in their original packaging with all accessories. New items should be returned unopened and unused; otherwise, a 15% restocking fee applies.

**Important Information:**

* Packaging: Return items in their original box with all accessories. Ensure the item is securely packed to prevent damage, as this is not covered under warranty and may require you to cover replacement costs.
* Return Sheet: Include the completed Return Sheet inside the box. Items returned without it will be rejected and sent back untested.
* Labelling: Do not write directly on the product packaging. Use brown packing paper, an envelope, jiffy bag, or brown outer box.
* Additional Items: Do not include items not purchased from us or not listed on the RMA, unless specifically advised.

**Return Process:**

1. Initiate Return: Email [support@veno-scorp.co.uk](mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk "mailto:support@veno-scorp.co.uk") within the returns period from the date of receipt to obtain a Return Material Authorisation (RMA) number and form. RMAs are valid for five days from issuance.
2. Prepare Package: Place the item securely in its original packaging, include proof of purchase, and the completed Returns form.
3. Shipping: Follow the provided instructions to ship the item back to us.

**Outside the 14-Day Money Back Guarantee:**

Once the 14 days are over, you will need to refer to your Warranty Policy or your Statutory Rights.

* Refunds: Refunds are not valid past the 14-day period. After this, we can assist with repairs or replacements‚Äîno problem at all.
* Replacements/Repairs: You will be covered for repairs or replacements up to your warranty period, so there‚Äôs nothing to worry about. Your warranty is clearly displayed on the product page and available on our [Warranty Policy page](https://veno-scorp.co.uk/pages/warranty "Warranty").

**Your Statutory Rights**

Our warranty and returns policy does not affect your statutory rights. For more information about your rights under UK law regarding returns and refunds, please visit the UK Government's official website at [https://www.gov.uk/accepting-returns-and-giving-refunds](https://www.gov.uk/accepting-returns-and-giving-refunds "https://www.gov.uk/accepting-returns-and-giving-refunds").  
  
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to this policy, which helps us maintain high-quality service for all customers.
