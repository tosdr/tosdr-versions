[* 2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/)

Information to companies
========================

2fa.directory is a directory of online services. Our mission is to be an independent source of information on which services support MFA/2FA and help consumers demand MFA/2FA on the services that currently don’t. The directory is run by the non-profit organization **2factorauth**, registered in Sweden.

The content
-----------

All our content is crowdsourced and moderated by **2factorauth**. If a person requests to list a new service that meets our [listing criteria](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#site-criteria) and [guidelines](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines), it gets published in the directory.

If you find your service listed here, one of your users has requested it. If you already provide two-factor authentication, the list will function as a free promotion for your service.  
If you currently do not support two-factor authentication, the listing serves as a reminder that your customers think this is important for you to provide.

### Edit a listing

If the data about a service is inaccurate, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/issues/new/choose) or [pull request](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub to update it.

Takedown requests / DMCA
------------------------

As **2factorauth** is registered in Sweden, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act does not apply to the [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/), and thus, DMCA requests will be ignored. All the information on the [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/) is public information compliant with _fair use_. We believe consumers should be able to compare services to find the alternative that best fits them; We therefore do not remove listings.
