1\. Introduction

b) In the UK and EU, VERIFYMY LIMITED is known as the data controller of the personal data described in this Privacy Policy which means it holds and manages your personal data.

c) This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding personal data generally in the context of the Site and Service. For more detail regarding our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of biometric data (which is more limited than for most other personal data) in this context, please see the [VerifyMyAge Biometric Data Policy](https://verifymyage.com/biometric-privacy). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and ensure that you understand it.

The business customer will be responsible for protecting, keeping and using your personal data in line with data protection laws and if you have any queries in relation to this, please contact the business customer in question.

c) At other times, when we provide our Service to business customers, we will need to interact with you directly to provide more information or if you set up an account with us. Where this happens we will be the data controller, collecting and processing your personal data and be responsible for using it in line with data protection laws.

d) Finally, where you are our business customer we will collect and process certain personal data about you as part of our business relationship. We will be the data controller for this and be responsible for keeping it securely and responsibly.

10\. What are your rights?
--------------------------

If applicable, under the EU and UK data protection laws, you may have the following rights:

5. The right to restrict (i.e. prevent) the processing of your personal data.
6. The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.
7. The right to withdraw consent. This means that, if we are relying on your consent as the legal basis for using your personal data, you are free to withdraw that consent at any time.

In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request.

d) If you have any cause for complaint about our use of your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office. We would welcome the opportunity to resolve your concerns ourselves, however, so please contact us first, using the details in section 12.
