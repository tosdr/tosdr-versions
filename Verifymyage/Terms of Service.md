5\. Services and Pricing and Exclusivity
----------------------------------------

5.1. We provide age verification services to a stated Vector of Trust to online business customers who are required by law to verify the age of their customers or users before supplying certain restricted products or services.

5.2. Our prices are set out in the Schedules to these Terms of Sale and are as follows:

5.2.1 Schedule One, terms for applicable AVCS excluding eBay

5.2.2 Schedule Two, terms for applicable AVCS on eBay

5.3. Our prices are calculated on the basis that we will be your exclusive provider of age verification services for all online sales worldwide of your products or services during the term of this Contract. By entering into a Contract with us you agree that you will not directly or indirectly solicit or receive from any third party, nor will you nor any Affiliate undertake or perform, services which are the same or materially similar to the Services. In the event of any breach of this Clause 5.3, you will pay us the Liquidated Damages set out in the Schedules which you agree are a fair estimate of the loss suffered by Us as a result of any such breach.

6.2. No part of Our Site constitutes a contractual offer capable of acceptance. Setting up your account constitutes a contractual offer to Us that We may, at Our sole discretion, accept. Our acknowledgement of receipt of your account details does not mean that We have accepted them. Our acceptance is indicated by Us sending you an account set up confirmation by email. As part of the account set up process we may make a small test charge against your chosen payment method. Only once We have sent you an account set up confirmation email will there be a legally binding contract between Us and you (“the Contract”).

6.3 Once your account has been set up, you can make AVC requests via our API. Each successful request for AVC (i.e. where the subject is verified by Us as being over 18 years old) returned to you will incur a fee in line with our standard pricing as set out in the Schedules.

* * *

7\. Payment
-----------

7.1. We will invoice you at the end of each Service Period, or when your account has incurred £1,000 in fees, if sooner (in which case that Service Period will terminate early and a new Service Period will commence on the day following our invoice). We will automatically charge the payment card associated with your account.

7.2. All sums due must be paid in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding (except where any deduction or withholding of tax is required by law).

7.3. If you do not make any payment to Us by the due date as shown on Our invoice, We may charge you interest on the overdue sum at the rate of 4% per annum above the base lending rate of Starling Bank Limited from time to time. Interest will accrue on a daily basis from the due date for payment until the actual date of payment of the overdue sum, whether before or after judgment. You must pay any interest due when paying an overdue sum; and

7.4. The provisions of sub-Clause 7.3 will not apply if you have promptly contacted Us to dispute an invoice in good faith. No interest will be payable while such a dispute is ongoing. Once any such dispute is resolved, We will charge interest on correctly invoiced sums from the original due date.

* * *

8\. Provision of the Services

Any and all personal data processed by Us (as a data processor) on your behalf (as a data controller) in the course of providing the Services shall be processed in accordance with the terms of a separate Data Processing Agreement between Us and you, as per the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.
