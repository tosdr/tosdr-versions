4\. Description of GeoGuessr

Game description.GeoGuessr is a geography game which takes you on a journey around the world and challenges your ability to recognize your surroundings. Your user character is placed on a designated place somewhere in the world and your mission is to figure out, based on your surroundings, where your user character is situated. You score points by pinning the exact location of your character on a map of the world. The closer you get to the designated place, the more points you score. You can play for yourself or challenge others to play. GeoGuessr is made available on our website and through our apps for iOS and Android software.

We have a strong community and social features are a core component of our games. Other players may therefore access your profile data, game statistics, in-game activities and game summaries (including replays). You will be able to connect with other players and send messages via the website or app. Further, there are official leaderboards where your results will be displayed.

GeoGuessr also offers a range of quizzes, testing your knowledge within geography and other topics. These are made available on our website and through our apps for iOS and Android software.

9\. Virtual items

Virtual items.Virtual items can be purchased or earned in GeoGuessr that give you access to various game features. There are two types of virtual items available:

1. virtual currency, which means currency that you cannot physically touch such as virtual tokens, gems, coins, cash, points, bonuses or other form of virtual currencies that can be used within GeoGuessr to purchase virtual goods; and
2. virtual goods, which means anything virtual which can be used by you within GeoGuessr to enhance your player experience.

Purchasing or earning virtual items.We offer you the opportunity to either:

1. purchase virtual items within GeoGuessr for ´real´ money;
2. earn virtual items as part of being a GeoGuessr Pro subscriber;
3. earn virtual items as part of our or third parties’ promotional offers, competitions or actions; or
4. earn virtual items through playing GeoGuessr.

Purchased virtual items have priority and will always be consumed before any earned virtual items.

License to virtual items.Your use of virtual items is subject to the following license:

1. You do not own virtual items but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable license to use them. All rights, title and interest in and to all of the content, including virtual items, that appears in GeoGuessr are owned or licensed by us, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under applicable laws;
2. Virtual items are not redeemable or refundable;
3. Any virtual currency balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but measures the extent of your limited license to use virtual items within GeoGuessr;
4. Virtual items are personal to you and non-transferable. This means that only you can use your virtual items and you cannot permit anyone else to use them whether via your account or otherwise. You cannot trade your virtual items in any way whether by selling them for real money to other players, exchanging them for other items or dealing or disposing of them in any other way (with the exception of any in-game virtual item auction function that we may offer);
5. Your right to use virtual items ends as a result of us having to suspend or close your account pursuant to these Terms;
6. We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any virtual items without any liability to you at any time; and

Prices.The price payable by you for virtual items is indicated at the time you make your purchase. The price includes any explicitly set out relevant value added tax (VAT) or other fees and taxes. Please note that your bank may charge you with additional fees, such as interchange fees or currency conversion fees. We reserve the right to change the price and specifications for any virtual items at any time for any reason.

Access.Once you have completed your payment, you will receive an email confirmation of your purchase of virtual items, at which point a mutual contract will come into existence. You will get access to your purchased virtual items directly upon a successful check-out.

Availability of virtual items.We reserve the right to limit the amount of virtual items you can purchase in a given period, and/or limit the total amount of virtual items that may be held in your account in the aggregate. Virtual items may only be purchased and used by players in jurisdictions where such activities are permitted under applicable law. Virtual items may only be purchased through the game or as otherwise expressly authorized. We reserve the right to refuse any request to purchase virtual items for any reason.

Reimbursement.We may cancel a payment and make a reimbursement to you, including any transaction fees incurred with payment service providers, if it has reason to believe: (a) any purchase is incomplete; or (b) any purchase is made, or we suspect it is made through fraudulent means or otherwise in bad faith.

### Simply put:

You can earn or purchase virtual items in GeoGuessr, in the form of virtual currency or virtual goods, that give you access to various game features. Virtual items are not refundable, so once you have purchased virtual items you will not get the ‘real’ money you paid back.
