Third-Party Links

The Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties (the "External Sites"). Even if the third party is affiliated with P&G, P&G has no control over these External Sites, all of which have separate privacy policies, data collection practices and terms and conditions independent of P&G. P&G has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you access them at your own risk.

Some social networking platforms enable functionality that allows a user to receive and transmit data to the social networking platform through use of overlays or other technology. Although it may appear that the data is collected by P&G, the data is in fact collected directly by the social networking platform and/or a third-party service provider. Your use of a social network platform to share any information is subject to, and you must comply with, the terms, conditions and restrictions of that social network platform.

Geographic Scope of Site and Product Claims

P&G controls and operates the Sites from within the United States of America. Each claim or statement about the effectiveness of P&G products and/or each claim or statement comparing the effectiveness of P&G products to the effectiveness of other products is expressly limited to the United States, unless otherwise disclosed on the Site. Unless otherwise specified in or by the Sites, the Sites are intended to promote only those P&G products that are sold by P&G in the United States and its territories, and P&G makes no representation that materials in its Web Sites or the products described thereby are appropriate or available for use in other locations.

P&G makes no representation that the contents of any Site are appropriate or available for use in locations outside of the State of Ohio.

Contents of the Site – Disclaimer

The materials the Site (including any graphics, software, recommendations or other materials) and any materials made available through the Site are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, P&G disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials in the Site in terms of its correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. The materials in the Site could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. These materials could be inaccurate or become inaccurate as a result of development occurring after their respective dates. P&G undertakes no obligation to verify or maintain the accuracy of such information. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.

### 

Operation of the Site – Disclaimer

P&G endeavors to maintain the Site and its operation, but is not, and cannot be, responsible for the results of any defects that may exist in the Site or its operation. **As to the operation of the Site, P&G expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to all implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G makes no warranty that (i) the operation of the Site will meet the user’s requirements; (ii) access to the Site will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, free of viruses, worms, Trojan Horses or other harmful components, or free of defects or errors; (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Site will be accurate or reliable; or (iv) defects will be corrected. You (and not P&G) assume the entire cost of all servicing, repair, or correction that may be necessary for your computer equipment and software as a result of any viruses, errors or any other problems whatsoever you may have as a result of visiting the Site.** Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.

### 

Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL P&G BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL, DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF P&G HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THIS SITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

If the foregoing limitation of liability is held to be unenforceable, the Providers’ maximum liability to you shall not exceed the amount paid by you for the products or services you have ordered through the Site. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages, so the above limitations and exclusion may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdiction’s law is applicable to these Terms. If the law applies to you and your use of the Site does not permit the waiver by you of any rights or remedies, these Terms do not require you to waive any of such rights.

[Back to Top](#main-content)

### 

Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless P&G, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation by you of the Terms, your use of the Site (including negligent or wrongful conduct) and/or the use of any Site for which you have registered by any other person using your user account.

### 

Applicable Law and Disputes

To the extent permitted by law, the Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in all respects in accordance with the substantive laws of the state of Ohio, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on contracts for the international sale of goods. You agree that except as specified herein, any disputes directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Site (including the purchase of P&G products via the Site) shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Hamilton County, Ohio. You hereby irrevocably consent to such venue and to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court over any such dispute.

Notwithstanding such Rules, however, such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the state of Ohio, U.S.A. Any award in any arbitration initiated hereunder shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount. Further, the arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages in any arbitration initiated under this section, except as may be required by statute.

Any cause of action or claim you may have directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Site (including the purchase of P&G products via the Site) must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.

The Privacy Statement provides separate options for individuals to lodge complaints in relation to the Privacy Statement and their personal information.

[Back to Top](#main-content)

### 

No Waiver

No failure on the part of P&G to enforce any part of the Terms shall constitute a waiver of any of P&G’s rights under the Terms whether for part or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by P&G nor the reliance of any person on P&G’s actions shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of the Terms. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of P&G shall have any legal effect whatsoever.
