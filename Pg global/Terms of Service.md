P&G has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions or the content of such web sites.

Some social networking platforms enable functionality that allows a user to receive and transmit data to the social networking platform through use of overlays or other technology.

Your use of a social network platform to share any information is subject to, and you must comply with, the terms, conditions and restrictions of that social network platform and/or of the third-party service provider.

Contents of the Site – Disclaimer

All Content of the Site and any materials made available through the Site are provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, P&G disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement. P&G does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the materials in the Site in terms of its correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise. The materials in the Site could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. These materials could be inaccurate or become inaccurate as a result of development occurring after their respective dates. P&G undertakes no obligation to verify or maintain the accuracy of such information. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.

### 

Operation of the Site – Disclaimer

P&G endeavors to maintain the Site and its operation, but is not, and cannot be, responsible for the results of any defects that may exist in the Site or its operation. As to the operation of the Site, P&G expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to all implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.

You (and not P&G) assume the entire cost of all servicing, repair, or correction that may be necessary for your computer equipment and software as a result of any viruses, errors or any other problems whatsoever you may have as a result of visiting the Site.

### 

Limitation of Liability

**IN NO EVENT SHALL P&G BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, .PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL, DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF P&G HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THIS SITE. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.**

If the foregoing limitation of liability is held to be unenforceable, the Providers’ maximum liability to you shall not exceed the amount paid by you for the products or services you have ordered through the Site. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages, so the above limitations and exclusion may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdiction’s law is applicable to these Terms. If the law applies to you and your use of the Site does not permit the waiver by you of any rights or remedies, these Terms do not require you to waive any of such rights.

### 

Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless P&G, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation by you of the Terms, your use of the Site (including negligent or wrongful conduct) and/or the use of any Site for which you have registered by any other person using your user account.

### 

Applicable Law and Disputes

To the extent permitted by law, the Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in all respects in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

**YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST P&G (INCLUDING ANY P&G BRAND) ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER ACTION OR PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.**

There might be an occasion in which you and P&G (including any P&G Brand) are subject to a Dispute (as defined below) that directly or indirectly arises out of, or relates, to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand). In the event of such a Dispute, you agree (i) to comply with the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process as set forth below, and, (ii) that, if the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process does not resolve the Dispute, then you will comply with the Formal Dispute Resolution Process.

**Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process**

For any Dispute that arises between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) concerning or otherwise related to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand), you agree that you will first make a good faith effort to resolve such a Dispute informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, as set forth below.

This informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent and prerequisite to commencing legal action against P&G (including any P&G brand). This informal dispute resolution process requires that you send a written description of the Dispute, including the nature and basis of the claim and the nature and basis of the specific relief sought (with a calculation for it), to the other party that also includes contact information (name, address, email, phone number, and, if applicable, account number, purchase order numbers, and transaction confirmation codes) (the “Notice”). For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send this Notice, along with this contact information and other data sufficient for us to identify your transaction, account, or other relevant information with us at the following: The Procter & Gamble Company, C T Corporation System 4400 Easton Commons Way Suite 125 Columbus, Ohio 43219. You must personally sign the Notice (along with an attorney if you are represented) that is mailed to us.

After the Notice of your intent to engage in the informal dispute resolution process is transmitted and received by us, in accordance with the aforementioned instructions, each party hereby agrees to promptly negotiate in good faith about the Dispute. This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the fully completed Notice of the informal dispute, each party agrees to the Formal Dispute Resolution Process set forth below. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enforce the terms of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process.

**Formal Dispute Resolution Process**

Any Dispute between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand) that cannot be resolved through the aforementioned informal dispute resolution process shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Hamilton County, Ohio. You hereby irrevocably consent to such venue and to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court over any such dispute. **YOU FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND P&G (INCLUDING BETWEEN YOU AND ANY P&G BRAND) CONCERNING OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THESE TERMS, A P&G WEBSITE, OR YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF A PRODUCT, GOOD, OR SERVICE FROM P&G (INCLUDING A P&G BRAND).**

**Miscellaneous**

Any cause of action or claim you may have directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.

The Privacy Statement provides separate options for individuals to lodge complaints in relation to the Privacy Statement and their personal information.

These dispute resolution processes do not limit your obligations to comply with any other provisions or requirements in these Terms, including the “Notices And Procedures For Making Claims Of Copyright Infringement”.

**Terms**

For purposes of these Terms, the term “Dispute” shall be interpreted as broadly as permitted under the law and shall cover any claim or controversy, related to P&G or our relationship with you, including but not limited to, any and all: (i) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms; (iii) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms; and (iv) claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation.

### 

No Waiver

No failure on the part of P&G to enforce any part of the Terms shall constitute a waiver of any of P&G’s rights under the Terms whether for part or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by P&G nor the reliance of any person on P&G’s actions shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of the Terms. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of P&G shall have any legal effect whatsoever.
