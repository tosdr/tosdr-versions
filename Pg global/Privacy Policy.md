Data Subject Rights Requests

Depending on your location (the jurisdiction in which you are a resident), you may have different data subject rights available to you. These may include requests for access, erasure, rectification/correction, to opt out of receiving marketing emails or texts, object to our use of your email address or phone number for advertising, etc. To submit a Data Subject Rights requests for your jurisdiction, click [here](https://preferencecenter.pg.com/en-us/datarequests/).

You can also tell us to stop sending you email and text messages by following the opt-out instructions sent with these communications. Please be aware that we may need to keep certain information to honor your choices (e.g., if you tell us to stop sending marketing emails, we will need your email address on file so that our systems remember that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications to that email address).

Also, there are some situations where we may be unable to grant your request (e.g., deleting transaction data where we have a legal obligation to keep it, or for fraud prevention, security, or to protect the privacy of others, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, among other things).

How you exercise choice as to interest-based ads

**Advertising Industry Opt-Outs**

For the U.S., to exercise choice with respect to interest-based advertising, you can utilize the opt-out mechanism provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) by [clicking here](http://optout.aboutads.info/) (for browsers) or [here](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) (for app-based opt-outs).

The Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

For Europe, you may click [here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to learn more about the DAA-Europe’s opt-out program.

For Canada, you may click [here](https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools) to learn more about the DAA Canada’s opt-out program.

To opt-out of Unified ID 2.0 globally [click here](https://www.transparentadvertising.org/).

Please be aware that, even if you opt-out of certain kinds of interest-based ads, you may continue to receive other ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect services provided by the applicable DAA / NAI members but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from non-participating parties. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your DAA / NAI browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third party opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

You can also prevent or reduce getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your browser(s), or on mobile devices by declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually present when you install them or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.

Please note that you may also receive personalized ads based on your email address or phone number, if you have provided those to us for marketing purposes. To opt out of that usage, please [contact us.](https://preferencecenter.pg.com/en-us/datarequests/)

You will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads. Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices. These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads. Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities over time and across unrelated services, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting. For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors. You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud, pursuant to applicable laws.

Background

How You Can Control Cookies

You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer. However, this may prevent our sites or services from working properly. You can also set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing.

When you opt-out of interest-based advertising, an opt-out cookie is sent to your browser that indicates that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads. Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete all cookies on your browser. This means that you will need to opt-out again on each browser where you have deleted cookies if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.

In some markets and on some of our websites, we offer a cookie consent management platform which allows you to exercise choice with respect to certain categories of cookies. If this is available, this may appear as a cookie banner and/or as an icon that is visible on the applicable websites. We may also provide similar technology in mobile apps, which, if available, will be accessible through the applicable app’s settings menu.

Additional Information for EEA, Switzerland, and UK Residents

If you live in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, or are physically in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, you may access the personal data we hold about you, request that inaccurate, outdated, or no longer necessary information be corrected, erased, or restricted, and ask us to provide your data in a format that allows you to transfer it to another service provider. You also may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on your consent for the processing of your personal data. And you may object to our processing of your personal data (this means ask us to stop using it) where that processing is based on our legitimate interest (this means we have a legitimate reason for using the data for a certain purpose and this reason is not outweighed by your interest in P&G not using it). To make a request, [click here](https://privacypolicy.pg.com/contactus/privacy-central-contact-interactive/) .

We do this respectfully and carefully to protect your rights. Personal data can help us better understand your interests and preferences as a consumer and a person.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background

How We Collect Personal Data

We collect personal data about you in many ways and from many places. Some of the personal data we collect may include personal data that can be used to identify you; for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or postal address. In some jurisdictions, things like IP address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered personal data.

Background

You Share it Directly

You give us your personal data when signing up for an account on our websites or mobile apps or by calling or emailing us. We may ask for things like your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us to send you information about our products and services—for example, to your home address, email address, or by texting you.

Background

You Interact with Websites & Emails

We may use technologies that automatically collect information when you visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services. For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, and about your online activities such as web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have not opened an email from us.

Background

You Use Mobile Apps & Other Devices

To give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or our “smart” devices in your home. You consent to this when downloading the app or installing household internet connected devices. This information could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, your physical location, and other information that is considered personal data in some jurisdictions. You will get a pop-up notice on your phone or device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are accessing the internet) or to collect or access other personal data, as required by the applicable laws.

Background

You Connect with Partners or Third Parties

We may get information that other companies share with or sell to us. For example, you may have given consent for another company to share your personal data with us when you signed up for telecom services or a retailer loyalty points program. Where possible, we may also collect personal data from publicly available sources, such as from internet postings, blog entries, videos, or social media sites. We may also receive personal data from other companies, such as consumer data resellers, who are in the business of collecting or aggregating information about you sourced from publicly available databases (in line with local legal requirements as applicable) or from consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your personal data. This might include information about your income level, age, gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.

How We Use Cookies

Cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web. They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit. You can learn more about how to control cookies

here.

We use cookies in several ways, such as:

* to allow you to browse the website and use its features
    
* to serve you with relevant advertising and measure the effectiveness of such advertising
    
* to ensure that you are not shown an ad more than you should be (called “frequency capping”)
    
* to learn more about the way you interact with P&G content
    
* to help us improve your experience when visiting our websites
    
* to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there is no need for you to customize the website on each visit
    
* to identify errors and resolve them
    
* to analyze how well our websites are performing
    

Background

Types of Cookies We Use

**Strictly Necessary Cookies:**  These cookies (also sometimes referred to as “essential”) allow the page to load or provide some essential functionality without which the page would not work (i.e., store your data in a shopping cart).

**Functional Cookies:**  These cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you come back again. For example, if you choose to read the site in French on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in French. Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly for you.

**Advertising Cookies:**  These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the products you buy. That data allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need. It also allows us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.

**Analytics Cookies:**  These cookies tell us how you use our websites, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked. This helps us measure and improve the performance of our websites. We use different analytics cookies in different jurisdictions. In many cases, we use Google Analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**Social Media Cookies**: These cookies, that are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site, allow you to share our content with your friends and networks and enable us to reach you with ads on those social platforms related to your visits on our sites. The cookies of some social media sites, e.g., Facebook, are also used for ad targeting.

Background

Interest-Based Advertising

When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see. For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children’s clothing or school supplies. And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product. In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you. To learn more about your choices regarding interest-based advertising go

here.

**We Learn from Groups of Consumers Sharing Similar Interests:**  We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same interests. For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados” if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a “bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or sales. We may infer these things about you based on your activity on certain web pages, links you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails, as well based on other information we have collected, such as from retailer partners and other third parties. We group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online and/or offline. By doing this, we can find and serve many others who “look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.

**We Link Other Information to Your Cookie and Device IDs:**  Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites. We generally do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you. For example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on a person’s web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits. Should we want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and app viewing history), we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.

**We May Know You Across Your Computers, Tablets, Phones and Devices:**  We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device ID EFG15647. This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone. We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example, they sign on to the same Wi-Fi network every day at the same time. Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across your devices. And this is important because that way you don’t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.

**Addressable Media:**  When you provide us with your personal data via our sites or apps, we will use an encryption of that data – or a substitute identifier such as The Trade Desk's UID2 -- to serve you with ads we think you may like. We do this generally by uploading a pseudonymized version (replaced with artificial letters or numbers) of your email address, phone number, or your mobile advertising ID to a platform that offers ad space (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.). We also use that same data to serve you advertising through what is called the open web. This means you may see relevant ads from us on sites like nytimes.com or apps or other places like digital TV that participate in online auctions of their ad inventory.

**Advanced Matching:**  Some of our sites use the Advanced Matching features offered by Social Media Platforms to its advertisers (e.g. [Facebook’s Advanced Matching](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668?id=1205376682832142), [TikTok’s Advanced Matching](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10007891), etc.). Through Advanced Matching, we will send some of the personal data you enter on our site form fields (e.g., your name, email address, and phone number – not any sensitive or special category data) in a pseudonymized format to the Social Media Platform, or the Social Media Platform Pixel will pseudonymize and pull that data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser cookie or device ID. We do this so that we can better target and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on the respective Social Media platforms. This is how we can know that if we showed you an ad on a given Social Media Platform, you clicked on it, came to our site and bought something – or not – and therefore whether we should continue to buy ads on that Social Media Platform – or not.

**Google Analytics Advertising Features**: Some of our sites use [Google Remarketing Lists for Search Ads with Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6212951?hl=en#:~:text=Remarketing%20lists%20for%20search%20ads%20(RLSA)%20with%20Analytics%20works%20much,advertising%20cookies%20on%20users'%20browsers) (“RLSA”), which is a service they offer to advertisers. When individuals visit our sites, Google Analytics collects data about their visits. If a visitor is signed into their Google account, we are able to provide that user with interest-based advertising when they conduct a Google search for terms related to the P&G site they visited. For example, if you are signed into a Google account when visiting our Head & Shoulders website, we may provide you with Head & Shoulders advertising when you search for “dandruff shampoo” on Google. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). To understand how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps, visit [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You may [opt out of Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) at any time.

**Microsoft Advertising Features**: Some of our sites use Microsoft Universal Event Tracking, which is a service they offer to advertisers. When individuals visit our sites, Microsoft collects data about their visits so that we are better able to provide them with interest-based advertising. To understand how Microsoft uses data, visit the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).

Background

Other Technologies We May Use

**Proximity-Based Beacons:**  Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are on-sale as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the mobile application associated with a particular beacon. In turn, apps may provide us location information to help customize advertising and offers to you. For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.

**Pixels:**  These are small objects embedded into a web page but are not visible. They are also known as "tags,” “web bugs,” or "pixel gifs." We use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing activities. We also include pixels in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open them and click on their links. This helps us understand whether you are an active user (which will prevent your data from being deleted due to inactivity). It also helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and derive insights and analysis, that we will use to personalize the content of our communication and to guide our marketing decisions (for example, if you opened an email but did not click on the links in it, we may decide to retarget you on Facebook).

**Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs:**  We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information as you use our apps which is like what cookies collect on our websites. This will be information like your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and the way you use our apps.

**Precise Geolocation:**  We may receive information about your exact location from things like global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude) when you use our mobile apps. You will always get a pop-up notice on your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to know exactly where you are in the world. You should understand that we will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a broader city, postal code, or province. For example, we do not consider it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in Manila, Philippines.

Background

Site and App Content

**Plugins:**  Our websites may include plugins from other companies such as social networks. An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button. These plugins may collect information (e.g., the URL of the page you visited) and send it back to the company that created them. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the company that created them, even though they appear on our sites.

**Logins:**  Our websites may allow you to log in using your account with another company such as, for example, “Login with Facebook.” When you do this, we will have access only to the information that you have given us consent to receive from your account settings in the other company’s account you’re using to log in with.

**User Content:**  Some of our sites and apps will allow you to upload your own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions. Please remember that any information you submit or post becomes public information. We do not have control over how others may use the content you submit to our sites and apps. We are not responsible for such uses in ways that may violate this privacy policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.

**Links:**  P&G sites may include links to other sites, which we do not control. Those sites will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms, not ours.

Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

Automated decision-making implies making a decision using automated means without human involvement. Profiling is a form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal characteristics of an individual for the purpose of analyzing or predicting, for example, that individual’s personal preferences, interests, likely behavior, etc.

As you have read in this Privacy Policy, we collect a variety of types of personal data both from you and from other commercially available sources. This data is combined and analyzed, including sometimes using algorithms, to identify links between certain behaviors and personal characteristics. P&G users who have similar characteristics or have performed similar actions are likely to share similar interests in our products: based on this analysis, segments of P&G consumers are created and targeted accordingly with relevant offers via email, online advertising, and social media.

This process allows us to customize our communications to your declared or inferred interests. However, we will not conduct any automated decision-making processes, including profiling, that can produce legal effects or that can similarly significantly affect your rights and freedoms, as per Art. 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, should we want to engage in more intrusive profiling and tracking practices, we will always inform you and, where legally required, ask for your consent before doing so or provide you with the right to opt-out.

How We Disclose Personal Data

plus

Background

With Your Consent

When we have your consent, we may disclose your personal data to others, such as select partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or services we believe you may be interested in. For example, people who receive P&G emails from our diaper brands such as Pampers® may also consent to hear about baby formulas from other companies.

Background

Online Platforms and Ad Tech Companies

Our websites and applications may make available contact information, unique identifiers, inferred and derived information, online and technical information and geolocation data with online platforms and ad tech companies to help us serve you relevant advertisements and offers, subject to applicable legal requirements, which may include consent and/or opt-outs.  We do not sell your personal data to marketers outside of P&G in exchange for monetary compensation. Please see the U.S. State Privacy Notice section of the privacy policy below for additional information.

Background

Vendors

We may disclose or otherwise make available your personal data to our vendors (including “service providers” and “processors” defined under applicable laws, which we collectively refer to as “**service providers**” or “**vendors**” herein) who help us run our business. This includes hosting our sites, processing payment information for the purchases made by you through our sites, delivering our emails and marketing communications to you, analyzing the data we collect, helping us with sales attribution (e.g., to see if we showed you an ad on a platform site and then you bought a product from us) and sending you the products and services you requested. We also disclose or otherwise make available your personal data with lawyers, auditors, consultants, information technology and security firms, and others who provide services to us. We disclose or otherwise make available only the personal data needed for these companies to complete the tasks we request or, where permitted by applicable law, use the personal data for certain internal purposes such as security or fraud detection. We instruct our service providers to appropriately process and protect your personal data.

Background

Payments for Purchases

Payments for purchases made through some of our sites are completed using a third-party vendor’s online payment system.  For these sites, P&G does not have access to your credit card information provided for purchases and does not store or disclose your credit card information as part of your purchases through these third-party systems. The personal or financial information you provide to our online payment system on these sites is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy and terms of use and we recommend you review these policies before providing any personal or financial information.

Background

Legal and Similar Reasons

If a brand or one of our businesses that controls your personal data, or some or all of its business assets, are sold to another company, your personal data will be disclosed to that company. We may also disclose your information to companies who help us protect our rights and property, or when required by law, legal processes, government authorities or as reasonably necessary to protect the rights or interests of ourselves or others.

Children’s Personal Data

plus

We follow all applicable data protection laws when collecting personal data online from children, including by obtaining parental consent where required, based on the applicable age standard. For example, we obtain consent from the holder of parental responsibility of a child in the EEA, Switzerland, Serbia, and the UK when we collect personal data from children under 16 years of age. Similarly, in the U.S., we obtain verified parental consent when collecting personal data from children younger than 13. In Canada, these verified parental consent measures are in place for minors younger than 14. We do not use personal data collected from children for targeted advertising.

How We Protect Your Personal Information

plus

**Your privacy is important. That’s why we respect it by taking steps to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, or alteration.**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have processes and controls in place to appropriately manage personal data, including its collection, use, disclosure, retention, and destruction. We respect your personal data and take steps to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration. Where appropriate, these steps can include technical measures like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, unique and complex passwords, and encryption. We also use organizational and physical measures such as training staff on data processing obligations, identification of data incidents and risks, restricting staff access to your personal information, and ensuring physical security including appropriately securing documents when not being used.

International Transfers

plus

P&G has its head offices in the United States, regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, Geneva and Panama and further P&G service centers in other countries, like Costa Rica or Philippines. As a multinational company, P&G undertakes data transfers, either within the P&G group of entities, or when sharing your data with service providers or selected partners that may store, process, or access your data in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. Personal data collected from Quebec, for example, may be transferred outside of Canada with adequate protections and safeguards in place.

As far as EU citizens are concerned, (but also citizens of Switzerland, UK and Serbia for example) this means that their data may be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), either in countries have been recognized by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection, like the United Kingdom (from where, for example, some of our fulfillment, return and contact center services are managed for the EU region), or Switzerland (where our EU headquarters are located), or in other countries that are not deemed, by the European Commission, as offering such level of data protection. For such transfers of data, because special safeguards need to be foreseen to ensure that the protection travels with the data, we use the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, standardized and pre-approved model data protection clauses. You can find the latest version of the approved EU Standard Contractual Clauses, including the different transfer modules, [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914). Our transfer agreements also incorporate the standard data protection clauses issued in accordance with UK, Swiss and Serbian data protection law If you have any questions with reference to our data transfer agreements, please [contact us](mailto:corporateprivacy.im@pg.com).

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland, please note that P&G is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) \[collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”\] developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and Information Commissioner and Swiss Federal Data Protection, respectively, regarding the transfer of personal information from the EEA, United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland to the U.S., [Click here](https://privacypolicy.pg.com/DPF/ConsumerPolicy/) to view our _Data Privacy Framework: Consumer Privacy Policy_.

For non-EEA and UK data, we perform such transfers based on your consent, or on our contracts, where so required by local law.

We also may disclose each category of personal data and sensitive personal data in the table to the following categories of recipients in a manner that does not constitute Sale or Sharing:

• The Consumer or to other parties at your direction or through your intentional action

• Recipients to whom personal data is disclosed for

legal and similar reasons

• In addition, our Vendors and the other recipients listed in the above table may, subject to contractual restrictions imposed by us and/or legal obligations, also use and disclose your personal data for business purposes. For example, our Vendors and the other categories of recipients listed in the table above may engage subcontractors to enable them to perform services for us or process for our business purposes.

Background

Consumer Rights Requests

As described in further detail below, subject to meeting the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below), we provide Consumers – which are, for clarity, residents of certain states – the privacy rights described in this section. For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion in how we process such requests. For states that have passed consumer privacy laws, but are not yet in effect, we will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in our discretion.

Background

Making a Request and Scope of Requests

As permitted by the U.S. Privacy Laws, certain requests you submit to us are subject to an identity verification process (“**Verifiable Consumer Request**”) as described below in the “Verifying Your Request” section below. We will not fulfill such requests unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal information.

To make a request, please submit your request to us by one of the methods below. For further instructions on how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request, for non-cookie PI (as defined below), please go to the “

Do Not Sell/Share/Target” section below.

* Calling us at **(877) 701-0404** 
    
* Visiting our [Preference Center](https://preferencecenter.pg.com/en-us/datarequests/) (which can be reached by the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://preferencecenter.pg.com/en-us/datarequests/)” link in the footer of our websites or via the Settings menu in our mobile applications)
    

Some personal data we maintain about you is not sufficiently associated with enough of your other personal data for us to be able to verify that it is your particular personal data (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that personal data in response to those requests. If we deny a verified request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request. We will use personal data provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify personal data that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, we may refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that we may refuse a request, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.

Background

Verifying Your Request

To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal data or considering your deletion request. Upon receipt of your request, we will send you a verification form by email or postal mail. To complete your request, please respond to the verification form when you receive it. To verify your identity, we may require you to provide any of the following information: Name, email address, postal address, or date of birth.

We will review the information provided as part of your request and may ask you to provide additional information via e-mail or other means as part of this verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces/Portability), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal data. The same verification process does not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation of Sensitive Personal Data requests, but we may apply some verification measures if we suspect fraud.

The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We verify your categories requests and certain deletion and correction requests (e.g., those that are less sensitive in nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. For certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate to personal data that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply a verification standard of reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under penalty of perjury, that you are the individual whose personal data is the subject of the request.

If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the requested information, we will still take certain actions as required by certain U.S. Privacy Laws. For example:

* If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this U.S. State Privacy Notice for a general description of our data practices.
    
* If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories request.
    

Background

Authorizing an Agent

You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf by submitting a request in the manners described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, the U.S. Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request (except Do Not Sell/Share requests) and allow us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized you to make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as permitted under the U.S. Privacy Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request. To make a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a Consumer, click [here](https://preferencecenter.pg.com/en-us/moreoption/)**.**

Right to Know/Access

Background

Right to Know–- Categories Request

You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:

* the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
    
* the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;
    
* the business or commercial purposes for which we collected or sold the personal information;
    
* the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the personal information, by category or categories of personal information for each category of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;
    
* the categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of persons to whom disclosed that information for a business purpose.
    

Background

Right to Know–- Specific Pieces

You have the right to request a transportable copy of the specific pieces of personal data we collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request. Please note that personal data is retained by us for various time periods, so there may be certain information that we have collected about you that we do not even retain for 12 months (and thus, it would not be able to be included in our response to you). Please also note that you may be limited under your applicable state’s law to making a certain number of “right to know” requests in any 12-month period.

Background

Right to Delete

In addition, you have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you. Please understand that P&G cannot delete personal data in those situations where our retention is required for our own internal business purposes or otherwise permitted by relevant U.S. Privacy Laws (such as fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these situations, we will retain your personal data in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.

Background

Right to Correct

You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in your personal data maintained by us. Your request to correct is subject to our verification (discussed above) and the response standards in the applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.

Background

Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Data Processing

Certain personal data qualifies as “sensitive personal data” or “sensitive personal information” under U.S. Privacy Laws, which we refer to in this U.S. State Privacy Notice as “Sensitive Personal Data”. Some U.S Privacy Laws require consent for the processing of Sensitive Personal Data, which can be revoked, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions (for example, if the processing of your Sensitive Personal Data is required to provide a product or service specifically requested by you). Depending on your state of residence, you have the right to revoke such consent, if applicable, and/or direct businesses to limit their use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data if they use or disclose it beyond certain internal business purposes. You can make a request using the methods set forth above.

Background

Rights as to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

You have the right to opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. However, as discussed

above , we do not carry out profiling or automated decision-making activities in a manner that requires us to provide opt-out rights.

Background

Do Not Sell/Share/Target

Under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. Some states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California’s law refers to as “cross-context behavioral advertising”, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of personal data from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available personal information to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing personal information for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of personal data under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available personal data to a third party.

When you provide us personal data for the following Processing Purposes, we may use certain personal data that you provide for such purposes, to advertise to you. This may include making available your personal data to certain third parties in way that may constitute a Sale and/or Sharing, as well as using your personal data for purposes of Targeted Advertising.

•

Products/Services.

•

Customer Management.

•

Customer Service/Communications,

•

Serving Ads.

•

Ads Administration,

• Purposes Disclosed at Collection

Third-Party digital businesses, including online platforms (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) and AdTech companies such as Demand Side Platforms which help us place advertisements (“**Third-Party Digital Businesses**”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect personal data about you on our apps and websites, or otherwise collect and process personal data that we make available about you, including digital activity information. Giving access to personal data on our websites or apps, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate processing for purposes of Targeted Advertising under some U.S. Privacy Laws. Therefore, we will treat such personal data collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the personal data we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on our websites or apps, or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “**cookie PI**”). However, certain personal data which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address (which we refer to below as “**non-cookie PI**”).

When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting you out of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that our opt-out process is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for opting out are below. **_Please note that there are distinct instructions for opting out of cookie PI and non-cookie PI, which we explain further, below._**

**Opt-out for non-cookie PI**: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request [here](https://pg-lex.my.salesforce-sites.com/DNSForm/?Country=us&language=en).

**Opt-out for cookie PI**: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie PI for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such personal data, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool. To do so, click “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information / Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising” in the footer of each of our websites and/or in the Settings menu of each of our mobile applications.  Then follow the instructions for the toggle. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-outs of cookie PI and of non-cookie PI. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device.

You must exercise your preferences separately on each of our websites that you visit, within each of our mobile applications that you use, if you use a different browser than the one on which you originally opted out, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be affective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.

For more information about how we have shared your personal data with third parties such that it constitutes a “Sale” or “Share” under CCPA during the 12-month period prior to the date this privacy policy was last updated, please refer to the chart above. We do not knowingly Sell or Share personal data of minors older than 13 years of age and under 16 years of age without their consent.

Background

Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)

Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals and in other states as universal opt-out mechanisms. GPC is a signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal data, or of processing of personal data for Targeted Advertising. To use GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website and mobile applications, which is explained by our consent management platform [here](https://www.onetrust.com/blog/onetrust-partners-with-gpc-control-privacy/).

Certain of the U.S. Privacy Laws require us to explain how we process GPC signals in detail, specifically how we apply GPC signals and the corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests to online data (what we refer to above as “cookie PI”) and offline data (what we refer to above as “non-cookie PI”). Below we explain the scenarios in which we apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests communicated by GPC signals to cookie PI and, where applicable, to non-cookie PI:

• When you are visiting our website on a particular internet browser (“browser 1”), we will apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target to cookie PI collected on that browser 1.

• When you log in on browser 1: We will be able to apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target request to non-cookie PI associated with your user account, but only if and after you have logged into your user account on browser 1.

When you visit our website on a different browser (“browser 2"). If you later visit our website on browser 2 (whether on the same device or a different device) and GPC is not enabled, we are unable to apply the prior GPC signal from browser 1 to cookie PI on browser 2, unless and until you login to your user account on browser 2. We will continue to apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-outs communicated via the GPC signal on browser 1.

We process GPC signals in a frictionless manner, which means that we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled GPC; (2) change your experience with our website if you use GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the GPC.

Incentive and Loyalty Programs; Right to Non-Discrimination

Background

Loyalty/Incentive Programs Notice

We also collect and use your personal data to administer and maintain Rewards Programs (defined above in “

How We Gather & Use Personal Data”), which may be considered a “financial incentive” or a “bona fide loyalty program” under one or more of the U.S. Privacy Laws.

We use all categories of personal data disclosed in the above table, excluding “biometric information,” “professional or employment information, and “non-public education records,” to administer and maintain such Rewards Programs. All categories of personal data we use may also be Sold or processed for Targeted Advertising. We may also use, Sell, and process for Targeted Advertising the categories of sensitive personal data: account information and credentials, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, and personal data concerning health. While we may collect sensitive personal data in relation to some Rewards Programs, the collection and processing of sensitive personal data is not required to participate in Rewards Programs. We use personal data to verify your identity, offer unique rewards, track your program status, and to facilitate the exchange of program points for products, promotional materials, training workshops, and other items. The categories of third parties that will receive personal data and sensitive personal data are set forth in the table above, some of which may qualify as data brokers under some of the U.S. Privacy Laws. Some U.S. Privacy Laws require us to state whether we provide Rewards Programs benefits through third-party partners; however, while we sometimes will provide you the opportunity to independently engage with third parties through our websites or apps, third parties do not provide Rewards Programs on our behalf.

You can opt-in to a Rewards Program by signing up on the applicable rewards page. If you opt-in to participate in any of our Rewards Programs, you may withdraw from participation at any time by contacting us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with the instructions set forth in the applicable Rewards Program’s terms and conditions.

Under certain U.S. Privacy Laws, you may be entitled to be informed as to why financial incentive programs, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of your personal data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personal data. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal data collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or benefit provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal data collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the use of such personal data for our marketing and business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Rewards Programs, (iii) the discounted price offered (if any), (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our Rewards Programs, and (v) the product or service to which the Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards. We deem the value of the personal data to be reasonably related to the value of the rewards, and by subscribing to these Rewards Programs you indicate you agree. If you do not, do not subscribe to the Rewards Programs.

Non-Discrimination

You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights described in this U.S. State Privacy Notice. We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services in a manner that is prohibited by the U.S. Privacy Laws if you choose to exercise your rights. Please note, however, that you will no longer be able to participate in Rewards Programs request to delete personal data. This is because we need the personal data collected in relation Rewards Program to carry out the functions described above.

California Shine the Light

We provide California residents with the option to opt-out to sharing of “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, with third parties (other than with Company affiliates) for such third parties’ own direct marketing purposes. California residents may exercise this opt-out, request information about our Shine the Light law compliance, and/or obtain a disclosure of third parties we have shared information with and the categories of information shared. To do so contact us at 1 Procter & Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45202, U.S.A. (Attn: Privacy). You must put the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the body of your correspondence. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. This right is different than, and in addition to, CCPA rights, and must be requested separately. We are only required to respond to one request per Consumer each year. We are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided mail address. We will not accept Shine the Light requests by telephone or by fax, and are not responsible for requests not labeled or sent properly, or that are incomplete.

Background

EEA, UK and Serbia Privacy

This section includes information that is required to be disclosed in respect of our processing of personal data of EEA country, UK and Serbian residents. It aims to provide increased transparency into our processing, retention, and transfer of EEA, UK and Serbian residents personal data that is in line with the letter and spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the GDPR as incorporated into UK law by the Data Protection Act 2018 and amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Certain information, such as the Entities and list of Data Controllers, as well as the legal bases for processing explained under “Processing and Retention” below only apply to processing of personal data of EEA country, UK and Serbia residents. The retention periods described below, however, apply more broadly to personal data of residents of the states described above in the U.S. State Privacy Notice.

Entities

Different P&G entities may be the controller of your personal data. A data controller is the entity which directs the processing activity and is principally responsible for the data. The chart below identifies our data controllers for EEA country, UK and Serbian data. For example, when you register for email on one of our French websites, the P&G entity listed next to that country name will be the controller of that personal data (e.g., Procter & Gamble France SAS).
