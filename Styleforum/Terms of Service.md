STYLEFORUM.NET MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR CONTENT PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES OR THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY COLLECTIVE CONTENT OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM STYLEFORUM.NET OR THROUGH THE SITE, SERVICES OR COLLECTIVE CONTENT, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

**Indemnity**

**Limitation of Liability**

You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the site, services and collective content remains with you. Neither Styleforum nor any other person or entity involved in creating, producing, or delivering the site, services or collective content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or inability to use the site, services or collective content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not styleforum.net has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Styleforum and you.

All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of Styleforum.net used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of Styleforum.net. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.

**Controlling Law and Jurisdiction**

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Idaho without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights will be the state and federal courts located in the Latah County and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

**Entire Agreement**

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Styleforum.net and you regarding the Site, Services and Collective Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Styleforum.net and you regarding the Site, Services and Collective Content.

**ASSIGNMENT**

You may not assign or transfer these terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Styleforum’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Styleforum may assign or transfer these terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

**NOTICES**

Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Styleforum: (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

You and Styleforum agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. _**You acknowledge and agree that you and Styleforum.net are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding**_. Further, unless both you and Styleforum.net otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.

_Arbitration Rules and Governing Law_. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb\_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate form for California residents atwww.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Idaho and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Styleforum otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Styleforum.net submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Styleforum not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.

Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Styleforum.net changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.styleforum.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Styleforum.net’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Styleforum.net in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

**General**

The failure of Styleforum.net to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Styleforum. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
