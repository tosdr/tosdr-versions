5\. Prices, Exchange Rates, and Confirmations
---------------------------------------------

5.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are highly experimental and risky.

5.2. SwapSwop’s conversion service attempts to provide accurate price and exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile and can change quickly without Users necessarily being aware of these changes.

5.3. For normal orders, the exchange rate you receive is calculated at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security between blockchain, your payment is typically considered “accepted” at six blocks confirmation. It is important to note that a payment being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an acceptance by SwapSwop of that payment.

5.4. The SwapSwop’s interest (the SwapSwop’s remuneration for the use of its services and the Website) is included in the final rate of the User’s change transactions. You don’t need to pay additional fees directly to the SwapSwop unless otherwise provided by these Terms.

5.5. Please, contact customer support (support@SwapSwop.io) for more information on exchange rates and prices.

5.6. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the changes you complete via the Website and our services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that SwapSwop is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your exchanges or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any transactions.

6\. Returns and Refund Policy
-----------------------------

6.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are, by their nature, generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly volatile and transitory. We cannot be responsible for any risk in the use of the Website, including but not limited to exchange rate risk and market risk. All sales and transactions after the SwapSwop exchange are final and the amount is non-refundable.

6.2. If an error occurs with a User’s exchange or interfaces on the User’s side of the transaction, the “Order Status” page on the Website will indicate whether or not the failed exchange will result in a refund of the User’s deposited Digital Asset or the outgoing Digital Asset to which the User was exchanging.

6.3. The Digital Asset deposited by the User will be refunded to the User if the “Order Status” page either:

* indicates the exchange failed by displaying a “failed” message; or,
* indicates the exchange got stuck in “awaiting exchange”, “pending confirms” or “awaiting deposit” stages.

6.4. The outgoing Digital Asset will be exchanged and sent to the User if the “Order Status” page indicates a successful exchange by displaying “Done” or “Completed”.

6.5. SwapSwop handles requests from the Users on a case-by-case basis. Any decisions by SwapSwop with respect to refunds or exchanges are final.

6.6. Please, note:

* All transactions from SwapSwop to the User’s outgoing Digital Asset wallet shall be subject to all posted fees, including but not limited to miner fees.
* The Digital Assets extraction process can take up to twenty (20) business days. If the User wishes to expedite this process, additional charges may apply.
* Unsupported Digital Assets that are deposited into our system to unrelated wallets cannot be extracted or returned. SwapSwop reserves the right to handle this on a case-by-case basis. Any decisions by SwapSwop with respect to such Digital Assets being deposited when no longer supported are final.
* Transactions below the minimum limits determined on the Website can not be completed.
* When the User provides a destination address, this is the only address that output funds can be sent to. Any decisions by SwapSwop with respect to refunds in these circumstances are final.
* SwapSwop only accepts one (1) deposit per transaction ID (TXID). If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one (1) deposit, you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange rate will not be honored and your exchange cannot be completed.
* WARNING: There are fake websites pretending to be SwapSwop’s Website (aka “phishing scams”). They use a misspelled URL that looks like “SwapSwop.io” in order to trick the Users into sending them funds. DO NOT USE ANY SERVICE THAT ISN'T EXACTLY LOCATED AT THE DOMAIN: “SwapSwop.io”.

SwapSwop is not responsible for funds that have been sent to these fake phishing sites. It is important that all Users shall verify they are visiting the correct URL ([SwapSwop.io](https://swapswop.io/)) on their own and search for the security certificate in the URL bar of their browser.

Also, never trust private messages, solicitations, or requests for funds from people claiming to be SwapSwop unless you have verified that it is an official request from a SwapSwop’s employee.

In case of doubt, contact us directly to verify any messaging. Stay diligent — and please report any phishing scams to our team (support@swapswop.io).

6.7. If there are dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market, SwapSwop can not exchange Cryptocurrency at a fixed rate. In this case, SwapSwop shall carry out exchange transactions at the market rate or return the Cryptocurrency to the User at the choice of the latter.

The Parties agree that under “dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency market” they understand the changes in the cryptocurrency rates equal to 3% or higher in any direction.

6.8. If there are any changes in the cryptocurrency market and the User decided to take any advantage of the Website's vulnerability, SwapSwop can not complete the exchange transactions of such User and shall return him or her the Cryptocurrency.

6.9. SwapSwop's tech team department is able to refund only BTC from SegWit BTC addresses. No other crypto assets, including but not limited to LTC, BSV, BCH sent to a SegWit BTC address could be refunded.

6.10 Please note that token refunds sent to our ERC-20 address incorrectly may take up to 24 hours.
