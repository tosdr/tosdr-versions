However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.
* **Google Analytics.** We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of our Services.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you use the Services, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visit to or use of the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Services by disabling cookies on your browser.

You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Services and visiting your account profile page.

You may also send us an email at customer.service@coldist.com to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.
