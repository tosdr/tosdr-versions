We strive to display accurate price information, however we may, on occasion, make inadvertent typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any orders arising from such occurrences subject to applicable state alcohol beverage law.
    * Subject to applicable state alcohol beverage laws, we may offer from time to time promotions on the B2B Tools that may affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms.

You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section is null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your obligations under these Terms.
13. No Waivers. The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.

14. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you.
15. Notices.
    * To You. We may provide any notice to you under these Terms by: (i) sending a message to the email address you provide or (ii) by posting to the B2B Tools.

17. Entire Agreement. Our order confirmation, these Terms, our B2B Tools Terms of Use, and our Privacy Policy will be deemed the final and integrated agreement between you and us on the matters contained in these Terms, provided that additional terms in our invoices will govern to the extent they do not conflict with these Terms.
