Welcome to Picker Wheel!
------------------------

These are the terms and conditions for:

> > [https://pickerwheel.com/](https://pickerwheel.com/)  
> > (Hereby “**Picker Wheel**”).

By accessing the website, registering and accessing the services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept all of these Terms, then you may not use our platform and services. In these terms, "we", "us", "our" and "Picker Wheel" refers to Renascence Technology and "you" and “your" refers to you, the user of Picker Wheel.

The following terms and conditions apply to the platform and services offered by Picker Wheel. This includes the mobile and tablet versions as well as any other version of Picker Wheel accessible via desktop, mobile, tablet, social media, or other devices.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING, USING OR OBTAINING ANY MATERIALS, INFORMATION OR SERVICES.

1\. Eligiblity
--------------

You may use the platform only in compliance with these terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

Use of the platform is available to all ages. In the case of minors, it is the responsibility of parents and legal guardians to determine whether use of the platform or any of the content and functionality available in the services and plans is appropriate for their child or minor in custody. Picker Wheel reserves the right to make the necessary checks during the registration process.

You represent and warrant that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; and that your use of the platform does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Picker Wheel may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the platform and services to any user and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the service and the platform is revoked in such jurisdictions.

By using the platform and services, you represent and warrant that you have the full right, power and authority to enter into these terms and to fully perform all of your obligations hereunder. You further represent and warrant that you are under no legal disability or contractual restriction that prevents you from entering into these terms.

By providing Picker Wheel with your email address and phone number you consent to our use of your email address to send you notices about the platform, including those required by law. We may also use your email address and phone number to send you notifications and other messages, such as changes to service features, news, and special content. We will also use your email address to reply to you when you have sent us your feedback through our feedback form. If you do not wish to receive these emails, you may opt-out of receiving them by sending us your withdrawal request via the contact information or by using the "unsubscribe" option in the emails or mobile notifications. Opting out may prevent you from receiving emails about updates, news, or special content.

Users may use the platform without registering. Account registration is required if users wish to save and share their online data with other devices. If the user uses the platform without registering, all data will be saved in the local storage of the user's browser.

2\. Account
-----------

If you register on Picker Wheel, you will be required to choose a password and you may be asked for additional information regarding your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account information, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to immediately notify Picker Wheel of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security and ensure that you log out from your account at the end of each session. You may never use another user’s account without prior authorization from Picker Wheel. Picker Wheel will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this agreement.

Users may cancel their accounts at any time and for any reason by following the instructions on the platform or by sending us their request through our contact information. That termination will only result in the deletion of the account and the deletion of all the personal data granted to Picker Wheel.

Picker Wheel reserves the right to terminate your account or your access immediately, with or without notice to you, and without liability to you, if Picker Wheel believes that you have breached any of these terms, furnished Picker Wheel with false or misleading information, or interfered with use of the platform or the service by others.

3\. Plans
---------

Users will be able to purchase plans that will allow users to access premium functionalities within the platform. When a user makes a purchase of a plan, the user agrees and declares to purchase the plan for the price advertised on the website at the time of purchase. The purchase of the plans is final and non-refundable. Please check the price and features of each plan before ordering.

When a user makes a plan purchase, Picker Wheel will send a confirmation email. This confirmation email will occur automatically so that the user has confirmation of payment and plan initiation. If the user does not receive the confirmation email when purchasing and signing up for the plan, it may have been sent to their spam folder.

Picker Wheel may cancel the sale of any plan and may change or discontinue the availability of plans at any time at its sole discretion. If a plan purchase is cancelled, any payments made for the applicable billing period will be refunded. This does not affect your statutory rights.

Plans may include automatic recurring payments. You authorize Picker Wheel to renew your plan and to charge you periodically and progressively on each billing date. The plan billing date is the date you purchase the plan and make your first payment. On the applicable billing date, you will automatically be charged the applicable plan rate. The plan will remain active until you cancel it or we terminate it. You must cancel your plan before it renews to avoid the next billing period. We will bill you for the plan billing fee in the payment method you choose during plan registration and purchase.

Plans will automatically renew for an additional period unless cancelled before the next billing period. Users will be able to cancel the plan through their user account and control panel. Once the plan is cancelled through the user's account, the plan will continue to be active until the next billing period.

4\. Payments
------------

The plans will be paid through the payment processor available on the website. Payment will be charged to your credit or debit card immediately upon payment of the applicable plan fee. Upon processing a transaction, we will issue an electronic receipt that will be sent to the email address you provided to us at the time you purchased a plan. The email and transaction receipt may be sent through the payment processor available from Picker Wheel.

If you find any inconsistency in your billing, please contact us through our contact information or you can make the claim through the client service of the corresponding payment platform.

If your card is declined, you will receive an error message. No payment will be charged to your card and no order will be processed. There may be a pending transaction on your account until your card issuing bank withdraws the authorization. This usually takes 2 to 5 business days. Your card may be declined for various reasons such as insufficient funds, AVS (Address Verification System) mismatch or you have entered an incorrect security code.

If your payment is declined, you must provide an alternative payment method or provide another card where payment can be charged and processed.

Your payment data will be processed and stored securely and for the sole purpose of processing the purchase of the plans. Picker Wheel reserves the right to contract any payment platform available on the market, which treats your data for the sole purpose of processing the purchase of the plans.
