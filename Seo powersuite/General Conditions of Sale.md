LINK-ASSISTANT.COM REFUND POLICY - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
--------------------------------------------------------

Effective Date of this version: **25 June 2018**

In this document, a buyer/customer is referred to as User, and any software sold by Link-Assistant.Com (including SEO PowerSuite, LinkAssistant, SEO SpyGlass, WebSite Auditor and Rank Tracker) is referred to as Software Product.

**(1.) Subscription Payment.**  

Subscribers must agree to the payment terms presented at the time you sign up for any Software Product. You are responsible for acting prior to renewal if you do not want to renew automatically. You may not receive notice of your renewal after subscribing, and you must visit your 2Checkout account to find out when your subscription renews. Subscriptions recur either monthly or annually in most cases, depending on the renewal term you choose on signup. You must ensure that the credit card information used for your account or subscription is current and accurate, and that you are authorized to use that credit card.

**(2.) Subscription Cancellation.**  

For security, an email or phone call to Link-Assistant.Com is not sufficient to cancel your Software Product subscription. You may cancel at any time by visiting your 2Checkout account and choosing to cancel the subscription. Cancellation does not entitle you to any refund whatsoever. You will continue to have access to the Software Product you have paid for until the end of your subscription term, but will lose access if the subscription is not in good standing.

**(3.) No Refunds.**  

Software Product will not provide you any refunds at any time. If you cancel your subscription, Software Product is not obligated to refund fees for any portion of your subscription term. If you choose to downgrade your subscription during your subscription term, you may be entitled to pay a lower, prorated amount as of the date of renewal, but you are not entitled to any refund at any time.
