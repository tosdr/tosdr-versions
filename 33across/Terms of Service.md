We operate the Site, and 33Across software products and services made available through the Site (collectively the “Services”), as well as our platform (the “33Across Platform”). The following terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) form a binding agreement between you and us whether you are a visitor to this Site (a “Visitor”), an individual who is accessing and using the 33Across Platform from a Supply Partner website (an “End User”) or the owner or operator of a website that installs the Services on its website (a “Supply Partner” and the website a “Supply Partner Site”). Unless otherwise indicated, “you” means Visitors, End Users and Supply Partners.

5\. PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY. Supply Partner is responsible for ensuring that it is in full compliance with the applicable Data Protection Authority’s interpretation of E-PRIVACY DIRECTIVE 2009/136/EC and all applicable laws and regulations regarding the posting of privacy policies and the collection, use and disclosure of the offline data. You are responsible for providing a link to opt out of personalized advertising, such as optout.networkadvertising.org. Each party will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and self-regulatory organization codes including, without limitation, the National Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct. To the extent the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR ) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is applicable to the Parties’ activities under this Agreement, each Party will ensure its services and business practices comply with the GDPR no later than the date on which it comes into effect, and will adhere to the Data Processing Addendum attached as Addendum A hereto and incorporate into these Terms of Use.

6\. OWNERSHIP AND 33ACROSS LICENSES. You understand and acknowledge that the software, code, proprietary methods and systems used to provide the Site or Services and any Downloadable Code (as defined below) (“Our Technology”), are: (i) protected by United States and international copyright laws; (ii) subject to other intellectual property and proprietary rights and laws; and (iii) owned by us or our licensors. Subject to the terms of this Terms of Use, we hereby grant to Supply Partner a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use and reproduce the code provided by us that enables the installation of Services on your Supply Partner Site (the “Downloadable Code”).
