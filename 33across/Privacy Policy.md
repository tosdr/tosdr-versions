Ready to Solve the Cookieless Puzzle?
-------------------------------------

[Get Started Now](https://www.33across.co.uk/contact/)

Of all the cookieless solutions we have tested, Lexicon is the only solution that has led to a substantial revenue lift across our unaddressable inventory. If we could utilize this technology across all of our supply-side platforms, we would be in a much better place to prepare for the end of third-party cookies.

Joshua Mendelssohn, Co-Founder

Our focus has been to drive loyal audiences to our suite of web properties; however, we’ve begun to see our cookieless outpace our cookied inventory due to an influx of traffic from embedded and non-cookied browsers. Lexicon has proven integral to transforming our cookieless supply into programmatic revenue without any technical lift.

Ziv Jonas, Co-Founder

We immediately saw an impressive increase in our cookieless revenue once we deployed 33Across’ Lexicon. What makes Lexicon unique from other identity solutions are the insights into the revenue impact of our unaddressable supply. As we navigate a complex time, we appreciate the team’s knowledge and transparency on how to optimize our cookieless performance.

Kevin Antoine, Programmatic & Business Development Lead

Lexicon has immediately proven how cookieless inventory can be a major revenue driver for us. The Arena Group has seen a massive improvement in unaddressable revenue with higher fill and CPMs. Unaddressable revenue has become a large part of our monetization strategy with 33Across, helping us seamlessly navigate the complexities of cookieless monetization.

Megan HongSr. Manager, Partner & Yield Management

The 33Across team came up with a strategic rollout plan to optimize and fully monetize our cookieless supply. Using Lexicon, we were able to see a nearly 1000% increase in cookieless fill rates and a 350% increase in cookieless revenue across Q3.

Andre WoodyHead of Display Advertising

We’ve been looking for a solution that helps monetize cookieless traffic. After implementing Lexicon we were surprised to see great immediate results from our buyers who are using the technology. Within the first week, our cookieless revenue increased by 50% and our bid rate activity jumped. Historically, we haven’t seen such a distinct change when we add a new identity module.
