Privacy policy

[](#privacy-policy)

[ðŸŒŽ Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FM66B%2FFairEmail%2Fmaster%2FPRIVACY.md)

  

This privacy policy will be updated as needed, such as when there are changes in the app or when regulations or laws change.

Last update: **June 2, 2024**

  

First of all, FairEmail's main goal is to help you protect your privacy. What follows is a complete overview of all the data that will be stored on the device and that **can be** sent to the internet. The latter is in the end always your choice and therefore optional.

Except for error reports (disabled by default), the app does not send any data to the developer. Error reports will automatically be deleted after one month, or earlier upon request.

Data collected on the device will **never** be sold or shared in any way.

Data collected on the device will **never** be used for profiling, (AI) training or advertisements.

There are **no ads** in the app.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory data protection authority, please [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_data_protection_authority) for a list.

  

The [data safety](https://play.google.com/store/apps/datasafety?id=eu.faircode.email) in the Play Store says:

"_The developer says this app doesn't share user data with other companies or organizations._".

Unfortunately, there is no way to say that the app doesn't share data with the developer. Except for error reporting (explicitly opt-in) **no data will be shared with the developer**. It is important to note that collecting data on the device isn't synonymous with sending data off the device!

  

### Overview

[](#overview)

FairEmail **does not** send account information and message data elsewhere than to your email provider.

FairEmail **does not** allow other apps access to message data without your approval.

FairEmail **does not** require unnecessary permissions. For more information on permissions, see [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq1).

FairEmail **does** use modern and secure transport protocols by default.

Android [encrypts all user data by default](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption), so all data, including account credentials, is stored encrypted by default.

FairEmail **does** follow the recommendations of [this EFF article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/stop-tracking-my-emails).

FairEmail is 100 % **open source**, see [the license](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/blob/master/LICENSE).

Error reporting via Bugsnag **is opt-in**, see [here](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq104) for more information.

FairEmail **adheres** to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the [Limited Use requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes). Google API Services are used only to authenticate Gmail accounts through OAuth.

The use of information received from Gmail APIs will adhere to the Google User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements."

All stored information (account details, messages, etc.) is **protected by encryption**. All information is sent and received through **secure connections**. Of course, you should also protect your device by using a PIN code, pattern and/or biometric authentication.

FairEmail **can use** these services if they are explicitly enabled (off by default) or are explicitly used by you:

FairEmail **can access** the websites at the domain names of email addresses ([username@domain.name](mailto:username@domain.name)) if [Brand Indicators for Message Identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_Indicators_for_Message_Identification) (BIMI) or [favicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) were explicitly enabled (off by default).

FairEmail **will access** the website at the link address if you tap the _Fetch title_ button in the insert link dialog (from version 1.1905).

FairEmail obviously **will access** the configured email servers.

FairEmail **is** [GDPR compliant](https://gdpr.eu/).

Also, when downloading content, like images and files, the [browser's user agent string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) will be sent. There is a privacy option to minimize the information being sent, but please be aware that this can result in problems in some cases.

### A. General information on data processing

[](#a-general-information-on-data-processing)

#### I. Scope of personal data processing

[](#i-scope-of-personal-data-processing)

This privacy policy / data protection declaration applies to the Android app FairEmail.

The data processor only processes personal data insofar as absolutely required for providing a functioning email client as well as the explicitly requested services. Users' personal data is usually only processed if required for fulfilling contractual or legal obligations or with the user's consent.

#### II Purpose of data processing

[](#ii-purpose-of-data-processing)

The purpose of any data processed is to provide you with the service requested. The app by default exclusively processes data that is necessary for the proper functioning of the app and its intended purpose of being an email client.

#### III. Data storage and data deletion

[](#iii-data-storage-and-data-deletion)

By default, all data (both personal and non-personal) remains on the data subject's Android device for as long as not explicitly sent or shared by the data subject. The data stored on the data subject's device can be deleted by the data subject at any time.

#### IV. Sub-processors

[](#iv-sub-processors)

The services of all sub-processors are disabled by default. The data subject's data is sent to and processed by sub-processors if and only if explicitly enabled or requested by the data subject.

The sub-processors are:

* [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) â€“ [Privacy policy](https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/)

#### V. Permissions

[](#v-permissions)

The app only requests permissions that are necessary for the expected behavior of an email app. For more information on permissions, see [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq1).

#### VI. Logging

[](#vi-logging)

The app does not send any log entries to the data processor by default. The error reporting system utilizes Bugsnag and is disabled by default. See [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq104) for more information.

#### VII. Legal basis

[](#vii-legal-basis)

FairEmail is fully [GDPR compliant](https://gdpr.eu/). The legal basis for any data processing is Art. 6 (1) a - c GDPR.

  

### B. Support requests

[](#b-support-requests)

#### I. Description and scope of data processing

[](#i-description-and-scope-of-data-processing)

The data subject may contact the data processor to request support through channels offered by the data processor. When the data subject contacts the data processor, any provided personal data is stored by the data controller.

#### II. Purpose of data processing

[](#ii-purpose-of-data-processing-1)

The personal data is exclusively processed for finding a specific solution to support queries whilst recording and/or processing them. It is essential in this respect for the data controller to be able to contact the person requesting support.

#### III. Sub-processors

[](#iii-sub-processors)

The data processor utilizes the services of the following sub-processors in order to process support requests:

* Google LLC, if support request sent via email â€“ [Privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)
* Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, if support request sent via the contact form â€“ [Privacy policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)

#### IV. Legal basis

[](#iv-legal-basis)

Any support requests are sent voluntarily by the data subject, including any personal data that might be attached. As such, the explicit consent as outlined in Art. 6 (1) a GDPR forms the legal basis for processing.
