Generally speaking, the cookie contains certain directly or indirectly identifying information, such as the name

of the server that deposited it, a session identifier, an expiry date, or even information on navigation within the

site you are visiting, such as the pages you have visited, for example, a terminal identifier, an advertising

identifier, etc.



Cookies have many uses: they can be used to remember your advertising ID, the contents of your shopping cart,

the language in which the web page is displayed, to track your browsing for statistical or advertising purposes,

to personalise content etc. For the sake of simplicity, we use the term cookies to refer to all types of tracers.



2) Who can place cookies on my terminal?

prevention service providers or our partners' clients. You can consult the list of partners (also available via the

cookie management platform).



Cookies may be deposited when you browse our Platform or when you click on our advertising spaces from our

Platform or partner sites.



3) How do I set my cookies?

are used and to give you the possibility of accepting or refusing cookies related to (i) audience measurement,

(ii) content customisation, (iii) personalised advertising and (iv) sharing on social networks.



Once you have made your choices, a necessary cookie is placed on your terminal in order to keep them in

memory for 6 months. This prevents us from asking you to set your cookies each time you visit our Platform.



If you wish to change these settings at a later date, you must empty your browser's cache so that the banner

appears again or access the cookie management platform.

To facilitate your request, we ask you to write us from the email address you used to create your account on the

Platform. Otherwise, we would not be able to verify your identity (or verify that you are the person who holds the

account for which you wish to activate your rights). In this case, we may ask you to prove your identity by

completing a form and providing a copy of an official identity document.



Important information on identity checks: In case of doubt or to fight fraud, we may ask you for proof of

identity, address, purchase/sale or bank card. We will tell you how to provide us with these documents so that

only the information we strictly need is transmitted to us (e.g.: copy of the identity card in black and white,

photograph of part of a document, etc.). Only the departments that need to see these documents will process

your data. We only keep these documents for the time necessary to verify them and then delete them

immediately.
