Generally speaking, the cookie contains certain directly or indirectly identifying information, such as the name  of the server that deposited it, a session identifier, an expiry date, or even information on navigation within the  site you are visiting, such as the pages you have visited, for example, a terminal identifier, an advertising  identifier, etc. 

Cookies have many uses: they can be used to remember your advertising ID, the contents of your shopping cart,  the language in which the web page is displayed, to track your browsing for statistical or advertising purposes,  to personalise content etc. For the sake of simplicity, we use the term cookies to refer to all types of tracers. 

2) Who can place cookies on my terminal?

3) How do I set my cookies?

1. a) The Vestiaire Collective banner

Once you have made your choices, a necessary cookie is placed on your terminal in order to keep them in  memory for 6 months. This prevents us from asking you to set your cookies each time you visit our Platform.  

If you wish to change these settings at a later date, you must empty your browser's cache so that the banner  appears again or access the cookie management platform.

Prior to any transfer outside the EU, Vestiaire Collective has ensured that:  

(i) the destination countries provide an adequate level of protection for personal data recognized by the  European Commission; or 

(ii) appropriate safeguards have been adopted (for example, by signing, with the recipient, the standard  contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or authorized by a supervisory authority).  

As of the date of the update of the Policy, the non-EU countries concerned are: the United States of America,  the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Madagascar, Australia, Israel.

**12\. Y****our rights**

In accordance with the GDPR, you have the following rights:  

\- a right of access and rectification allowing you to modify, complete or update your personal data; 

\- a right of deletion of inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, outdated data, or whose collection, use,  communication or storage is prohibited; 

\- a right to object to the processing of your data for legitimate reasons; 

\- a right to object, without any reason, to the use of your data for prospecting purposes; - a right to define directives concerning the fate of your personal data after your death.

\- a right to data portability, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format; however, this right  can only be exercised (i) with respect to the data concerning you that you have provided, as well as (ii) with  respect to automated processing;  

\- a right to the limitation of processing, under the terms and conditions referred to in Article 18 of European  Regulation No. 2016/679 of 27 April 2016; 

\- the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority (the Commission Nationale de  l'Informatique et des Libertés - the "CNIL"). 

To exercise your rights - excluding your right to lodge a complaint with the CNIL - you are invited to contact us via our **[Privacy portal](https://api.dastra.eu/v1/client/customer-subject-form?id=406&key=n9tdbOdLDiWBC3FvcEnfbC1eL6QBV3FbqWDyJSAnbB)**.

 We will respond to your request by email  as soon as possible and at the latest within one (1) month (subject to the longer deadlines provided for by the  GDPR). 

To facilitate your request, we ask you to write us from the email address you used to create your account on the  Platform. Otherwise, we would not be able to verify your identity (or verify that you are the person who holds the  account for which you wish to activate your rights). In this case, we may ask you to prove your identity by  completing a form and providing a copy of an official identity document. 

**Important information on identity checks:** In case of doubt or to fight fraud, we may ask you for proof of  identity, address, purchase/sale or bank card. We will tell you how to provide us with these documents so that  only the information we strictly need is transmitted to us (e.g.: copy of the identity card in black and white,  photograph of part of a document, etc.). Only the departments that need to see these documents will process  your data. We only keep these documents for the time necessary to verify them and then delete them  immediately.
