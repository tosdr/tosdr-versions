However, Blackbaud does reserve the right to monitor such use at any time as it deems appropriate and to remove any materials that, in Blackbaud’s sole discretion, may be illegal, may subject Blackbaud to liability, may violate these Terms of Use, or are, in the sole discretion of Blackbaud, inconsistent with Blackbaud’s purpose for this Website.

No Blackbaud Editorial Control of Third Party Content; No Statement as to Accuracy – To the extent that any of the Content included in the Website is provided by third party content providers or other Website users, Blackbaud has no editorial control or responsibility over such Content.

We strongly urge you to read our Website Privacy Policy.

**Acceptable Use Policy for Forums and Blogs** – Our website contains blogs and forums (collectively, “Forums”) that permit users to post comments. Please remember that the open and real-time nature of the comments posted to these Forums makes it is impossible for Blackbaud to confirm the validity of any content posted. As such, we are not responsible for any messages posted or the consequences of following any advice offered within Forum posts. The views expressed in such posts belong solely to their respective authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Blackbaud. If you find any posts in these Forums to be offensive or objectionable, please contact us via email to the address offered as a contact for the relevant Forum. If we determine that removal of a post or posts is necessary, we will make reasonable efforts to do so in a timely manner.

By using these Forums, you agree to the following:

* By posting messages, uploading files, inputting data, or engaging in any other form of communication through the Forums (collectively, the “content”), you grant Blackbaud, its successors and assignees, a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to use, adapt, transmit, publicly perform or display any such content on the site to which it was contributed (or successor site). In plain English, you allow us to continue to display your contributions to the website.
* If you contribute any graphic images or photographs, you accept all liability for any issues that may arise from such content. Please do not submit any images or photographs for which you do not have a current model or property release unless you are otherwise authorized to post such material.
* You will not post any material that is knowingly false, misleading, or inaccurate.
* You will not behave in an abusive and/or hateful manner, and will not harass, threaten, nor attack anyone.
* You will not use profanity in our Forums, and will neither post with language or content that is obscene, sexually oriented, or sexually suggestive nor link to sites that contain such content.
* You will respect other people’s right to personal privacy and will not post any other person’s identifying information (including their names, contact information or any other relevant information) within the Forum but your own.
* You will not use these Forums to violate any laws nor to discuss illegal activities.
* You will not impersonate any person or entity, forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any posting, nor collect or store personal data about other users.
* You will not post any copyrighted material, nor link to any copyrighted material (with the exception of publicly available sites and pages that the legal owners of the copyrights have created to make that material freely available to the general public), unless that copyright is owned by you or by these Forums.
* You will not use these Forums for the purposes of sharing or distributing viruses, licenses, registration information, software keys, “cracks,” or other information designed to do harm to or allow unlawful access to any computer hardware, software, networks, or any other systems.
* You will not post advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or solicitations, all of which are inappropriate and prohibited in the Forums. You will not, furthermore, collect personal information about Forum members for the purpose of sending them any such advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or solicitations through other means (email, messaging programs, etc.).
* You will not post messages that are clearly outside of the stated topic of any Forums nor disrupt a Forum by deliberately posting repeated irrelevant messages or copies of identical messages (also known as “flooding”).
* You will not attempt to access any protected sections of the sites or Forums, nor make use of any hacks, cracks, bug exploits, etc. to bypass or modify the features of the Forum software at any Blackbaud site.
* You will, if asked by a representative of the Forums, cease posting any content, and/or links to content, deemed offensive, objectionable, or in poor taste by the staff of the Forums.

We do not and cannot review all of the content of every message posted and do not accept responsibility for the content of any messages. We reserve the right to delete any message and/or restrict posting rights in our Forums for any reason whatsoever. Should you continue to post messages that violate the rules of the Forums, your account may be terminated, your access to the Forums may be banned, and your service provider(s) may be contacted about your behaviour. Furthermore, we expressly reserve our rights under the law to take any other actions we deem necessary.
