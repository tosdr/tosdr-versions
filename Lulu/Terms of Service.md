### 6\. Copyright

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.

If you upload content to Lulu you authorize Lulu to act as your agent to issue takedown notices under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) and/or any other similar legislation that allows for the submission of requests to Internet service providers for the removal of infringing or allegedly infringing copyright materials that are contained in or displayed on such service provider’s platforms and/or services. You will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing your rights; however, if Lulu becomes aware of infringement in any form, Lulu may, in its sole discretion, elect to issue takedown notices under the DMCA or similar legislation.

If you believe in good faith that content used or displayed on the Site infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Lulu a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [http://www.copyright.gov/](http://www.copyright.gov/) for details. DMCA notices and counter-notices regarding the Site should be sent to:

### 7\. Publishing With Lulu

Published Content (Content) available through Lulu is defined as a product made available for sale. This includes the Lulu Bookstore, retail partners engaged in our Global Distribution service, and users publishing with any Lulu App. Content (defined in Section 3) published with Lulu creates a PDF file for print or an EPUB file for ebook. You retain ownership of this Content and direct how Lulu makes this Content available to consumers.

Lulu's Global Distribution service supplies Content to third-party retailers. The individual retailer controls whether or not to present Content Lulu provides for sale on the retailer platform. Lulu shall not be liable for failure by the third-party retailer to list any titles for sale nor shall Lulu be liable for any service interruptions on third-party platforms. Authors can choose to opt-out of retailer channels at any time and at their discretion. Lulu sends the Author’s request for content removal on a routine scheduled basis. However, Lulu cannot dictate the speed at which the third-party retail channel removes the titles for sale. Moreover, Lulu cannot guarantee extraordinary means to remove content outside the routine process.

For more information about Global Distribution, please reference Appendix A and Appendix B at the end of this agreement.

Where Lulu operates a direct-to-consumer online retail platform, including the Lulu Bookstore and any other retail Apps, listing Content will be at Lulu's sole discretion.

Lulu reserves the right to distribute published Content in any form of media, including printed media, in order to promote (a) the author or author’s Work and/or (b) the Lulu service. This Content will be licensed for free, non-commercial use, duplication, and sharing.

Lulu makes no guarantees that your Content will be sold.

    * Electronic - for sales of electronic material, 90% of Gross Profit

All sales and payment information is available in your Lulu Account. This includes sales made through retailers participating in Global Distribution and through the Lulu Bookstore.

When creating or editing a Payee, you will choose to receive Creator Revenues payable to you via PayPal or via paper check. PayPal payments may be made in EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, or USD. All paper check payments are made in USD.

**If you choose to receive the Creator Revenue via paper check:** Lulu will make reasonable efforts to make payments to a Payee, and the user acknowledges they are responsible for maintaining accurate Payee payment information within their Lulu account. You will be paid on a quarterly basis once the account balance reaches the minimum threshold for payment. Specifically, no later than 45 days following the end of the calendar quarter, Lulu will make a good faith effort to pay you the quarter-end Creator Revenue account balance using the Payee information in our records that you have provided. Should a payment remain unclaimed or not deposited by a Payee for 180 days, Lulu reserves the right to void said payment and reinstate the payment amount in your account. _Future payments will be delayed until you correct the payment information in your account_. 

**If you choose to receive your payment of Creator Revenue via PayPal:** Lulu will make reasonable efforts to make payments to a Payee, and the user acknowledges they are responsible for maintaining accurate Payee payment information within their Lulu account. You will be paid on a monthly basis once the account balance reaches the minimum threshold for payment. Specifically, no later than the end of the following calendar month, Lulu will make a good faith effort to pay you the month-end Creator Revenue account balance using the Payee information _you have provided_. Should a payment remain unclaimed, Lulu reserves the right to void said payment 25 days after the payment attempt, _and future payments will be delayed until you correct the payment information in your account_.

It is your responsibility to maintain accurate Payee information. If our payment attempts are unsuccessful for more than two years, we may consider that you have chosen to discontinue your relationship with Lulu. We may classify your account as dormant (inactive) and charge a termination fee and deduct this from your Creator Revenue account balance to cover administrative costs. Unsuccessful payment attempts are a result of uncashed or undeliverable checks and denied or unclaimed PayPal payments; Lulu may notify the Payee in these situations. Unsuccessful payment attempts may also be the result of incomplete Payee information. Lulu is not responsible for incomplete or inaccurate Payee information that may result in delays or lack of payment.

US taxpayers are required to provide Lulu with a valid name and address. Additionally, we suggest providing a valid US tax id number. Further, US income taxes will be withheld (“backup withholding”) on Creator Revenue Royalties income unless a valid W-9 form is provided.

For non-US taxpayers, a valid name and valid address is required. US taxes will be withheld at the highest rate required on Creator Revenue Royalties income unless a valid non-US taxpayer id number is provided and a valid W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E form is provided. Once a valid tax form is received by Lulu, US taxes will be withheld at tax treaty rates.

Due to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, we are required to file forms 1099-MISC (for US residents) and 1042S (non-US residents) for each payee to whom we paid royalties during the year. A copy of the form will be made available electronically via a third-party provider, requiring the payee to register with them and opt in to electronic delivery. Unless a payee explicitly opts into electronic delivery, a paper copy will be mailed to the payee’s address we have on record. Payees have the ability to register for electronic delivery at https://www.viewmyforms.com using the contact email address associated with their Payee.

You are responsible for any taxes, fees, and penalties associated with your receipt of Creator Revenue. You agree to indemnify Lulu for any such tax, fee, or penalty.

You are responsible to any third party for payment of Creator Revenue, commissions, etc. that may be owed to them by you based upon agreements you have made with a third party and/or liabilities you have incurred to third parties. Lulu is only responsible for making a good faith attempt to pay Creator Revenue based on sales data gathered by Lulu and using the Payee information you provide. 

Lulu reserves the right to place a hold on any payment or remove Creator Revenue based upon suspicious activity, including but not limited to, potential fraud, copyright infringement, claims by third parties and/or questions regarding rightful ownership of the account, or other violations of these Terms.

### 11\. Promotions

In addition to these Terms, any contests, sweepstakes, surveys, games, or similar promotions (“Promotion” or “Offer”) made available through the Site may be governed by specific rules that are separate from this Agreement. By participating in any such Promotion, you will become subject to those rules, which may vary from the Terms set forth herein. You are solely responsible for reviewing and agreeing to any specific rules applicable to a particular Promotion, which will be linked from such Promotion and to review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.lulu.com/privacy-policy) that, in addition to these Terms, governs any information you submit in connection with such activities. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules conflict with these Terms, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. 

In addition, Promotions are generally subject to the following rules and restrictions, though Lulu reserves the right to amend, update, change, or eliminate these Promotion rules at our sole discretion:

* Each promotional Offer claim code can be used only once.
    
* Limit one Offer per account.
    
* The Offer must be redeemed at our Site toward the purchase of products sold by Lulu. If Lulu is not the seller, that fact will be noted.

* The Offer cannot be used to pay for special-order titles, taxes, or shipping and handling charges.
    
* If the Offer has a minimum purchase requirement, taxes and shipping and handling charges do not apply toward the minimum purchase amount.

* Some offers may not be combined with other Offers in the same order. Generally, only one promotional claim code may be used per order.

When you redeem an Offer, Lulu can tell that you are part of a select group of customers to whom the promotional code was sent or distributed. For more information about data that Lulu collects, please read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.lulu.com/privacy-policy).

Lulu reserves the right to refuse to pay any Creator Revenue where we find, in our sole discretion, that you have abused our promotions and/or other processes to garner Creator Revenue by manipulation and/or other fraudulent and abusive techniques. If we find such activity to have occurred, we reserve the right to terminate your account and withhold all Creator Revenue payments.

### 12\. Returns

A print-on-demand item is manufactured when the order is received. Due to the nature of the print-on-demand manufacturing process, we do not accept returns on physical products. We may not require that damaged physical products be returned to us, nor do we guarantee returns will be accepted. Refunds are issued at our sole discretion.

IF YOU RECEIVE A BOOK THAT IS DAMAGED, WE WILL PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT COPY AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION BASED UPON PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF SAID DAMAGE.

Because Lulu provides creator-controlled publishing tools, Lulu cannot and does not accept responsibility for the quality of the Content hosted and/or purchased (including misspelled words, grammatical errors, factual errors, poor quality images, etc.), the Content’s formatting, design or overall appearance. The creator approves the visual presentation and bears responsibility for its quality. Lulu's staff does not monitor or check individual Content prior to publication or sale through the Site.

### 13\. Retiring Content, Termination of Membership, and Data and Content Retention Policies

You may choose at any time to Retire (remove) your published Content on Lulu. Should you do so, the Content will not be visible to other users and will not be available for sale on the Lulu Bookstore. Retired Content will be deleted from Lulu’s database after a defined period of time, as set forth in the then-current policies of Lulu.

Retiring Content that is part of our Global Distribution service includes additional stipulations; (a) this process will take several business days before the retailer takes any action, and (b) your Content may still be listed by the retailer and, © while not available for sale, it may continue to be listed and shown as “unavailable,” “out of stock,” or similar by the retailer in perpetuity.

Gross Profit received by Lulu prior to the retailer removing your retired Content will continue to be subject to the Terms and Creator Revenue and shall be paid to you when applicable.

Unpublished (Draft) content can be deleted by you. Deleted draft content is removed from Lulu’s database after a defined period of time, as set forth in the then-current policies of Lulu.

You may terminate your membership by navigating to My Account > Account Settings > Account Management; or by contacting Lulu Support with a specific request to do so. Your request to terminate will become effective within 30 days after the acknowledgment by Lulu of the receipt of your request. All terms above regarding retiring or deleting Content continue to be applicable.

Lulu will retain any part of your Personal Data for as long as is reasonably required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. Data retained in backups will be removed only as the backups are purged in the normal course of Lulu’s backup procedures.

Your Content will only remain accessible for defined periods of time, depending on the type of Content (quarantined, retired, draft, previous version, private access, years without sales, etc.). This type of Content will be deleted from Lulu’s database after a defined period of time, as set forth in the then-current policies of Lulu.

You will not do anything to intentionally prejudice the rights granted hereunder, but in the event that you lose any rights or other licenses, consents, or permissions relating to specific Content that is necessary for you to grant the rights you grant to us hereunder, or you receive notice of a third-party claim relating to Content which you reasonably deem to be of concern, you will immediately retire or delete such Content from our Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the rights to the Content that you provide to us under this Agreement. Without limiting our rights or remedies under this Agreement, you will reimburse us for any refunds we make to Customers as a result of the withdrawal of Content under this Section. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph is intended to relieve you of your indemnification obligation above.

### 21\. Jurisdictional Issues

The Site is controlled and operated by Lulu in the United States of America, and is not intended to subject Lulu to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory other than that of the United States of America. Lulu does not represent or warrant that the Site or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules, and regulations. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and at our sole discretion.

Lulu makes no representation that material on the Site is appropriate to or available at locations outside of the United States. You may not use the Site or export the Contents in violation of United States export regulations. If you access this Site from a location outside of the United States, you are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws and payment of any local taxes that may be payable in connection with any purchase from the Site.

### 22\. Miscellaneous

This Agreement shall be construed under and governed by the internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of North Carolina or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of North Carolina.

By using the Site, you agree that any dispute that cannot be settled by good-faith negotiation shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The location of the arbitration shall be Raleigh, North Carolina. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator with experience in computer/technology matters and in the publishing industry. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be legally binding, shall not be subject to appeal, and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Lulu each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and Lulu each waive any right to a jury trial. You or Lulu may bring suit in court on an individual basis only, and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, to apply for injunctive remedies.

The Terms in Sections 16, 17, 18, and 19 relating to disclaimer of warranties, limitations of liability, indemnification, and intellectual property shall survive termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the arbitration requirement above, you agree to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal Court in the State of North Carolina, and Lulu has the right to seek additional remedies, including but not limited to injunctive relief, to enforce the aforementioned clauses or any other material provision of this Agreement.

Except for delay in payments due, if anything happens that is beyond the reasonable control of either party, then delays will be expected and performance may be excused. Lulu and its subcontractors or suppliers shall not be liable for any delay caused by the occurrence of such an event beyond their reasonable control.

This Agreement does not designate either party as the agent, employee, legal representative, partner, or joint venturer of the other party for any purpose.

References to businesses in connection with Lulu’s operations refer to organizations with which Lulu has business relationships and does not imply formal legal partnerships.

Every term of this Agreement is intended to be severable. If any term of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then such term will be deemed amended and interpreted, if possible, in a way that renders it enforceable. If such an interpretation is not possible, then the term will be deemed removed from this Agreement and the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operated as a waiver of any right or remedy.

This is the entire agreement between you and Lulu relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.

These Terms are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent.

These Terms may not be modified or amended except with our prior written consent.

Any heading, caption, or section title contained in these Terms is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.

If you have any questions or comments regarding these Terms, please contact: [\[email protected\]](https://www.lulu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Beta Services may be provided for evaluation or testing purposes, and, therefore, may contain bugs or errors, and may not be as reliable as other features of the Site.

Appendix A: ISBN Agreement
--------------------------

Lulu will be the sole source of bibliographic data on your book. Lulu will provide data to the US ISBN Agency as well as to Bowker's Books In Print ® and other industry databases. This data will identify Lulu.com as the publisher. You accept that Lulu.com is the publisher of record and that any creator revenue you earn through this ISBN meets the true & legal definition of the term 'royalty'. You accept that Lulu.com as the publisher is legally obligated to report all revenue you earn through for sales of the title associated with this ISBN to the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under the following conditions: 

1. For domestic US individuals or business entities, ALL revenue you earn through this ISBN, regardless of the ship-to address or final destination must be reported.
    
2. For Non-Resident Alien individuals or business entities, any revenue you earn through this ISBN for books that are shipped to a US address will be considered US Sourced Income and must be reported.
    

You agree to provide Lulu.com with your complete tax information to facilitate the tax reporting mentioned above. You also agree that if you do not provide this completed tax documentation, the revenue you earn through this ISBN will be subject to backup withholding.

Domestic US individuals or entities must provide a completed, signed W-9 form with a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN for businesses). If a domestic US individual or entity has a valid W-9 form on file with Lulu then there will be no withholding tax deducted from the revenue you earn from sales of the title associated with this ISBN. If a domestic US individual or entity does NOT have a valid W-9 form on file with Lulu, the revenue you earn through this ISBN will be subject to the default backup withholding rate for domestic entities.

Non-Resident individuals or entities must provide a completed, signed W-8BEN form with a valid Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) or Employer Identification Number (EIN for businesses). If a Non-Resident individual or entity has a valid W-8BEN form on file with Lulu, then US Sourced royalties that you earn from sales of the title associated with this  ISBN will be subject to the withholding tax rate specified in the taxation treaty between the US and the country you specify on line 9A of your W-8BEN form, if such a treaty exists. If a Non-Resident individual or entity does NOT have a valid W-8BEN form on file with Lulu then the US Sourced royalties that you earn through this ISBN will be subject to the default backup withholding rate for Non-Resident entities. Any US taxation treaty that specifically addresses, is documented, and directly conflicts with this structure will supersede these general rules.

### Bring Your Own ISBN

By assigning your ISBN to a title published through the Site, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and agree to the U.S. ISBN Agency terms and conditions listed below:

1. An ISBN will be assigned to this title and the publisher name that you have provided will be listed as the publisher in all bibliographic feeds.
    
2. Lulu will function as an agent providing distribution services.
    

### Lulu ISBN (Free)

By assigning an ISBN provided by Lulu you are agreeing to the following terms:

1. You are granting rights to Lulu to act as a publisher on your behalf to retailers and wholesalers globally.
    
2. Lulu will assign an ISBN to the title and Lulu.com will be listed as the publisher in all bibliographic feeds.
    

Appendix B: Global Distribution Agreement
-----------------------------------------

If you select Global Distribution for your published project, these terms apply in addition to the Terms listed above and serve to supplement Section 7 of the Terms. 

Global Distribution makes a print or ebook (referred to hereafter as “Content”) available to retail sites and retail catalogs (referred to hereafter as “Channel” or “Distributor”). 

Published Content that complies with all distribution requirements is eligible for distribution to the Channels you select during the publishing process. For any Channel you select, Lulu becomes the exclusive means by which you provide that Content to that Channel.

You will ensure that your Content and any revisions meet the Lulu distribution requirements in their most current state. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update, amend, or otherwise change the requirements to comply with Distributor requirements. 

You acknowledge that you cannot change the title, subtitle, author name, book size, binding type, and interior color once the Content is approved for distribution; changing these items constitutes a new publication and requires creating a new book or ebook.

Retiring your project will prompt its automated removal from Global Distribution. Distributors may take up to 8 weeks to remove your Content from their sales channels. For some Distributors, total removal of your Content may not be possible and Lulu has no influence in these situations and cannot take action. 

We rely on you to contact Lulu regarding questions on channel rejection status or manner of channel listing. 

### What Lulu Does

We will provide the files and metadata of your Content and any revision to the Channels with which Lulu has a direct or indirect relationship, at our sole discretion; Content must meet the distribution requirements in their most current state, and comply with both the Lulu Terms and any terms, restrictions, or other guidelines provided by the Distributors.

### Distributors

The Distributors are not parties to the Lulu Terms or the Global Distribution Agreement and are under no obligation to accept your Content. 

At their discretion and without providing a warning to you or Lulu, Distributors may apply a discount to the list price of your Content. 

The Distributors are not responsible for the way your Content renders, in print or electronic format, regardless of the device used.

### Ebook Distribution

In addition to the Terms and Global Distribution Agreement, the following applies only to ebooks.

Before an ebook is accepted for Global Distribution, you agree to pay a one-time retail distribution fee upon the first submission of a new ebook to our Global Distribution service. This fee will be collected prior to completing the publication process. This fee does not apply to revisions of a published ebook.

Distributors offering ebooks may operate on a subscription basis, under which a user may access up to twenty percent of your Content before a sale is recorded.

### Print Book Distribution

In addition to the Terms and Global Distribution Agreement, the following applies only to print books.

Before a print book is accepted for Global Distribution, you agree to purchase a single copy (proof copy) of your Content or revision and approve that version. 

Lulu and/or the Distributors do not guarantee the quality of content that is printed. Lulu and/or the Distributors do not guarantee that your project specifications as submitted to Lulu will exactly match the specifications printed by the Distributor. 

Lulu and/or the Distributors are not responsible for or control any third-party resellers of your Content.

### Suspension Of Global Distribution

We may suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of the Global Distribution service immediately without notice to you if we determine:

* Your use of the Global Distribution service (a) poses a security risk to Lulu or any third party, (b) may adversely impact Lulu, (c) may subject us, our affiliates, or any third party to liability, or (d) may be fraudulent.
    
* You are in breach of the Terms.
    

### Termination

You may terminate the Global Distribution Agreement for any reason by (a) providing us 30 days advance notice and (b) closing your account. We may terminate the Global Distribution Agreement for any reason at any time without notice.
