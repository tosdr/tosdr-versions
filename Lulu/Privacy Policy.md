    * After you establish an account, our Site lets you store preferences like how your content is displayed, your location, and safe search settings.

    * We retain information on your behalf, such as content submitted via the Services in connection with an order, the creation of content, or the distribution of content. 
        
    * If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to reply. 
        
    * If we provide the ability to post messages to the Site (i.e., a forum), the information in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. 
        
    * We also collect other types of Personal Data that you may provide to us voluntarily in connection with support for the Services, such as your operating system and version and mobile device or computer type. 
        
    * If you participate in a survey, contest, or giveaway on our Site, we may ask for your e-mail address and/or phone number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity or to send prizes. Surveys and contests are voluntary, and you should read the rules for each contest that you enter. 
        
    * We may also collect Personal Data at other points during your use of our Site or Services that state that Personal Data is being collected.

        To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. 
        
    
    * **Log Files.**
        
        As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve information more appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.
