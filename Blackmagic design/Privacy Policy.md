        A fee will not apply to making a request for access or update to or deletion of your personal information. A fee may apply and be charged for providing the information to you.

        1. (a)

        2. (b)
            
            the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, and the information would not be discoverable in those proceedings;
            
        3. (c)
            
            giving access would be unlawful;
            
        4. (d)
            
            denying access is otherwise required or authorised by law; or
            
        5. (e)
            
            the request for access is frivolous or vexatious.
            
    5. 13.5
        
        If we refuse to provide you with access to or correct your personal information, we will provide you with an explanation in writing.

        Please note that if the GDPR applies to you then you will have additional rights (see section 9) and where your GDPR rights are different from what is stated here then we will respect your GDPR rights in preference to the rights in this Section 13.
