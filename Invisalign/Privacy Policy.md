We may also disclose personal information about you to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or legal counsel if required by law or necessary to protect Align property or other legal rights.
    
4. **How Long We Keep Information**
    
    Align will retain your personal information for only as long as it has an ongoing legitimate need to do so, for example, to provide you with goods and services, and to comply with regulatory obligations. The personal information will then be either deleted or anonymized. In some cases, this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), in which case your personal information will be securely stored as long as we have it.
    
5. **Your Rights and How to Exercise Them**  
      
    Certain states in the United States grant legal rights regarding personal information, like California, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, and Connecticut. These include the right to know, delete, correct, limit, and opt-out of certain processing of personal information, with some legal exceptions. Align, by law, will not discriminate in response to any privacy requests you make. We do our best to extend these rights to everybody, but some patient data we receive as part of services we provide to dental providers. In those cases, we are required by law to forward your request to the business, covered entity, or controller (i.e., the dental provider) for processing. 
    
    In order to ensure that a request is genuine, we may need to take steps to verify your identity, or the identity of an agent making a request on your behalf (such as logging into an Align account or responding to message from our team using an email on file). To learn more or to exercise any of your personal information privacy rights, please make a submission using our [Privacy Rights Web Form](https://submit-irm.trustarc.eu/services/validation/8838d55a-81a4-4d95-997b-8b13f4fc29a0)
    
6. **Other Disclosures**  
      
    **Children’s Privacy** At Align, we do not intend to collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13), unless the personal information is collected from a parent or guardian. While we cannot stop a child from accessing our Sites, we do not collect any personal information without making it clear that the person providing the information must be at least 13 years old. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us personal information which you would like to review or request be deleted, or you have questions about our Sites collecting personal information from children, please contact us at [privacy@aligntech.com.](mailto: privacy@aligntech.com)
    
    Please note that the age threshold mentioned above may vary depending on applicable legal requirements in your jurisdiction. If this is the case, we will indicate it accordingly at the time of collection. **Links to Other Sites** Our Sites may contain links to other websites merely as a convenience. Align is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites, and inclusion of links does not mean we endorse the information or company. This means that if you connect to another site through our Sites, we are not responsible for and we cannot control what they do with your personal information.
    
    Also, you may have the opportunity to share your personal information with other websites, such as social media sites. We may provide a convenient link to let you do this easily, but we are not responsible for, and we cannot control their websites or your posts/sharing. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies and personal information collection practices of these other websites and social media sites. **Marketing and Do Not Contact** We may send you information about us from time to time if you have given us your consent (where required). Align provides you the opportunity to request to stop receiving electronic communications from either Align or our partners by withdrawing your consent. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please tell us when we collect your personal information or write us at [remove@aligntech.com](mailto: remove@aligntech.com) at any time and make sure to include your location. You may also use the convenient unsubscribe feature included with emails. Please allow us enough time to process your request.
    
    Keep in mind, this withdrawal of consent does not apply to necessary communications, such as responding to an inquiry, and is revoked if you later request information from us, for example, if you sign up to receive news alerts from us. **Social Media** If you are a user of Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites with public account settings and you hashtag using one of our public campaigns, such as #14MillionSmiles, or one using our product names, such as #Invisalign, #InvisalignLive, or #InvisalignSmile─ we will be able to pull your reviews of our products from the social media sites and post them on our Sites. This is so that we can share your opinions about our products with the visitors of our Sites. Before being posted on our Sites, your comments will be reviewed by us. Please do not use these hashtags if you do not wish for your reviews to be made available on our Sites.
    
    By posting or otherwise making available any content about your Invisalign® experience on a public social media platform, and responding “yes” if we ask for your permission to re-post content on our owned channels, such as Facebook ([https://facebook.com/invisalign](https://facebook.com/invisalign)), Pinterest ([https://pinterest.com/Invisalign](https://pinterest.com/Invisalign)), YouTube ([https://youtube.com/invisalign](https://youtube.com/invisalign)), Twitter ([https://twitter.com/invisalign](https://twitter.com/invisalign)), Instagram ([https://instagram.com/invisalign](https://instagram.com/invisalign) & [https://instagram.com/invisalignlive](https://instagram.com/invisalignlive)), and others, you represent and warrant that you are thirteen (13) years of age or older and that you agree to the terms and conditions listed on our page on those websites.
    
    If a parent, guardian, or anyone else becomes aware of user-generated content shared from an individual under the age of thirteen (13) without adult consent, please email us at [InvisalignTakeDown@aligntech.com.](mailto: InvisalignTakeDown@aligntech.com)
