====================

§ 1

**Scope**

1.1

These Business Terms and Conditions apply to the conclusion of contracts made via the website of [www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/) and all subdomains (hereinafter referred to as “Website”) or through related e-mail communication, and to all related services provided by MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland (hereinafter referred to as “MDPI”).

Any business terms by the Customer which diverge from these Terms and Conditions shall not apply, unless expressly confirmed by MDPI in written form.

1.4

The Terms of Use of the Website ([**https://www.mdpi.com/about/termsofuse**](https://www.mdpi.com/about/termsofuse)) constitute an integral part of the present Terms and Conditions.

1.5

In the event of any conflict between these Terms and Conditions and any other terms or information provided by MDPI (e.g., the Terms of Use of the Website referenced herein or the Article Processing Charges Information "APC"), these Terms and Conditions shall prevail over all other terms and information.

§ 2

**Offering of MDPI**

2.1

MDPI only offers scientific publication via its Journals on the Website and editorial services, which are described in § 3.

2.2

MDPI will use reasonable efforts to expand post-publication coverage of all MDPI's journals within the main academic databases, scope-specific databases and country-specific journal ranking lists. But apart from this § 2.1, MDPI shall not owe any further services or results to the Customer under these Terms and Conditions. In particular, but not limited to, MDPI will not provide or warrant any indexation or abstracting of publications of Customers, repository delivery services, digital preservation of publications or similar services. The Customer acknowledges that MDPI has no influence or control on journal rankings, indexation or de-indexation of publications or the number of publications citations.

§ 3

**Ordering and Purchasing of Services from MDPI**

3.1

3.2

The requirements for registering with the Website are that the Customer is of full age and has full legal capacity.

The Customer asks for contracting publication and editorial services with MDPI the moment she/he/they submit(s) an original scientific article (“Article”) for evaluation through peer-review and possible publication by MDPI.

3.4

The Customer agrees to support open access publishing, which allows unlimited access to his/her published paper. In addition, the Customer agrees to the [**article processing charge**](https://www.mdpi.com/about/apc) (“APC”) and is bound to pay the APC after acceptance of the paper for publication.

3.5

The Customer agrees that all withholding tax (WHT) obligations and any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature (collectively, “Taxes”), if applicable, shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer. All payments to MDPI shall be made in full, without any deduction for Taxes. If any payments to be made by the Customer to MDPI under these Terms and Conditions are subject to any Taxes, the Customer shall pay to MDPI such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by MDPI after the deduction of such Taxes is equal to the amount MDPI would have received if no such Taxes had been deducted.

3.6

When purchasing services from MDPI, the Customer has the following cancellation right: The Customer can withdraw her/his Article and cancel the declared intention to conclude the contract any time during the evaluation (peer-review) of the Article. Once the Article is accepted for publication, it may no longer be withdrawn by the Customer. Any benefits or interests received by the Customer up to the cancellation must be restituted to MDPI.

3.7

MDPI has the following cancellation rights: MDPI reserves the right to turn down or reject an Article without specifying any reasons. This applies until the conclusion of the contract.  
  
After the contract has been concluded, MDPI has a right of termination for convenience during 30 days after the conclusion of the contract.  
  
MDPI can terminate the contract at any time without notice for good cause. Such good cause can be in particular:  
  
\- if there is suspicion of plagiarism, according to which the Article has been plagiarized in whole or in part;  
  
\- if there is a suspicion that the Customer has misrepresented, falsified or manipulated data or research results;  
  
\- if MDPI expects reputational risks as a result of the collaboration/contractual relationship;  
  
\- if the Article raises or could raise legal problems, e.g. through defamation;  
  
\- if MDPI is of the opinion that the Article contains scientific or technical errors or no longer corresponds to the scientific state of the art (i.e. is out of date);  
  
\- if there is a suspicion that the stated authors have not contributed or if essential authors have not been named.

In the event of termination for convenience, MDPI shall reimburse the Customer for all service fees that the Customer may have already paid to MDPI in connection with the conclusion of the contract. This does not apply to services already rendered for English editing.

3.8

In case a Customer pays more than invoiced by MDPI, any bank or transaction charges will be deduced from a partial refund of the overpaid amount.

3.9

Once an article is published, MDPI will refund authors in exceptional circumstances only and a decision will be made on a case-by-case basis.

3.10

Once an Article is published, it is likely to be archived and referenced in a number of archives and repositories. The Article will in principle remain published permanently and cannot be removed from a Journal and/or the Website, subject to the following provision: MDPI reserves the right to remove at any time and in MDPI's sole discretion any Article(s) or any other content from a Journal and/or the Website, in particular, but not limited to, if in MDPI's sole perspective, an Article or any other content violates (i) applicable law, (ii) these Terms and Conditions or (iii) would give MDPI a right for termination for good cause as described under Clause 3.7.

Such removal does not entitle the Customer to reimbursement of any APCs.
