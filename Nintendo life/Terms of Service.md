Competitions / Giveaways / Promotions
-------------------------------------

The operators of this website will occasionally run competitions, give-aways or promotions where users of the website can enter and win prizes. Prizes are often supplied by games publishers, advertising agencies, retailers or other 3rd party companies that are not affiliated with Hookshot Media Ltd.

These terms and conditions together with any specific rules set out in Competition Notices (as defined below) are the Competition Rules ("Rules") and apply to competitions taking place across this website, our social media accounts (eg, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and partner websites, unless otherwise expressly stated.

By entering a Competition, entrants agree to be bound by the Rules. Rules specific to each Competition are displayed in a notice on the page for such Competition ("Competition Notice") and are incorporated into the Rules. In the event of differences between these terms and conditions and the Competition Notice, the Competition Notice shall prevail.

We reserve the right to cancel or amend Competitions or the Rules at its sole discretion and without notice in the event of any event outside our reasonable control.

In the event of any dispute regarding the Rules, conduct, results and all other matters relating to a Competition, the decision of Hookshot Media Ltd shall be final.

### Qualifying Entrants

Employees (or members of the families or households of employees) of Hookshot Media Ltd or any company involved in a Competition including, if relevant, the company which has made the product to which a Competition relates, are not eligible to enter the Competition. We reserve the right not to award a prize (and to select an alternative winner) if we are aware or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a winner is not eligible for these reasons.

Additional eligibility requirements may apply to a specific Competition, e.g. a attending a particular event (proof of attending may be requested).

By entering a Competition, you hereby warrant that all information submitted by you is true, current and complete. We reserve the right to verify the eligibility of all entrants and disqualify an entrant for submitting false information.

The address you provide with your Competition entry (at time of entry, or upon winning a prize) will be used to send any prizes so please make sure this is correct.

Where a Competition is open to all age groups, you must still obtain appropriate parental/guardian permission if you are under 18. Where a Competition is only open to a certain age group (e.g. 18 and over), this will be made clear in the Competition Notice.

We reserve the right to disqualify any entrant if it has reasonable grounds to believe the entrant is not eligible or has otherwise breached any of the Rules.

### Competition Entries

Unless stated otherwise in the Competition Notice, and subject to the remainder of this clause, you may only enter a Competition once. Where we discover or has reasonable grounds to suspect that any entrant has used any software or automated process either to answer questions, enter the Competition or to make bulk entries, we may exclude such entries and disqualify the entrant from the Competition.

Competition entries must be made in the manner and by the closing date and time specified on the Competition Notice. Failure to do so will disqualify the entry.

There is no charge to enter a Competition. However, standard mobile data and internet connection charges may apply.

### Prizes

Where the winner is to be selected at random, he or she will be selected either by a computer process that produces verifiable random results. If the selection of a winning entry is open to subjective interpretation, an independent judge, third party, or a panel that includes Hookshot Media Ltd staff may be appointed. Those appointed to act as judges will be competent to judge the competition and their full names will be made available on request. In all matters, the decision of the judge(s) or panel shall be final and no correspondence or discussion shall be entered into.

Prizes will be provided either directly by Hookshot Media Ltd or a third party such as the product supplier, advertising agency or PR company who sponsor that competition. In this case your contact details and if applicable mailing address will be passed to the third party for the sole reason of delivering the prize. If a third party is delivering the prize Hookshot Media Ltd takes no responsibility over the time taken to receive the prize, or any other matter related to the prize giving. Please review our [privacy policy](https://www.nintendolife.com/privacy) for more information on how we handle your data.

If more than one prize is awarded only one prize per entrant will be awarded. Prize winners' names may be published on this website.

Where we require a winner to claim a prize claims must be made in the manner and within the time specified on the Competition Notice. Failure to claim a prize within this time or in the manner specified may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner.

Prizes are non-transferable and there is no cash alternative. We reserve the right to substitute prizes of equal or greater value at any time in its sole discretion.

Where there is a minimum age requirement for entry, this will be stated in the Competition Notice and must be observed. We reserve the right to request written proof of age and/or identity of any entrant including the winner. Where no such written proof is supplied, or the entrant is not the requisite age, we may disqualify the entrant.

### Liability

Hookshot Media Ltd cannot accept any responsibility for any damage, loss, injury or disappointment suffered by any entrant entering a Competition or as a result of accepting any prize. Hookshot Media Ltd is not responsible for any technical issues in relation to any telecommunications or internet network (including in relation to speed or bandwidth), including any injury or damage to entrants or any other persons device related to or resulting from participation or downloading any materials in a Competition.
