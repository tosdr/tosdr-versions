Terms of Use
============

**Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)** 
------------------------------------------------------

Online Services Terms and Conditions
------------------------------------

Effective Date: August 1, 2024

These Terms & Conditions (these **"Terms & Conditions"** or **"Terms"**) apply to the website located at mbta.com, other websites (each a **“Website”**) and mobile applications (each a **“Mobile App”**) operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, the **"MBTA", "we", "our", or "us"**), and the services and information (collectively, the **"Services"**) that we provide on such Websites and Mobile Apps (the Services, Websites, and Mobile Apps are collectively referred to as the **"Platform"**).

To assist you in using the Platform and to ensure a clear understanding of the relationship arising from your use of the Platform, we have created these Terms & Conditions and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.mbta.com/policies/privacy-policy). Our Terms govern your use of our Platform, and our Privacy Policy explains how we treat information that we have about you. Our Terms apply to anyone that uses or visits our Platform (collectively, **"you"** and **"your"**).

**1\. Your Agreement**

If you do not agree with these Terms, then please do not use our Platform. PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS INCLUDE A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND A WAIVER TO BRING CLAIMS AS CLASS ACTIONS.

By accessing or otherwise using our Platform, you acknowledge that you have read these Terms and agree to be legally bound by them. We may also confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms by asking you to click an "I accept" button, checkbox, or similar mechanism when you access certain portions of our Platform, such as during the registration process when creating an online account with us.

Moreover, if you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a company, an organization, or other legal entity (**"Your Organization"**), then: (i) you represent and warrant that you have authority to act on behalf of, and to bind, Your Organization; and (ii) for all purposes in these Terms and the Privacy Policy, the term "you" means Your Organization on whose behalf you are acting.

YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OLD TO USE THE PLATFORM OR TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN THE SERVICES. DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM OR CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN THE SERVICES IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OLD. PLEASE REFER TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING AGE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR PLATFORM.

**2\. Scope; Relationship to Privacy Policy and Other Contracts.** 

Our Privacy Policy explains, among other topics, how we treat information that you provide to us through the Platform. By accessing our Platform, you consent to our privacy practices as set out in our Privacy Policy (available here: [https://www.mbta.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://www.mbta.com/policies/privacy-policy)). Our Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by reference.

Moreover, certain portions of the Platform may be subject to additional or different terms and conditions (the **"Separate Terms"**). For example, the services and information available on the subdomain at [charlie.mbta.com](https://charlie.mbta.com/) and your use of the Charlie System are governed under the Charlie System Terms of Service (available here: [https://www.mbta.com/policies/terms-use-charlie](https://www.mbta.com/policies/terms-use-charlie)), as further set out in Section 5 (Payments; Purchases). These Terms must be read in conjunction with: (i) Separate Terms; (ii) any other agreements into which you and the MBTA may enter; and (iii) our Privacy Policy. To the extent that these Terms conflict with the terms of our Privacy Policy, the terms of our Privacy Policy shall control. Similarly, to the extent these Terms conflict with the terms and conditions of any Separate Terms or other specific agreements you enter with us, the terms and conditions of such Separate Terms or other specific agreement shall control.

**3\. Registered Users.** 

To access and participate in certain Services, you must create certain accounts with us and become a registered user (**"Registered User"**). By creating an online, single sign-on (SSO) account, you may be able to access and participate across a variety of Services. Certain Service(s), however, may require that you create an account that specifically governs your access to and participation in such Service(s). For example, you will need to create a Charlie account to utilize certain features of our fare payment system, as further set out in Section 5 (Payments; Purchases). To become a Registered User, and to participate in certain Services, you may also be required to agree to other terms and conditions with us and/or our service providers. As set forth in Section 2 (Relationship to Privacy Policy and Other Contracts), your use of our Platform as a Registered User is further subject to and governed by the terms of other agreements into which you may enter in addition to these Terms.

During the registration process, you must provide certain information. You agree that the information you provide to us in this process is complete and accurate. If you become a registered user and obtain a password, we will treat anyone who uses your username and password as "you", and you agree to be responsible for all uses by anyone using your password. Please notify us immediately if you suspect that someone is using your username and/or password in an unauthorized or inappropriate manner.

**4\. T-Alert; SMS Terms and Conditions.**

You may subscribe to receive T-Alerts, which are notifications about delays and planned disruptions for the routes and services you select. T-Alerts are delivered via email or text messages. You may edit your alerts subscriptions and otherwise manage your account and settings by signing into your MBTA Account.

If you wish to receive T-Alerts via text messages to your cellular phone and you provide us with your cellular phone number, then the following terms shall apply (as further set out in our T-Alerts SMS Terms and Conditions available at [https://www.mbta.com/policies/t-alerts-sms-terms-and-conditions](https://www.mbta.com/policies/t-alerts-sms-terms-and-conditions)).

When you opt in to receive T-Alerts via text messages, we will send you an SMS message to confirm your signup. You can cancel the T-Alerts service at any time. Just text "STOP" to 58541 or visit [https://alerts.mbta.com](https://alerts.mbta.com/). After you send the SMS message "STOP" to us, we will send you an SMS message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. If you want to join again, just sign up as you did the first time, and we will start sending SMS messages to you again.

If at any time you forget what keywords are supported, just text "HELP" to [58541](tel: 58541). After you send the SMS message "HELP" to us, we will respond with instructions on how to use our service as well as how to unsubscribe. We are able to deliver messages to the following major mobile phone carriers: AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, MetroPCS, U.S. Cellular, Alltel, Boost Mobile, Nextel, and Virgin Mobile. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

As always, message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to you from us and to us from you. You will receive messages regarding alerts that are active on the routes and lines you subscribe to during the windows of time you choose when you subscribe. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your wireless provider. For all questions about the service provided by this short code, you can call [617-222-3200](tel: 617-222-3200). If you have any questions regarding privacy matters, please refer to our Privacy Policy as further set forth in Section 2 (Scope; Relationship to Privacy Policy and Other Contracts).

If you have any questions regarding privacy matters, please refer to our Privacy Policy as further set forth in Section 2 (Scope; Relationship to Privacy Policy and Other Contracts).

**5\. Payments; Purchases.**

Our Platform may include services made available by one or more third-party payment services providers (each, a **"Payment Processor"**) that you must use to set up and manage recurring payments, or to make one-time payments. We do not process payments ourselves. When you make payments or subscribe to recurring payments on our Platform, you authorize our Payment Processor(s) to charge you using your selected payment method. Please note that your use of the Payment Processor's services may be subject to your acceptance of such Payment Processor's own terms and conditions, in addition to or in lieu of these Terms. We reserve the right at any time to reject any order or purchase, and to change prices and fees in accordance with applicable law. If your initial payment authorization is later revoked, your subscription, product, or access will be terminated. You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the products made available through the Sites for commercial purposes without our advance written permission.

We are currently implementing a new fare payment system as part of our Fare Transformation project (the **“Charlie System”**). The Charlie System will enable several new features over time, including allowing riders to pay their fare using contactless payment methods (such as with contactless credit cards, or Apply Pay or Google Pay on mobile devices) and the ability to manage accounts online. Your use of the Charlie Services is governed by the separate Charlie Services Terms & Conditions available at [https://www.mbta.com/policies/terms-use-charlie](https://www.mbta.com/policies/terms-use-charlie). Learn more about the Charlie Services at [charlie.mbta.com](https://charlie.mbta.com/).

Right to Decline Submitted Content.** We reserve the right to refuse to use, disable, or remove Submitted Content that we conclude, in our sole discretion, violates any applicable law, these Terms, or our Privacy Policy, or is incompatible with the purposes of our Platform or business operations.

**15\. Modifications to these Terms.** 

From time to time, we may change these Terms for our business purposes and to comply with changes in law. In the event of substantive or material changes, we may communicate these changes to you by posting the updated Terms on the Platform and/or notifying you of the change via the Platform, email, or other methods. Any changes to these Terms shall take effect proactively. Regardless of whether we have provided you with notice other than by posting updated Terms on the Platform, your subsequent acceptance of these Terms pursuant to Section 1 (Your Agreement) constitutes your agreement to be bound by the Terms, as updated.

**16\. Assignment.** 

These Terms shall not be assignable by you, either in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. The MBTA reserves the right to assign its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent.

**17\. Jury Trial; Class Action Waiver.**

YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. IN ADDITION, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT EACH PARTY TO A DISPUTE HEREUNDER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**18\. General.** 

These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions. Both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts. The parties further agree that any cause of action arising under these Terms or our Privacy Policy shall exclusively be brought in such courts. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. The MBTA's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not constitute a waiver of its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Subject to Section 2 (Relationship to Privacy Policy and Other Contracts), this agreement and the terms and conditions contained herein set forth the entire understanding and agreement between the MBTA and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior or contemporaneous understanding, whether written or oral.
