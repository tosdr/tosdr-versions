### openSUSE - Your Right to be Forgotten

The openSUSE Project provides a straightforward mechanism for users to request the erasure of their personal data based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This commitment ensures the protection and privacy of user information engaged with the openSUSE Project. This page assists with knowledge sharing for our openSUSE community and contributors.

### Requesting Data Deletion

Users wishing to exercise their right to data deletion under GDPR can do so through the [GDPR Web Form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8dbe264e-9e4e-4ec2-9cea-d3392eb265ee/e9f1f6d6-d5e0-42d5-921a-1703d1794176). This form is hosted on a third-party platform with expertise in privacy, security and compliance management, which is also found on SUSE's Privacy Policy. This form facilitates openSUSE users in submitting deletion requests securely and efficiently. Upon requesting your right to be forgotten, you should be directed to the GDPR form or directed to the Data Protection Officer at email privacy@suse.com. Requests are centralized through the third-party platform to ensure consistent handling and compliance with legal obligations.

The use of third-party tools allows for workflow management to ensure adherence to GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act and global privacy regulations. Continuous engagement with legal advisors ensures that data deletion practices remain aligned with current legislation and regulatory requirements.

Administrators identify services logging or storing user data. Each service undergoes a review to determine the feasibility of data deletion, in consultation with legal advisors, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations.

Administrators follow specific guidelines for processing requests and deletions across various services. Some services may require a Data Protection Impact Assessment for a more thorough examination.

For information regarding our privacy practices, refer to the [openSUSE Privacy Policy](https://en.opensuse.org/Terms_of_site), which inherits relevant aspects from SUSE but is specifically tailored to the openSUSE Project and its community.
