    3. **Use of Application and Services**
        1. The access and use of Application are subject to this Terms of Use.  
              
            You have full discretion either to use the Application or other apps, whether to use Services available on Application, or to stop using the Application.  
              
            We only facilitate You finding various Services You need by providing Application. All Services are provided directly by independent third parties who agreed to become Our partners (“**Service Provider**”).  
              
            When ordering a Service, the Application will connect You with the available Service Provider around Your location. Thus, some Services cannot be used if You do not activate the location feature.  
              
            Furthermore, if the Service Provider accepts Your order, We will inform Your order status through Application.
