Where applicable, you also have the right to have the personal data concerning you transferred to you or to another controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, provided that the processing is based on consent or a contract and is carried out by automated means. However, this does not apply if the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. You also have the right to obtain the direct transfer of personal data from one controller to another controller where technically feasible and where this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

**III. Use of upday news services with tracking and cookies**

**1\. General**

If you consent to the use of upday with tracking and cookies, not only our own content or content that is played out on our behalf (Art. 28 GDPR) will be displayed, but also content from third parties. This can be editorial content, recommendations for external content, games and surveys, but also product advertising, e.g. in the form of personalized, i.e. on your presumed interests based on your usage behavior selected advertising banners on the side of the page or ads under articles. The legal basis for the processing of personal data is in each case Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

If such content is loaded, this is done from servers of the respective third-party providers. This always involves the transmission of certain data to the third-party providers, in many cases also personal data. In addition, cookies or similar technologies are used for most of the services of the third-party providers by means of which the content is loaded. The purposes for which this data is processed by the third-party providers on their own responsibility, but also partly on our responsibility, are manifold.

Here we inform you about the use of cookies or comparable technologies and the processing of personal data by the third-party providers.

**2\. Cookies and Similar Technologies**

In order to provide our service, ensure security, prevent fraud, eliminate errors and provide content, the use of cookies and similar technologies is necessary (essential). Your [Privacy Settings](#) and your cookie settings (regarding permitted/blocked cookies) are also stored on your end device. The use of cookies is required for us to provide you with the service requested by you. Please refer to the [Privacy Setting](#) for further information on these special categories of cookies.

Cookies are small files that your browser places in a folder designated for this purpose on your device. This makes it possible, for instance, to determine whether you have visited a website before. Many cookies contain what is known as a “cookie ID”. A cookie ID is a unique cookie identifier. It consists of a string of characters which websites and servers can associate with the specific web browser where the cookie has been stored. This enables visited websites and servers to differentiate between the specific browser of the Data Subject and other web browsers containing different cookies. A specific web browser can be recognised and identified using the unique cookie ID. Without additional information, cookies cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies and similar technologies are needed to (partly) collect personal data or to store it on your terminal device and to subsequently process personal data, among other purposes:

\- to select simple displays,

\- Create a personalized ad profile,

\- select personalized ads,

\- Create a personalized content profile

\- select personalized content,

\- Measure ad performance,

\- Measure content performance,

\- use market research to gain insights into target groups, and

\- to develop and improve products,

(so-called "IAB processing purposes").

For more information on IAB processing purposes and individual third party providers, please read further in the [Privacy Settings](#).

When using apps, technology that is functionally equivalent to cookies is used instead of cookies; this may be for example the operating system-specific advertising ID, vendor ID or a randomly generated user ID.

Unless otherwise agreed, we and our partners will only employ other cookies and similar technologies with your consent expressed through the [Privacy Setting](#). These cookies are used by us and our partners to store and process data on your end device for the purposes listed below in this Privacy Policy. If consent is not granted for the setting of cookies, it may not be possible to fully use all functions of our website.

More information on the cookies used and equivalent technologies and our partners is provided in the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy and your [Privacy Setting](#), where you can withdrawal your consent with future effect at any time. Previously created cookies can also be deleted by you at any time using your web browser or another software solution. This is possible in all standard web browsers. Please note that this will also delete any settings you have made in your [Privacy Setting](#), such that these will need to be reconfigured when you visit our website again. The duration of the cookies is limited to a maximum of one year unless otherwise stated.

**3\. Geo Location**

For the purpose and in the interest of displaying content with a regional reference to your location, we process your IP address. The geographical information obtained in this way can in no way be used to draw conclusions about the specific location of a user. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

**4\. Affiliate Marketing**

If you access our website from an external website via an advertising banner, we will receive information from the operator of the external website (“Affiliate”) that a user has accessed our service via that external website. This information is stored by us in a cookie on your end device.

Clicking on an advertising banner of an external service provider on our website (“Advertiser”) will forward you to the relevant site of the Advertiser. In this case, we as the Affiliate will transmit the information to the Advertiser that a user has accessed their website from our website. This information is the product ID associated with the marketed service and the identification number assigned to us (Affiliate ID) as well as a user ID comprising a series of arbitrary numbers. This information is usually stored by the Advertiser in a cookie on your end device and is automatically deleted after no later than 30 days. If you submit an order on the Advertiser’s website within 30 days, this information will automatically be transmitted in encrypted form to us upon conclusion of the order process. We can only learn from the information that a user has accessed the Advertiser’s external website from our website via the advertising banner and that they have purchased the marketed product there. No personal data is processed in this connection. Please refer to the Privacy Policy of the Advertiser on their website for information about how the Advertiser processes personal data.

In service of our interest in and for the purpose of optimising the advertising of third parties (“Advertisers”) on our website and the advertising that we place on third-party websites (“Affiliates”), we make use of the services of “Affiliate Networks”, for which a cookie will be stored on your system. This cookie stores the Affiliate ID, the User ID and the Product ID. The purpose of storing this data is to process commission payments between the Advertiser and Affiliate via the Affiliate Network. You can prevent cookies from being set by our website at any time, as explained above, by configuring the web browser in use to block cookies; this represents your permanent objection to the setting of cookies. Further information on the individual affiliate networks and your rights as a data subject can be found in their respective privacy policies.

**5\. Partner Offers and Services**

If you have given your consent to upday with tracking and cookies, we also integrate interesting offers and services from selected partners ("partner offers") into our website. The partner service page is provided by the partner indicated there. The partner is responsible for the content of the partner service page and the data processing operations taking place there in accordance with Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR. Information about the Partner can be found in the Partner's imprint. For information on the data processing operations that take place via the partner service page and your rights as a data subject, please refer to the partner's privacy policy, which is also linked there.

**IV. Social media and partner offers**

**1\. Facebook Fanpages**

We use Facebook Fanpages under the following links, for which we are jointly responsible with Meta Platforms Ireland Limited:

[https://www.facebook.com/updayNL](https://www.facebook.com/updayNL)

[https://www.facebook.com/updayESP](https://www.facebook.com/updayESP)

[https://www.facebook.com/upday](https://www.facebook.com/upday)

In joint responsibility with Facebook, we analyse how you use our Fanpage (Page Insights). You can obtain the information required by the GDPR on data processing within the scope of Page Insights from Facebook; currently by name in Facebook's privacy policy at [https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information\_about\_page\_insights\_data.](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data)

Facebook also provides you with the relevant contents of the joint responsibility processing agreement concluded between Facebook and us in accordance with Art. 26 GDPR; currently at the following link: [https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page\_controller\_addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum).

As part of the Page Insights, we ourselves only receive anonymised statistics - we do not have access to personal data processed by Facebook. The processing of anonymised data by us is based on legal regulations that allow us to process personal data because we have an overriding legitimate interest in gaining a better understanding of the interests of visitors to our Fanpage (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). Facebook offers various community functions on the fan pages with which you can interact with other users, for example by posting articles there, leaving comments or liking or sharing articles. Please note that these areas are publicly accessible and that any personal information you post or provide when registering may be viewed by others. We cannot control how other users of the Fanpages use this information. In particular, we cannot prevent unsolicited messages from being sent to you.

**2\. Social Plugins**

There are no social media plugins integrated on this website that directly load data from the servers of the relevant social media providers. The integrated "plugins" are rather simple links to the relevant third-party sites, which we illustrate with corresponding graphics. A transmission of personal data to the operator of the social media service through the known plugins therefore does not take place.

**3\. Contextual contents**

In certain areas of our website you will find content and advertising selected and displayed by Outbrain UK Limited, 100 New Bridge Street, London, EC4V 6JA, United Kingdom ("Outbrain"). This selection of content and advertising is based exclusively on non-personal elements such as the content of the relevant page of our site (contextual) or on which topics or pages in our site are currently in particularly high demand. However, to establish the connection of your terminal device to the Outbrain server for the delivery of the relevant content and advertising, the processing of the IP address assigned to your terminal device at the relevant time by Outbrain is necessary. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

We have entered into an agreement with Outbrain in accordance with Article 26 of the GDPR to ensure that your rights in relation to your personal data are protected. This agreement essentially stipulates that

* Outbrain will only process the IP address to establish the connection for serving content and advertising without your consent;
* the setting of cookies and other data processing will only take place if you have consented to the use of the upday news service with tracking and cookies;
* a data transfer to the USA may only take place subject to the relevant EU standard contractual clauses;
* we provide you with the information listed above;
* You can exercise requests in accordance with Art. 12 and 15-22 of the GDPR directly with Outbrain ([here](https://my.outbrain.com/recommendations-settings/home), see also Outbrain's [Privacy Policy](https://www.outbrain.com/privacy/)), but that if you wish to exercise your rights directly with us, Outbrain will assist us with the relevant information, etc.

For more information about Outbrain and your rights as a data subject against Outbrain, please refer to Outbrain's [privacy policy](https://www.outbrain.com/privacy/). Information on the data processing carried out by Outbrain and its purposes, if you have consented to the use of upday with tracking and cookies, can be found in the privacy policy.

Your browser establishes a direct connection to the server of the respective provider.

In this context, usage profiles (based on cookie IDs, among other things) may also be formed and enriched, including outside the European Economic Area.
