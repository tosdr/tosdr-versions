This Section 16 only applies to you if you are a resident of the United States or if you commence any action against DoubleTap in the United States.
    
    Except for small claims disputes in which you or DoubleTap seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or DoubleTap seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and DoubleTap waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Baltimore, Maryland in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference.

Â§ 1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individuals claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and DoubleTap agree that for any arbitration you initiate, the party filing the claim will pay the filing fee and the parties will split the remaining JAMS fees and costs. You and DoubleTap agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Maryland and the United States sitting in Baltimore, Maryland have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
