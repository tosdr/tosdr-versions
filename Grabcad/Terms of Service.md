    2. 4.2. For the avoidance of doubt, the Software and any copies of the Software are only licensed, and no title in or to the Software or such copies passes to Customer. Except for the License, Customer is granted no other right in or to the Software under this Agreement, whether by implied license, estoppel, patent exhaustion, operation of law, or otherwise. Customer shall be primarily responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users. Stratasys grants the license in this Section 4 (License) under copyright and also, solely to the extent necessary to exercise such rights, under patent and any other applicable intellectual property rights.
5. **5.LICENSE RESTRICTIONS**
    1. 5.1. Customer shall not (and shall procure that each Authorized User does not) do any of the following: (a) copy or reproduce the Software; (b) sell, assign, lease, lend, rent, issue, sublicense, make available, or otherwise distribute to any third party, or publicly perform, display or communicate, the Software, or otherwise use the Software in a time-sharing, outsourcing, or service bureau environment, including without limitation as software-as-a-service; (c) modify, alter, adapt, arrange, translate, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, decrypt, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or non-literal aspects of, the Software; (d) remove, alter, or conceal, in whole or in part, any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notice or legend displayed or contained on or in the Software; (e) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related or technical features or protocols of the Software, such as features that restrict or monitor use of the Software; (f) make a derivative work of the Software, or use the Software to develop any service or product that is the same as (or substantially similar to) the Software; (g) disclose to the public the results of any internal performance testing or benchmarking studies of or about the Software, without first sending the results and related study(-ies) to Stratasys, and obtaining Stratasys’ written approval of the assumptions, methodologies and other parameters of the testing or study; (h) publish or transmit any robot, malware, Trojan horse, spyware, or similar malicious item intended (or that has the potential) to damage or disrupt the Software; and/or (i) use the Software to infringe, misappropriate or violate any third party's Intellectual Property Rights, moral rights, privacy or other personal right, or any Law.
    2. 5.2. The above restrictions are limitations on the License, and Customer's full compliance with the above is a condition to the License.
