Stratasys acts as sub-licensor of the Stratasys Affiliates, Stratasys, Inc. for the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa region only). Any license for a customer not located in such region must not be subject to this Agreement.

By clicking the "I Accept" button below, by creating an Admin Account (as defined below), or by otherwise accessing or using any part of the Software (as defined below), you on behalf of the Customer acknowledge these terms and conditions and represents that it has fully read and understood, and agrees to be bound by, the following (the date of such occurrence being the "**Effective Date**"):

Customer represents and warrants, on behalf of itself and its Authorized Users, that all information submitted during the registration process is, and will thereafter remain, complete and accurate. As between Stratasys and Customer, Customer alone shall be responsible and liable for maintaining the confidentiality and security of its all Admin Account and User Account credentials, as well as for all activities that occur under or in the Admin Account and any User Accounts. Customer shall immediately notify Stratasys in writing of any unauthorized access to, or use of, the Admin Account or any User Account, or any other breach of security.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any additional lawful agreement(s) entered by Customer for use of the Software, Stratasys grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license, during the Term (defined below), to permit its Authorized Users to access (and for distributed components of the Software, download and install) and use the Software in object code form only, and solely for Customer's own benefit and its business use (the "**License**").
    2. 4.2. For the avoidance of doubt, the Software and any copies of the Software are only licensed, and no title in or to the Software or such copies passes to Customer. Except for the License, Customer is granted no other right in or to the Software under this Agreement, whether by implied license, estoppel, patent exhaustion, operation of law, or otherwise. Customer shall be primarily responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users. Stratasys grants the license in this Section 4 (License) under copyright and also, solely to the extent necessary to exercise such rights, under patent and any other applicable intellectual property rights.
5. **5.LICENSE RESTRICTIONS**
    1. 5.1. Customer shall not (and shall procure that each Authorized User does not) do any of the following: (a) copy or reproduce the Software; (b) sell, assign, lease, lend, rent, issue, sublicense, make available, or otherwise distribute to any third party, or publicly perform, display or communicate, the Software, or otherwise use the Software in a time-sharing, outsourcing, or service bureau environment, including without limitation as software-as-a-service; (c) modify, alter, adapt, arrange, translate, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, decrypt, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or non-literal aspects of, the Software; (d) remove, alter, or conceal, in whole or in part, any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notice or legend displayed or contained on or in the Software; (e) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related or technical features or protocols of the Software, such as features that restrict or monitor use of the Software; (f) make a derivative work of the Software, or use the Software to develop any service or product that is the same as (or substantially similar to) the Software; (g) disclose to the public the results of any internal performance testing or benchmarking studies of or about the Software, without first sending the results and related study(-ies) to Stratasys, and obtaining Stratasys’ written approval of the assumptions, methodologies and other parameters of the testing or study; (h) publish or transmit any robot, malware, Trojan horse, spyware, or similar malicious item intended (or that has the potential) to damage or disrupt the Software; and/or (i) use the Software to infringe, misappropriate or violate any third party's Intellectual Property Rights, moral rights, privacy or other personal right, or any Law.
    2. 5.2. The above restrictions are limitations on the License, and Customer's full compliance with the above is a condition to the License.

    3. 5.3. If the Software is accessed under a Demo License of a paid subscription Software product, commercial use for direct monetization is prohibited, including using the Software for printing paid-parts in a service bureau or similar basis.

User acknowledges that (a) the Software may contain license keys or other programming routines capable of and intended to restrict its use to a particular computer, User, and/or printable consumable materials; and/or prohibiting use of the Software after the date on which User is no longer authorized to use the Software; and (b) the Software may also contain certain embedded restricted-access programming routines or modules, which are expressly excluded from access and use rights granted in this License, and may only be acquired and activated by rights granted by Stratasys or its authorized resellers, typically by providing a license key or password upon such acquisition, and that (c) any unauthorized access or use of such routines or modules by User without consent and authorization of Stratasys is a material breach of this License.
    6. 5.6. Customer acknowledges that the Software contains information and materials that are confidential and proprietary to Stratasys (and may even constitute Stratasys' or a Stratasys Affiliate's trade secrets), and therefore Customer agrees that a breach or threatened breach of this Section (License Restrictions) may cause Stratasys to suffer irreparable harm or damage for which monetary damages will be inadequate, and accordingly, if Stratasys seeks an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief to enforce any provision under this Section, Stratasys shall not be required to post a bond or to prove the likelihood of irreparable harm.
    7. 5.7. To the extent Customer is given the right, under any Law applicable to Customer, to receive information and/or materials for purposes of making the Software interoperable with other software products, Customer shall request from Stratasys (in a detailed writing) access to such information and/or materials, and if Stratasys accepts such request, Stratasys may (in its sole discretion) impose additional conditions on such access and use.
6. **6.PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS**
    1. 6.1. For paid subscription **Software** products and applications, the Paid License granted herein is subject to the full payment of the applicable license fees. Any pricing changes or other changes to the subscription plan will be made in accordance with the terms herein and any additional applicable agreement(s) entered by Customer for use of the Software.
    2. 6.2. Customer acknowledges that Stratasys may, at any time and upon thirty (30) days' prior notice (which notice may be made by posting a message on the Site), begin charging for any Software that is now or once was offered as Non-Paid License, and require Customer to purchase a term-based subscription license under its Admin Account in order to continue accessing and using the Software or certain modules or features of the Software. Such payment terms do not apply in case of any prevailing agreement between the Parties, such as without limitation, any purchase order and purchase confirmation for the Software involved or any framework agreement applying for software licensing by Stratasys to Customer.
    3. 6.3. Stratasys, together with its distributors and agents, reserves the right to periodically change subscription prices. In case of a change of the subscription price for renewal of Paid License the Customer may terminate the subscription of the Paid License with a 30 days notice period commencing from the date of announcement of the price change.

    4. 7.4. The Customer Data License is non-perpetual and may be revoked at any time by opting-out for the Customer Data in the Admin Account or in any other way.
8. **8.FEEDBACK**
    1. 8.1. Customer has no obligation to provide Stratasys with any feedback, ideas or suggestions concerning the Software or Documentation (collectively, "**Feedback**").

9. **9.THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE & SITES**
    1. 9.1. The Software may include third party software components and authorized interfaces with third party software that are subject to open source and/or pass-through commercial licenses and/or notices (" **Third Party Software**" and "**Third Party Software Terms and Notices**", respectively). Stratasys may make available in the Documentation a list (or other index) of such Third Party Software and Third Party Software Terms and Notices, and will comply with any valid written request submitted by Customer to Stratasys for exercising Customer's rights under such Third Party Software Terms and Notices. Customer acknowledges that its use of the Software is also governed by such Third Party Software Terms and Notices, and that to the extent of any conflict between this Agreement and any Third Party Software Terms and Notices, the latter shall control. Any covenants, representations, warranties, guarantees, conditions, indemnities or other commitments made by Stratasys in this Agreement concerning the Software (if any), are made by Stratasys and not by any authors, licensors, or suppliers of, or contributors to, such Third Party Software.
