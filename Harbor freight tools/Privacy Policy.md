Information We Obtain
---------------------

We obtain personal information about you in various ways, such as when you visit our website or use our mobile app (collectively, the “Services”). We also may obtain personal information about you offline, such as when you call one of Harbor Freight’s Customer Call Centers, mail or fax us, or interact with us at one of our stores. The types of personal information we may obtain include:

* Other information you choose to provide, such as through emails or other communications, social media pages, surveys, registrations and sign-up forms.

When you use our Services or open our emails, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as cookies, pixel tags, server or device logs, session replay and screen capture technology, and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “pixel tag” (also known as a web beacon), which is a type of technology that is often used in combination with cookies, is placed on a website or within an email to track certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. These technologies help us (1) remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it; (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services; (3) tailor the Services around your preferences; (4) measure the usability of the Services and the effectiveness of our communications; (5) authenticate your identity, protect against fraud and provide our products and services; and (6) otherwise manage and enhance our products and services, and help ensure they are working properly.

We also may use session replay and screen capture technology to collect, on a real-time basis, information on how you use and navigate the Services. This may include mouse movements, how you scroll through the Services, and certain keystroke information.

We may use these automated technologies on the Services to collect information about your device, browsing actions, and usage patterns. We obtain information about your device and web browser in this manner such as your device IP address, general location information, unique device identifiers, device type and model, device characteristics and settings, browser settings and characteristics, operating system type and version, language and country preferences, battery and signal strength, usage statistics, referring emails and web addresses, and other application details. We also may obtain information about your interactions with our Services, such as pages visited, links clicked, features used, dates and times of usage, session information, and other information about your use of our Services.

Your browser may tell you how to be notified about certain types of automated collection technologies and how to restrict or disable them. Please note, however, that without these technologies, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.

How We Use the Information We Obtain
------------------------------------

We may use the personal information we obtain to:

* Provide our products and services, manage your accounts, process your orders, ensure proper delivery, process returns, better assist you when you visit or call us as well as to improve our product and service offerings;
* Communicate with you, respond to inquiries and offer customer support;
* Personalize your experience with our products and services;
* Advertise and market our products and services;
* Administer participation in surveys, sweepstakes, promotions or other programs;
* Perform analytics and market, trend or statistical research;
* Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; improving and analyzing our products and services; managing our communications; and performing accounting, auditing and other internal functions);
* Maintain and enhance the safety and security of our products and services, prevent misuse and troubleshoot technical issues;
* Verify your identity and protect against fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities;
* Exercise our rights and remedies and defend against legal claims; and

### _Third-Party Analytics Services_

We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics. We also may use third-party session replay and screen capture services that record users’ interactions with the Services. The providers of these analytics services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, session replay and screen capture technology, and similar automated technologies to help us analyze your use of the Services. The information collected through these means may be disclosed to or collected directly by these services. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)

### _Interest-Based Advertising_

You may see our ads on other websites because we use third-party ad services on our Services. Through these ad services, we can tailor our messaging to individuals considering demographic data, inferred interests and browsing context. These ad services track information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites and apps by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other similar technologies. These ad services may collect data about your visits to websites and apps that participate in these services, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad services. These ad services use this information to show you ads that may be tailored to your individual interests. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Our Services are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.

We also do not engage in profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning consumers, as defined in the CPA. To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.
