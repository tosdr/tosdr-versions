### CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION

These Terms and Conditions supersede any other agreement between you and Harbor Freight to the extent necessary to resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity between them. These Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts, tribunals, agencies and other dispute resolution organizations in Los Angeles, California, USA, in all disputes (a) arising out of, relating to, or concerning any of the Sites and/or these Terms and Conditions, (b) in which any of the Sites and/or these Terms and Conditions is an issue or a material fact, or (c) in which any of the Sites and/or these Terms and Conditions is referenced in a paper filed in a court, tribunal, agency or other dispute resolution organization. Use of any of the Sites is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give full effect to all provisions of these Terms and Conditions, including without limitation this paragraph and the warranty disclaimers and liability exclusions above. Harbor Freight has endeavored to comply with all legal requirements known to it in creating and maintaining each of the Sites, but makes no representation that materials on any of the Sites are appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Use of any of the Sites is unauthorized in any jurisdiction where all or any portion of such Site may violate any legal requirements and you agree not to access such Site in any such jurisdiction. You are responsible for compliance with applicable laws. Any use in contravention of this provision or any provision of these Terms and Conditions is at your own risk and, if any part of these Terms and Conditions are invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall govern such use. This provision is void, inapplicable, and unenforceable within the State of New Jersey.

By visiting the Site(s) and or conducting business with us, you agree that, except as otherwise specified herein, the laws of the United States, including the Federal Arbitration Act, will govern any dispute that arises between us or between you and any of our affiliates or service providers resulting from or relating to your visit and use of our services or the Site.

ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under these Terms, except for matters that may be taken to small claims courts. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, NOT a judge or jury. You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms, including with respect to the interpretation of any provision of these Terms or other agreements between you and us, or concerning the performance or obligations of you and us, shall be resolved by mandatory and binding arbitration submitted to JAMS, formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or its Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines. Either party may file an arbitration demand with the JAMS pursuant to the conditions stated herein, including but not limited to:

1. Any claim required to be submitted to arbitration shall be made by filing a demand for arbitration within one (1) year of the date of discovery of the facts first giving rise to the claim.
2. Place of Arbitration Hearings. Either party may elect to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submission, but such arbitration shall be based in Los Angeles, California. If an in-person arbitration hearing is necessary or mutually agreeable, such in-person shall be conducted at a JAMS facility in your area or at a JAMS facility in Los Angeles.
3. The selection of the Arbitrator shall be made pursuant to JAMS’ then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules.
4. Similar demands for arbitration by more than one claimant represented by either the same law firm or law firms acting in coordination shall be subject to the then-current Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines.
5. Conduct of Arbitration. Unless JAMS’s then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules or JAMS’s Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines, as applicable, require otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Subject to the applicable JAMS procedure, the arbitrator shall allow reasonable discovery in the forms permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent consistent with the purpose of the arbitration. The arbitrator(s) shall have no power or authority to amend or disregard any provision of this section or any other provision of these Terms, except as necessary to comply with JAMS rules.
6. Findings and Conclusions. The arbitrator(s) shall, after reaching judgment and award, prepare and distribute to the parties written findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to such judgment and award and containing an opinion setting forth the reasons for the giving or denial of any award. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction.
7. Costs and Fees. If you elect to commence an arbitration, you will be subject to a filing fee pursuant to JAMS’s then-current procedures. To the extent permitted by JAMS procedures, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators’ and administrative fees of arbitration. We will remain responsible for our share of costs, expenses and fees in addition to any costs, expenses and fees required of us under JAMS procedures, including under JAMS’s Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines.
8. Litigation. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall apply to these Terms. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under these Terms, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal’s determination of the merits of the controversy).
9. Notwithstanding the arbitration clause herein, the parties also agree that we may bring suit in a federal or state court located in Los Angeles, California in cases of alleged infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or if your acts or conduct have subjected us to the imminent or reasonable risk of litigation from a third party. This provision is void, inapplicable, and unenforceable within the State of New Jersey.

### Class-Action Waiver

Any arbitration, claim or other proceedings by or between you and us shall be conducted on an individual basis and not through any class action, mass action, or on a consolidated or representative basis. You further agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief or to combine or aggregate similar claims or unrelated transactions. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, each party waives any right to a jury trial. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. This provision is void, inapplicable, and unenforceable within the State of New Jersey.

### Termination

You or we may suspend or terminate your account or your use of any of the Sites at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are personally liable for any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any aspect of any of the Sites at any time without notice.

### Additional Assistance

If you do not understand any of the foregoing Terms and Conditions or if you have any questions or comments, we invite you to call our Customer Support Department at 1-800-444-3353 Monday thru Friday, 5:00am-5:00pm PT and Saturday & Sunday, 7:00am- 3:00pm PT.

### Entire Agreement

These Terms and Conditions, the Privacy and Security Policy, and terms of sale constitute the entire agreement between you and Harbor Freight with respect to the Sites. This agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Harbor Freight with respect to the Sites. No modification of this agreement shall be effective unless it is authored by Harbor Freight, or unless it is physically signed in blue ink by a Harbor Freight executive officer. Any alleged waiver of any breach of this agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any future breach. A printed version of this agreement and/or of any notice given by Harbor Freight in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement or your use of any of the Sites to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained by Harbor Freight in printed form. This provision is void, inapplicable, and unenforceable within the State of New Jersey.

All other trademarks not owned by Harbor Freight or its affiliates that appear on any of the Sites are the property of their respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by Harbor Freight or its affiliates or subsidiaries.
