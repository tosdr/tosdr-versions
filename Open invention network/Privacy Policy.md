Privacy Policy
==============

Privacy Policy[oin-admin](https://openinventionnetwork.com/author/oin-admin/ "Posts by oin-admin")2024-01-17T21:23:38-05:00

This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Open Invention Network LLC (“OIN”) and our website [openinventionnetwork.com](http://openinventionnetwork.com/). This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

* What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
* What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
* The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
* How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

### Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

We only collect information that you voluntarily give us via our website forms or via email or other direct contact from you.  
We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill our obligations to you under the OIN license agreement.

If you opt in to our mailing list, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about news, conferences, and other matters such as changes to this privacy policy.

### Your Access to and Control Over Information

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via email at [info@openinventionnetwork.com](mailto:info@openinventionnetwork.com):

* See what data we have about you, if any.
* Change/correct any data we have about you.
* Have us delete any data we have about you.
* Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

### Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit information via our electronic signature service, your information is protected both online and offline.

In our electronic signature service form, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only parties who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, licensing representatives and administrative officers for legal notices) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

### Electronic Signature and Related Forms

It is not required that organizations join the OIN community via our online electronic signature service, as organizations may mail in signed hardcopies of the OIN license agreement.  However, many organizations opt to do so for convenience.  To do so, a user at the organization must first complete online forms.  During the filling of these forms, a user is required to give certain information (such as name, email address, and title). Our electronic signature service also stamps your signed OIN license agreement with your IP address.  This information is used to verify the user’s identity and provide legal notices to your organization as required by the OIN license agreement.

### Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

**If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at [info@openinventionnetwork.com](mailto:info@openinventionnetwork.com).**
