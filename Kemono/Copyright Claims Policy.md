#### DMCA Notice

Please allow up to 3-5 working days for your request to be processed. You may not receive a response unless further information is needed from you.

This information is required by the DMCA process. If any required information is falsified or omitted, your request may be not be processed.

Notices may be shared to 3rd party's for due diligence and transparency purposes

Please be aware that information that is not protected by copyright may not be removed from the site. This includes AI generated content, creator tags, creator profiles, wiki pages, links to social media profiles or other websites, links to works on other websites, and other factual information not protected by copyright law.

Please note that we will only honor content removal requests from the following parties:

* Legal copyright holder of the content
* Legal copyright holder of the character(s)
* The commissioner(s) of the content

Please consult the guide below for further information regarding when it's acceptable to submit a takedown request and when it's not.

You **SHOULD** submit a takedown request if you are one of the following:

* Creator wanting their own content removed.
* Character owner wanting content featuring their character removed.
* A commissioner who has paid for the content in question.
* Publisher wanting a publication or excerpts of a publication removed.

You **SHOULD NOT** submit a takedown request if you are one of the following:

* User wanting content removed because they believe it breaks a site rule. You should instead use the site's Flag For Deletion tool (found on every post's page) for each post that you wish to dispute.
* Friend, relative, or fan of an creator, character owner, or commissioner who wishes to act as a middlemen for the creator, character owner, or commissioner.
* Commissioner or character owner wanting to remove art that the creator themselves has posted. In those cases please ask the creator to file a takedown request for you.

Your email must include the following:

* Your contact information, including your name, physical address, phone number, and email address.
* Identification of the material you wish to have removed, with enough information to locate the material. For example, a list of links to each post on Kemono you wish to have removed. Screenshots or simply listing your creator tag, creator name, or social media accounts are not sufficient to locate the exact material you wish to have removed.
* Identification of the copyrighted work you claim is being infringed. For example, for each Kemono post you claim infringes on your copyright, a link to where the original work was posted on your Pixiv, Twitter, or other social media accounts or personal websites.
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the work you believe is being infringed was not authorized by the copyright owner, an agent of the owner, or the law.
* A statement that everything contained in the takedown notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright owner or have permission to act on the copyright ownerâ€™s behalf.
* Your signature. This must be your full legal name, not a pseudonym or creator handle.

This notice can be sent via email to us on our Legal Inquiries address found on the [contact page](https://kemono.party/contact).

**Failure to follow these instructions, or emailing it to the wrong department, or emailing all three departments at once will get your notice discarded.**
