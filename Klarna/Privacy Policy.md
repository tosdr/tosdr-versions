Pay it safe

Fraud detection is at the heart of Klarna's security. We can quickly respond to unusual activity on your account, and if needed, we will ask for an extra security step called a multi-factor authentication (MFA), which will ensure that it’s really you making a purchase and giving you peace of mind that your financial information is safe.

Security tips
-------------

Shopping should be fun, but it's important to be aware of potential risks to help you stay safe. That's where our security tips come into play.

We want to prevent scams and unauthorized activity from happening in the first place. These tips are straightforward and easy to apply, so don’t wait - dive into our tips to stay in the loop.

Top 4 ways to spot a scammer
----------------------------

We’ve narrowed down a few of the top ways to spot a scammer. When something doesn’t seem right - your intuition may be picking up on subtle scam signals.

1\. Unexpected messages

Scammers often initiate contact through unsolicited emails, phone calls, or text messages and extract sensitive information.

2\. Time crunch

Scammers often create a false sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking.

3\. The more you know

Before shopping or sharing personal details online, make sure the website is legit and secure.

4\. Too good to be true

Scammers may ask you to pay using gift cards, the Klarna app, or even a wire transfer with the expectation you’ll receive even more in return.

What should I do if I...?
-------------------------

I receive a suspicious email/text message?

Do not click any links or open attachments from unexpected or unverified sources. Always be cautious of communication requesting personal or financial information, demanding immediate action, or simply does not look right. If possible, flag the message as spam or junk. Your awareness and vigilance are the best lines of defense. 

I shared my personal identification or authentication code to someone I don’t know?

Immediately contact Klarna and any other relevant institutions involved to notify them about the incident. Swift action could trigger preventative measures that can avert further complications. Change all relevant passwords and monitor your financial statements closely for any signs of unauthorized activity.

I have lost my device or physical card?

Immediately contact Klarna to report the lost device or card. Freeze your card to prevent unauthorized charges. Similarly, if a device like a phone or laptop is lost, change all passwords for accounts accessible on the device and inform relevant institutions about possible unauthorized access - especially if the device is auto-logged into any financial or personal accounts. 

I see unauthorized activity on my account?

Immediately contact Klarna to report the suspicious activity. Consider changing any log-in credentials you believe could be compromised and enable additional security measures like two-factor authentication. Regularly monitoring your account for unfamiliar activity can help detect potential fraud early.

I am asked to make an urgent payment?

Always double-check before conducting any transactions, particularly those demanding urgently and unexpectedly. Contact the requester via a different, trusted method to confirm its legitimacy.

I suspect an online shopping site could be fraudulent?

Before sharing information online, research the company, check reviews, and confirm valid contact information. 

Make sure the website is legit and secure. Double check the website’s URL is spelled correctly. Also, look for "https://" in the URL which means the data you send to the site is encrypted, providing an extra layer of security. Especially when using public Wi-Fi networks. If something feels off, trust your instincts.

I clicked an unknown link and it downloaded a file?

Do not open the file. Delete it immediately and run a virus scan. Ensure you have up-to-date antivirus software installed to protect against malicious downloads. Continue to monitor your financial statements closely for any unauthorized activity.

I am contacted by someone claiming they're from a well-known company?

Always proceed with caution when contacted unexpectedly, even if they appear to be legitimate from a place you trust. If in doubt, end the conversation and independently contact the company directly using a verified method such as the customer service number listed on their official website. It’s always better to double-check before sharing any personal or financial information.
