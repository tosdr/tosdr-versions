Terms and Conditions
====================

Symmetry Electronics, a Division of Exponential Technology Group, Inc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale

1\. Acceptance and Cancellation of Orders

Each Order for Goods is subject to acceptance in writing by a duly authorized agent of Symmetry Electronics, a Division of Exponential Technology Group, Inc. (“Seller”); any written acknowledgement of receipt of an order shall not, in and of itself, constitute such acceptance. Orders accepted by Seller may be canceled by Buyer only upon written consent of Seller. Cancellations or rescheduling orders will not be accepted within 30 days of scheduled delivery. In the event of cancellation or other withdrawal of an Order for any reason and without limiting any other remedy which Seller may have as a result of such cancellation or other withdrawal, reasonable cancellation, or restocking charges, which shall include all costs incurred by Seller in fulfilling the Order, shall be paid by Buyer to Seller. Orders for Goods identified as Customer Specific Goods and/or Non-Cancelable and Non-Returnable (“NCNR”) will be identified and agreed to by Buyer at the time of order placement and such Goods will be the sole liability of the Buyer.

2\. Delivery

All prices quoted and Goods shipped are F.O.B. Seller’s facility (or in the definition of International Commercial Terms - INCOTERMS 2020; EXW (Ex Works), Seller’s facility). Title to and risk of loss of all Goods shall pass upon Seller’s delivery to carrier for shipment to Buyer. Unless otherwise agreed by Seller in writing, Buyer shall pay all freight, handling, delivery, and insurance charges for shipment of Goods. Choice of carrier and shipping method and route shall be at the election of Seller unless expressly designated in writing. The contractual date of delivery, if any, shall be extended for a period equal to the time lost as a consequence of such delay without penalty to Seller. In its sole discretion, Seller may allocate, defer, delay, or cancel the shipment of any Goods which are in short supply. Seller shall be entitled to refuse or to delay shipments upon failure by Buyer to pay promptly any payments due Seller, whether on this or any other contract between Seller and Buyer. Seller shall have the right to deliver all Goods covered hereby at one time or in portions from time to time within the time for delivery provided in such Order.

3\. Terms

Payment via major credit card (Visa, MasterCard, and American Express) is accepted, if Seller does not have established credit terms with Buyer. Terms may be available upon credit approval of submitted credit application.

Unless otherwise specified by Seller in writing, payment in full or net amount owing, without offset or deduction, is due 30 days from date of invoice or as mutually agreed to. If payment is not received within such 30-day period, a late fee of 1.5% per month (annual percentage rate of 18%) of the unpaid balance or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less, shall be paid by Buyer.

All payments are accepted subject to collection. Buyer agrees to pay Seller’s actual costs of collection, including without limitation reasonable attorney fees, costs, and third-party collection fees. Any payment received from Buyer may be applied by Seller against any obligation of Buyer to Seller under this or any other agreement, notwithstanding any statement or direction from Buyer with regard to such payment. Acceptance of any partial payment shall not constitute a waiver of Seller’s right to payment in full of all amounts owing from Buyer to Seller.

Seller shall have the right to refuse to ship to Buyer on credit at any time and shipments made to Buyer on a prepay or other basis shall be subject to the terms and conditions of sale contained herein.

4\. Inspection and Acceptance of Goods

Buyer is deemed to have accepted Goods unless written notice of rejection is given to Seller within a reasonable time, which is agreed to be within ten (10) days after receipt. CLAIMS OF LATE DELIVERY are void unless made prior to receipt of Goods, and receipt of Goods shall constitute a waiver of any claim of late delivery. No return will be accepted without prior “Return Material Authorization Number” (RMA #) from Seller with Buyer giving the reason for a return. Goods must be returned as directed by Seller’s location issuing the RMA# and be in its original packaging. Returns of Goods packaged in electrostatic packaging will not be accepted if electrostatic packaging has been opened.

5\. Seller's Right to Increase Prices

Unless otherwise specified on the face of this Agreement, Seller reserves the right to increase the selling price of any and all Goods ordered by Buyer prior to shipment from Seller’s place of business due to an increase in cost of such Goods by Seller’s Original Component Manufacturer (“OCM”) supplier. The selling price quoted to Buyer shall, upon an increase in price by Seller’s OCM supplier, be increased by the same percentage of increase in Seller’s costs for the Goods and Buyer agrees to pay any such increased price in accordance with the terms hereof.

6\. Taxes

Seller’s prices do not include sales, use, excise, or similar taxes. Seller shall properly impose upon, collect from Buyer, and timely remit to the appropriate governmental authorities any sales, use, or value added taxes, customs duties, tariffs, or similar levies, including fines and penalties (“Taxes”) applicable to Goods including Services sold, licensed, delivered, or furnished hereunder. Each Tax will be separately stated on any Seller invoice. To the extent software including documentation is delivered electronically, Seller’s invoice shall indicate the manner of delivery as “software delivered electronically to the customer” and identify locations where the software will be used if known. Invoices shall not include any Taxes for which Buyer has furnished a valid exemption certificate. If Seller receives a refund of any Taxes attributable to Buyer, Seller will promptly credit such amount to Buyer. If Seller receives notice of any additional Taxes applicable to an Order, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer.
