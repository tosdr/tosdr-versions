Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising?
--------------------------------------------

**Interest-Based Advertising.** We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We share or we permit Google Analytics, Google AdWords and MailChimp to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other devices you may use, and on other websites, apps, or services, including on Facebook. The information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, whether you log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

We also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google AdWords. These features enable us to use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Service.  
For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's site "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps" located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can learn about Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at [https://google.com/ads/preferences](https://google.com/ads/preferences), or by visiting NAI's online resources at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

**Social Media Widgets and Advertising.** Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.  
We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while those users are on the social media platform or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.

**Cross-Device Linking.** We, or our third-party partners Google Analytics, Google AdWords and MailChimp, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service. Our third-party partners employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as a cookie id) with third-party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.

**Your Choices:**

**Interest-based advertising.** To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative's online resources at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and/or the DAA's resources at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). You may also manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the EU-based Your Online Choices at [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

**Cross-device linking.** Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI's and DAA's online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.

**Mobile advertising** . You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting "limit ad tracking" (iOS) or "opt-out of interest based ads" (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some-but not all-interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.

Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.
