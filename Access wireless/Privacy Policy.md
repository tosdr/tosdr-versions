Access Wireless (“Access Wireless,” “**we**,” “**our,**” or “**us**”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is provided to help you better understand the kinds of information Access Wireless collects from and about you when you visit our Website (“Site”), use our mobile applications (each an “App”) and use our online services, devices, products, or services (collectively referred to as the “Services”). 

This Privacy Policy applies to you and anyone who a) applies for Wireless Services or government benefits available for eligible applicants in conjunction with our Services; and/or b) uses our Services under your account, except where we identify for you that separate terms and conditions apply. 

Please take a moment to review the full terms of our Privacy Policy below, because by accessing and using the Site containing a link to this Privacy Policy, or by using our Services where a link to this Privacy Policy is provided, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and any updates we make to it.

#### **6\. HOW YOU MIGHT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES**

When using our Services, you may choose to install, access, or use services offered by third parties, such as websites and applications. Please also refer to the Acceptable Use Policy inside our Terms and Conditions, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/terms-and-conditions](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/terms-and-conditions). In some cases, our Services may have links to websites operated by third parties, plugins for social media services, or third-party advertisements. 

When you interact with third-party services, you may be consenting to those third parties accessing, collecting, using, or disclosing your Personal Information through our Services or directing us to share or allow access to your Personal Information by those third parties, such as your IP address, browsing activity, or location information. Those services operate independently of our Services, and your Personal Information will be governed by their terms and conditions, including their privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services that you use to better understand their privacy practices. You may be able to restrict or disable the use and disclosure of certain information, such as your location information, using settings available on your Device or through the third-party services.

#### **7\. YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO YOUR CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION**

CPNI is information made available to us solely by virtue of our relationship with you that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, geolocation data, and amount of use of the telecommunications services you purchase from us, as well as information related to the billing for those services. 

CPNI does not include subscriber list information such as name, postal address, or telephone number. Under federal law, you have the right, and we have the duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. When we share your CPNI with our service providers or contractors, we require them to take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of that information. 

We are permitted to use or disclose your CPNI for certain purposes without further notice or consent from you, including: to provide you with our Services; to market service offerings to you related to the services you purchase; to protect us, you, other subscribers, and other carriers from fraud, abuse, or unlawful use of the Services; and in an aggregate form. We also may use your CPNI, or share it with affiliates and third-party agents, for the purpose of offering you communications-related products and services, packages, discounts, and promotions that may be different from the types of services you have already purchased. 

You have the right to opt out of use of your CPNI for marketing purposes and can submit an opt-out request by contacting us by calling 866-594-3644 or filling out the Contact Us form, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us](https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us). Opting out will not affect our provision of Services to you or our use of your CPNI for permitted purposes. If you choose to opt-out, your choice is valid until you choose to opt in. You may also contact us to correct your CPNI or request that we disclose your CPNI to you. 

We will not disclose your CPNI except when provided with your password, and we may implement other authentication measures. If you do not provide a password, we may not release your CPNI to you except by sending it to your address of record or by calling you at your telephone number of record. Be sure to use a strong password with our Services and not one you use for other services. We may disclose your CPNI to any “authorized user” that you have designated to us in writing or to any person who is able to provide us with your password.

#### **8\. YOUR ADVERTISING CHOICES AND CONSENT OPTIONS**

**Google Analytics and Google AdWords.** We may use Google Analytics on our Sites to help us analyze traffic and improve services. For more information on Google Analytics’ processing of Personal Information, please see [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You may opt-out of the use of Google Analytics here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

Our Sites also use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Sites. Any data we collect will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and Google is responsible to abide by its own privacy policy. You can set your preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page: [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/).

You have certain choices and consent options related to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information for advertising purposes. Exercising these choices and options will not affect our provision of Services to you. Please note that these choices and options may not prevent you from receiving all advertising; you may continue to receive generic advertising from us or interest-based advertising from third parties, depending on how they operate. 

**Interest-Based Advertising.** You have choices and options concerning interest-based advertising on our Services or across other websites and online services as follows:

* To opt-out of collection and use of your Personal Information for interest-based advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), please visit optout.aboutads.info or click on the DAA icon when you see it on an online ad.
* To opt-out from the use of Personal Information about your online activities for interest-based advertising by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) member companies, please visit optout.networkadvertising.org. 
* To opt-out of the use of your mobile device ID for targeted advertising, please visit www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
* To prevent your Personal Information from being used by Google Analytics to measure and improve marketing and advertising and understand the use of our Services, including through Google AdWords, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform Integrations, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, add the Google Analytics opt-out plugin to your browser, available at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. 

* To manage flash cookies, visit Adobe’s [Global Privacy Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html).

* You may be able to adjust your browser, computer, or device settings to disable cookies, remove or prevent the storage of HTML5, or control other advertising and analytics technology to stop or reduce the amount of interest-based advertising you receive, but doing so may prevent you from using certain features of our Services.

**Marketing Communications.** In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, you provide consent for us to contact you via email, voice call or text, including manual, autodialed, and prerecorded calls and texts. You also provide consent for us to use CPNI for marketing purposes, as described in the Terms and Conditions. You may limit or revoke these authorizations as follows:

* Call us at 866-594-3644.
* Unsubscribe from our email communications following the unsubscribe instructions contained within our emails.
* Reply “STOP” to our text messages.

Your instructions to opt-out from these communications will be processed as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that exercising a marketing opt-out will not affect the services you receive and will not affect our right to contact you about the services to which you subscribe, including notifications regarding compliance obligations related to those services (_e.g_., non-usage, de-enrollment, and collection notices). 

**Do Not Track.** Because Do Not Track (“DNT”) and similar signals do not yet operate according to common, industry-accepted standards, our Services may not respond to DNT signals.

#### **9\. HOW WE STORE, RETAIN, AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU, AND HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Access Wireless has implemented technology and security features, such as encryption, to safeguard the privacy of your customer specific information from unauthorized access or improper use and will continue to enhance our security measures as technology becomes available. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as foolproof security on the Internet, and therefore, Access Wireless makes no guarantees with regard to the sufficiency of our security measures.

We will keep your Personal Information as long as necessary to provide your Services, or as otherwise required by federal or state law, subpoena, or court order. 

FCC regulations require us to keep:

* Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”) records for as long as an ACP participant receives a discount but no less than six (6) years.
* 911 call data for two (2) years.

The Personal Information we collect from or about you is stored on servers which we take commercially reasonable efforts to secure in the United States (“U.S.”), subject to the laws of the U.S. Electronic access to the databases and physical access to the servers on which this Personal Information is stored are restricted to those employees, agents, contractors, service providers, and other third parties who have a business need for such access. They will only access and use your Personal Information based on our instructions and they are required to keep your Personal Information confidential. While we take reasonable steps to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and servers, we cannot guarantee their security, nor can we guarantee that your communications and information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over our underlying carrier’s network or the Internet. 

Your Personal Information is stored on servers in the U.S.; however, some of our service providers may store information on servers hosted in other countries. As such, your Personal Information may be subject to the laws of other countries, where the data protection and other laws may differ from those of the U.S. Should your Personal Information be transferred to other countries, we will require our service providers to protect your Personal Information. Your Personal Information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the countries in which we operate.

Access Wireless may assign you a user ID and a password when you as part of your participation and access to the Site and your account. Only you may use your user ID and password. You may not share your user ID and password with anyone else, and you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of your user ID and password. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user ID. You play a role in protecting your information as well.

#### **10\. GOVERNING LAW AND NOTICE TO NON-U.S. RESIDENTS**

Our Services are solely intended for individuals located within the U.S. and its territories and are subject to U.S. law. If you are located outside of the U.S. and its territories, please do not use the Services. 

If you do not reside in the U.S. and provide Personal Information to us, please note that your Personal Information will be transferred, processed, collected, used, accessed and/or stored in the U.S. and subject to U.S. laws. The laws in the U.S. may not provide the same protections for your Personal Information as the jurisdiction in which you are located. Do not provide your Personal Information to us if you do not want this information to be transferred or processed outside of your country, or if the laws in your country restrict such transfers.

#### **11\. INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**

Our Services are not directed toward children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in California). 

If you are a minor, please do not provide us with any Personal Information or use or access the Services without receiving your parent’s or guardian’s permission. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 in California), we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Information provided by a child under 13 (or under the age of 16 in California), or if you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13 (or under the age of 16 in California) that has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us by calling 866-594-3644 or filling out the Contact Us form, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us](https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us).

For clarification, you (as a customer) may provide us information about children within your family, such as school enrollment or school breakfast/lunch documentation, to qualify for the ACP or Lifeline. That information may be collected and stored by our service providers and provided to the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC).

#### **12\. ACCESS WIRELESS AND VARIOUS STATE PRIVACY LAWS**

We are not subject to the defined scope of many state privacy laws, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”) or the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CDPA”), and therefore the specific rights and obligations identified in these laws do not currently apply to us. However, residents of these states may refer to these Privacy Policy provisions regarding our current data practices and may contact us regarding data inquiries or further information requests via the Our Contact Information section below. We also recognize that privacy laws continue to evolve rapidly, so we are undertaking reasonable means to monitor developments in these laws and update our polices accordingly.

#### **13\. CALIFORNIA RESIDENT PRIVACY RIGHTS**

California residents have certain additional rights under the CCPA as described below, to the extent that we:

(i) generate over $25 million in annual gross revenue;

(ii) process the personal information of at least 100,000 California consumers; or

(iii) generate 50% or more of our annual revenues from the sale or sharing of personal information.

You may inquire whether these thresholds have been met by contacting us at 866-594-3644 or filling out the Contact Us form, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us](https://www.accesswireless.com/contact-us). To the extent the threshold has been met, you may exercise these rights.

This section explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information about users, customers, and visitors who reside in California (“consumers” or “you”). It also explains certain rights afforded to consumers under California’s Shine the Light law and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as revised and updated by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”). This section uses certain terms that have the meaning given to them in the CCPA including personal information. “Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy is as defined by applicable laws. 

The following section does not apply to individuals who do not live in California on a permanent basis, individuals who do not collect personal information about, or individuals for whom all of the information we collect is exempt from California laws.

**13.1. Categories of Personal Information Collected**

We may collect (and have collected during the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy) the above categories of Personal Information about you in the Types of Personal Information We Collect About You section above.

**13.2. Sources of Personal Information**

During the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, have obtained Personal Information about you from the sources identified in The Personal Information We Collect section above.

**13.3. Purpose of Collection**

We used during the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy your Personal Information for the business or commercial purposes described in the **How We Use** Personal Information We Collect About You section above.

**13.4. Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose**

We may disclose your Personal Information to a contractor or service provider for a business purpose. 

When we disclose Personal Information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that prohibits any such contractor or service provider from selling or sharing your Personal Information. Any such contract requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.

During the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have disclosed the categories of Personal Information about you for a business purpose as described in the **How** We Share or Allow Access to Your Personal Information section above.

**13.5. Sale and Sharing of Personal Information**

We do not sell or share your Personal Information in exchange for monetary consideration. 

However, the definitions of Personal Information, ‘share,’ and ‘sale’ under CCPA are broad. The CCPA defines “sharing” as “communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information” to “a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for money or other valuable consideration.” We may share your Personal Information with a third party to help serve personalized content or ads that may be more relevant to your interests, and to perform other advertising-related services such as enabling our partners to serve such personalized content.

We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age. 

During the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have shared the following categories of Personal Information as follows:

|     |     |     |

_Verifying Requests_

You may request to exercise your rights under this Privacy Policy by contacting us as described in the Our Contact Information section below. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before processing your request. If you request access to or deletion of your Personal Information, we may require you to provide any of the following information: name, date of birth, email address, telephone number, or postal address.

* In certain cases, a request for access, correction, or deletion may be denied.

If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it and delete any other information that is not protected and subject to denial.

Access Wireless is a service provider for the government-funded Lifeline Assistance program. Lifeline service is provided by i-wireless LLC, d/b/a Access Wireless, an eligible telecommunications carrier. Lifeline service is non-transferable. Only one Lifeline discount, consisting of either wireline or wireless service, can be received per household. A household is defined, for the purposes of the Lifeline program, as any individual or group of individuals who live together at the same address and share income and expenses. Violation of the one-per-household rule constitutes a violation of FCC rules and will result in the customer’s de-enrollment from the Lifeline program. Consumers who willfully make false statements in order to obtain a Lifeline benefit can be punished by fine or imprisonment or can be barred from the program. Customers must present proper documentation confirming their eligibility for the Lifeline program. Customer information will be validated against public records and any discrepancies could result in your approval or rejection of service.
