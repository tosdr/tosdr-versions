**Last Updated:** July 1, 2024  
  

This Agreement governs the provision of the Services by Access Wireless (“Access Wireless” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) to you (“your,” “applicant,” “customer,” “subscriber,” “participant,” or “user”) and your use of the Services and Devices. As used in this Agreement, the term: (A) “Services” means voice telephony (“talk”), text messaging (“text”), broadband Internet access services (“data”), and any other services provided to you by Access Wireless, services and devices subject to federal and state Lifeline discounts and Affordable Connectivity Program discounts, and prepaid wireless service; (B) “Device” means any phone, smartphone, accessory, or other device provided or sold to you by Access Wireless or that you activate or use with our Services (note that certain functions are only available when using a voice enabled Device; tablets provided or sold to you by Access Wireless are not voice enabled); and (C) “Underlying Carrier” means the wireless provider whose facilities we use to provide you wireless Services. The complete Agreement between you and Access Wireless consists of:

1. these Terms and Conditions, including the Acceptable Use Policy and the binding arbitration clause;
2. any terms of service associated with your selected Service Plan;
3. the Access Wireless Privacy Policy, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy);

#### **1. FEDERAL LIFELINE PROGRAM**

**1.1. Program Description**

Lifeline is a government assistance program that is supported by the federal Universal Service Fund and is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”). The federal Lifeline program provides discounts on monthly communications services for eligible consumers, including voice calls, text messages, and broadband Internet access services. Discounts are applied to the retail rates of Access Wireless Lifeline Service Plans (discussed in Section 3) for eligible Access Wireless subscribers. In some states, Lifeline service is also supported by discounts available from state universal service funds and may be administered by state administrators.

**1.2. Application Process**

To request enrollment in Access Wireless’s Lifeline-supported services, you must complete a Lifeline service application. The application requires that you certify, under penalty of perjury, that you understand and agree to the laws, regulations, and other requirements for receiving Lifeline services. By completing an application, you consent to Access Wireless or its representatives assisting you with applying for Lifeline services or doing so on your behalf and to the release of any information (e.g., name, telephone number, address, and eligibility information) necessary to process your application or for administration of Lifeline services to federal and state government entities, USAC, or other administrators of the Lifeline program. Failure to consent will result in denial of Lifeline services. This consent is ongoing while you are an Access Wireless Lifeline subscriber and survives any termination of this Agreement.

**1.3. Eligibility**

To be eligible for Access Wireless Lifeline Services, you must meet the applicable eligibility standards. For the federal Lifeline program, eligibility standards are determined by federal regulation. For state-specific Lifeline programs, eligibility standards are determined by the appropriate state body and vary by state. These state and federal eligibility requirements include program-based eligibility or income-based eligibility. You must also be at least 18 years old (unless you are an emancipated minor) and must not be listed as a dependent on another person’s tax return (unless over the age of 60). Eligibility is determined when applicants enroll in federal and state eligibility databases, which may request documentation as evidence of an applicant’s eligibility. Acceptable documentation is determined by USAC and state third-party administrators and will be explained to you when such documentation is requested.

**Program-Based Eligibility** – Access Wireless subscribers may qualify for program-based eligibility if they participate in one or more of the following programs:

a) Programs applicable to all subscribers:

1\. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  
2\. Section 8 Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)  
3\. Medicaid (not Medicare)  
4\. Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  
5\. Veterans and Survivors Pension Benefit

b) Additional programs applicable to subscribers residing on Tribal lands:

1\. Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)  
2\. Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance (BIA)  
3\. Tribally Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  
4\. Tribal Head Start (meeting income qualifying standards)

**Income-Based Eligibility** – You may qualify for income-based eligibility if your total gross income is at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. Federal regulations define “gross income” as all income actually received by all members of the household from whatever source derived, unless specifically excluded by the Internal Revenue Code.

**1.4. One Per Household Rule**

Under federal law, only one Lifeline benefit is permitted per household, which may be applied to wireless or landline service. For purposes of the Lifeline program, a household is defined as any individual or group of individuals who live together at the same address and share income and expenses. Separate households that live at the same address are eligible, including, for example, residents of homeless shelters and nursing homes. A household is not permitted to receive Lifeline benefits from multiple providers, but the Lifeline benefit associated with your household may be transferred from another provider to Access Wireless.

**1.5. Availability**

Access Wireless’s Lifeline service is only available to applicants who reside in the areas in which Access Wireless has been designated as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (“ETC”). To receive Lifeline service through Access Wireless, an applicant’s principal and permanent residential address must be within Access Wireless’s ETC service area. Applicants cannot apply for Lifeline service using a second home or business address. If you move to a new address, you must provide that new address to Access Wireless within 30 days of moving. Visit [https://www.accesswireless.com](https://www.accesswireless.com/) to check whether you reside in Access Wireless’s ETC service area.

**1.6. Annual Recertification**

Lifeline subscribers are required to recertify, on an annual basis from the date of their service initiation, that they continue to meet eligibility requirements and other qualifications to receive Lifeline services. Recertification is conducted or facilitated by USAC or state third-party administrators, but Access Wireless may send you text messages reminding you to complete your recertification. If a subscriber fails to complete the annual recertification by the deadline, Access Wireless will notify the subscriber that the subscriber will be de-enrolled from the Lifeline program. If the subscriber fails to recertify by the deadline or no longer meets eligibility requirements or other qualifications, the subscriber will be de-enrolled from the Lifeline program and the phone number the subscriber was using may be assigned to another subscriber. To continue utilizing the Services, the subscriber may re-enroll in the Access Wireless Lifeline Program, if eligible, or choose from any of the then available prepaid plans under the applicable terms and conditions for that plan. Upon re-enrollment, the subscriber may be assigned a new phone number.

**1.7. Ongoing Eligibility Verification**

You must notify Access Wireless within 30 days if for any reason you no longer satisfy the criteria for receiving Lifeline services, including if (1) you no longer meet the income-based or program-based eligibility criteria, or (2) you or a member of your household begins receiving another Lifeline benefit. Access Wireless may conduct checks to verify your continued eligibility for receiving Lifeline service at any time. If we determine that you no longer satisfy the criteria, we will de-enroll you from Access Wireless’s Lifeline service and deactivate your Services.

**1.8. Non-Transferable and Non-Assignable**

Eligibility for Access Wireless is personal to you. Under federal law, you may not transfer to any third party any of your rights or benefits received under the Access Wireless Service, including, but not limited to, any voice, text, or data allotments you receive to use the Access Wireless Services. Similarly, you may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties to any third party, including any individual that may be eligible to receive Lifeline service, without the prior written consent of Access Wireless, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void. Access Wireless may assign all or part of these terms or your debts to us without notice.

**1.9. Service Activation**

Access Wireless will not consider your service to be activated until you complete one of the following actions: 1) call 611 from the Device to our interactive voice response (IVR); 2) initiate data usage; or 3) respond to instructions from Access Wireless to activate the service.

**1.10. Usage Requirement**

To maintain Access Wireless Lifeline service, FCC regulations require that, unless a subscriber has a regular billing and payment relationship with us, the subscriber must use the service every 30 days. Subscribers can “use” the Services by: (1) completing an outbound call, sending a text message, or using data; (2) purchasing minutes or data from Access Wireless to add to the subscriber’s service plan; (3) answering an incoming call from a party other than Access Wireless; or (4) responding to direct contact from Access Wireless and confirming that the subscriber wants to continue receiving the Lifeline service. At or before 30 days of non-use, Access Wireless will provide subscribers with notice that failure to use the Lifeline services within a 15-day notice period will result in de-enrollment. Access Wireless may also send text messages reminding a subscriber to use the service. If a subscriber does not respond to the notice or use the service before the end of the 15-day notice period, Access Wireless is required to and will de-enroll the subscriber from Lifeline service. At that time, the subscriber’s Services will be deactivated, except that the subscriber still will be able to use a voice enabled Device associated with the Services to contact 911 emergency services, provided it is charged and able to connect to a wireless network.

**1.11. Fraud and Violation of Lifeline Rules**

Lifeline is a federal benefit and any violation of federal or state Lifeline laws and regulations can result in fines, imprisonment, de-enrollment, or permanently being barred from the program. Willfully providing false or fraudulent information to obtain or continue to receive Lifeline benefits, violating the one-per-household limitation, or otherwise violating or failing to follow the Lifeline requirements or limitations all constitute violations of federal or state Lifeline laws or regulations. Access Wireless may suspend or de-enroll you from receiving Lifeline-supported service, without notice, if we suspect or determine that you have engaged in fraud or violated any Lifeline laws or regulations.

**1.12. De-enrollment**

In addition to de-enrollment for any of the reasons described above, you may request to be de-enrolled from Lifeline service for any reason and at any time by contacting Access Wireless Customer Service. De-enrollment requests (including name, wireless number, and identity related information) can be made by phone (dialing 611 from your Access Wireless Device or calling toll-free at 866-594-3644), physical mail (Access Wireless, One Levee Way Suite 1122, Newport, KY 41071), or electronically (via our website at [https://www.accesswireless.com/](https://www.accesswireless.com/)). Upon receiving a request, you will be de-enrolled within five (5) business days. Upon de-enrollment from the Lifeline program, you will no longer receive free minutes, text messages, or data each month and will be required to re-qualify for Lifeline service if you choose to enroll in another Access Wireless Lifeline service plan. Additionally, a subscriber may be de-enrolled at the request of a federal or state government authority.

**1.13. Lifeline Benefit Transfer**

You may transfer your Lifeline benefit from another Lifeline provider to Access Wireless or from Access Wireless to another Lifeline provider. Access Wireless complies with the FCC’s rules regarding transferring Lifeline benefits.

#### **2\. AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM**

**2.1. Program Description**

The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) is a government assistance program administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). The ACP program provides discounts on monthly communications services for eligible consumers, including voice calls, text messages, and broadband Internet access services. The ACP presently provides discounts of up to $30 per eligible household on monthly broadband Internet access service (or up to $75 per eligible household on Tribal lands). Eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price. Discounts are applied to the retail rates of Access Wireless’s Service Plans (discussed in Section 3) for eligible Access Wireless subscribers. 

**2.2. Application Process**

To request enrollment in Access Wireless’s ACP-supported services, you must complete an ACP service application. The application requires that you certify, under penalty of perjury, that you understand and agree to the laws, regulations, and other requirements for receiving ACP services. By submitting an application, you consent to Access Wireless or its representatives assisting you with applying for ACP services or doing so on your behalf and to the release necessary information (e.g., name, telephone number, address, and eligibility information) to process your application or for administration of ACP services to federal government entities, or USAC. Failure to consent will result in denial of ACP services. 

This consent is ongoing while you are an Access Wireless ACP subscriber and survives any termination of this Agreement. Access Wireless addresses subscriber data use and subscriber privacy rights in detail in its Privacy Policy, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy). Access Wireless’s Privacy Policy is incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. 

**2.3. Eligibility**

You must meet the applicable eligibility standards to be eligible for Access Wireless’s ACP services. ACP eligibility standards are determined by federal law and regulations. These eligibility requirements include program-based eligibility or income-based eligibility. You must also be at least 18 years old (unless you are an emancipated minor) and must not be listed as a dependent on another person’s tax return (unless over the age of 60). 

Eligibility is determined when applicants enroll in eligibility databases, which may request documentation as evidence of an applicant’s eligibility. Acceptable documentation is determined by USAC and third-party administrators and will be explained to you when such documentation is requested.

**2.3.1. ACP Program-Based Eligibility**

a) Programs applicable to all subscribers:

1\. Lifeline Program  
2\. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  
3\. Federal Public Housing Assistance (FPHA)  
4\. Medicaid (not Medicare)  
5\. Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  
6\. Veterans and Survivors Pension Benefits  
7\. Federal Pell Grant in the current award year

b) Additional programs applicable to subscribers residing on Tribal lands:

1\. Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)  
2\. Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance (BIA)  
3\. Tribally Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  
4\. Tribal Head Start (meeting income qualifying standards)

**2.4. Income-Based Eligibility**

You may qualify for the ACP based on income (income-based eligibility) if your total gross income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. Please visit USAC’s [eligibility website for details](https://www.affordableconnectivity.gov/do-i-qualify/). Federal regulations define “gross income” as all income actually received by all members of the household from whatever source derived, unless specifically excluded by the Internal Revenue Code.

**2.5. One Per Household Rule**

Under federal law, only one ACP benefit is permitted per household, which may be applied to wireless or landline service. For purposes of the ACP program, a household is defined as any individual or group of individuals who live together at the same address and share income and expenses. Separate households that live at the same address are eligible, including, for example, residents of homeless shelters and nursing homes. A household is not permitted to receive ACP benefits from multiple providers, but the ACP benefit associated with your household may be transferred from another provider to Access Wireless, subject to certain restrictions.

**2.6. Availability**

To receive ACP service through Access Wireless, an applicant’s principal and permanent residential address must be within Access Wireless’s service area. Applicants cannot apply for ACP service using a second home or business address. If you move to a new address, you must provide that new address to Access Wireless within 30 days of moving. Visit [https://www.accesswireless.com/](https://www.accesswireless.com/) to check whether you reside in Access Wireless’s service area.

**2.7. Annual Recertification**

ACP subscribers are required to recertify, on an annual basis (once per calendar year), that they continue to meet eligibility requirements and other qualifications to receive ACP services. Recertification is conducted or facilitated by USAC, but Access Wireless may send you text messages and other communications reminding you to complete your recertification. If a subscriber fails to complete the annual recertification by the deadline, Access Wireless will notify the subscriber that the subscriber will be de-enrolled from the ACP. If the subscriber fails to recertify by the deadline or no longer meets eligibility requirements or other qualifications, the subscriber will be de-enrolled from the ACP, and the phone number the subscriber was using may be assigned to another subscriber. To continue utilizing the Services, the subscriber may re-enroll in the Access Wireless ACP, if eligible, or choose from any of the then available prepaid plans under the applicable terms and conditions for that plan. Upon re-enrollment, the subscriber may be assigned a new phone number.

**2.8. Ongoing Eligibility Verification**

You must notify Access Wireless within 30 days if for any reason you no longer satisfy the criteria for receiving ACP services, including if (1) you no longer meet the income-based or program-based eligibility criteria, or (2) you or a member of your household begins receiving another ACP benefit. Access Wireless may conduct checks to verify your continued eligibility for receiving ACP service at any time. If we determine that you no longer satisfy the criteria, we will de-enroll you from Access Wireless’s ACP service and deactivate your Services.

**2.9. Non-Transferable and Non-Assignable**

Eligibility for Access Wireless’s services is personal to you. Under federal law, you may not transfer to any third party any of your rights or benefits received under the Access Wireless Service, including, but not limited to, any voice, text, or data allotments you receive to use the Access Wireless Services. Similarly, you may not assign your rights or delegate any of your duties to any third party, including any individual that may be eligible to receive ACP service, without the prior written consent of Access Wireless, and any attempted assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void. Access Wireless may assign all or part of these terms or your debts to us without notice.

**2.10. Service Activation**

Access Wireless will not consider your service to be activated until you complete one of the following actions: 1) call 611 from the Device to our interactive voice response (IVR); 2) initiate data usage; or 3) respond to instructions from Access Wireless to activate the service.

**2.11. Usage Requirement**

To maintain Access Wireless ACP service, FCC regulations require that, unless a subscriber has a regular billing and payment relationship with us, the subscriber must use the service every 30 days. Subscribers can “use” the Services by: (1) completing an outbound call, sending a text message, or using data; (2) purchasing minutes or data from Access Wireless to add to the subscriber’s service plan; (3) answering an incoming call from a party other than Access Wireless; or (4) responding to direct contact from Access Wireless and confirming that the subscriber wants to continue receiving the ACP service. ACP-supported connected devices (e.g., discounted tablets) are not talk/text enabled and will not support traditional talk and text over the cellular network. At or before 30 days of non-use, Access Wireless will provide subscribers with notice that failure to use the ACP services within a 15-day notice period will result in de-enrollment. Access Wireless may also send text messages reminding a subscriber to use the service. If a subscriber does not respond to the notice or use the service before the end of the 15-day notice period, Access Wireless is required to and will de-enroll the subscriber from the ACP. At that time, the subscriber’s Services will be deactivated, except that the subscriber still will be able to use a voice enabled Device associated with the Services to contact 911 emergency services, provided it is charged and able to connect to a wireless network.

**2.12. Non-Payment**

Access Wireless may offer prepaid and postpaid wireless services. For postpaid services, Access Wireless may disconnect the subscriber’s ACP-supported service after 90 consecutive days of non-payment. At or before 90 days of non-payment, Access Wireless may provide subscribers with notice that failure to pay will result in de-enrollment. Access Wireless may also send text messages reminding a subscriber to pay for their ACP-supported service. If payment is not made, the subscriber’s Services will be deactivated, except that the subscriber still will be able to use a voice enabled Device associated with the Services to contact 911 emergency services, provided it is charged and able to connect to a wireless network. Please also see Section 5 below, regarding Access Wireless’s Charges and Payments terms.

**2.13. Fraud and Violation of ACP Rules**

The ACP is a federal benefit, and any violation of ACP laws and regulations can result in fines, imprisonment, de-enrollment, or permanently being barred from the program. Willfully providing false or fraudulent information to obtain or continue to receive ACP benefits, violating the one-per-household limitation, or otherwise violating or failing to follow ACP requirements or limitations all constitute violations of federal ACP laws or regulations. Access Wireless may suspend or de-enroll you from receiving ACP-supported service, without notice, if we suspect or determine that you have engaged in fraud or violated any ACP laws or regulations.

**2.14. ACP Termination or Concurrent Service**

The subscriber will be subject to Access Wireless’s undiscounted rates and general Terms and Conditions if the ACP ends, if the subscriber transfers their benefit to another provider but continues to receive service from Access Wireless, or upon de-enrollment from the ACP.

If the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) terminates ACP funding (or if funding for the ACP is otherwise exhausted), Access Wireless will notify the subscriber. In that event, the subscriber will have the option of subscribing to Access Wireless’s services at standard rates, as described in Section 5 below; or terminating your services with Access Wireless entirely.

**2.15. De-enrollment**

In addition to de-enrollment for any of the reasons described in these Terms and Conditions, you may request to be de-enrolled from ACP service for any reason and at any time by contacting Access Wireless Customer Service. De-enrollment requests (including name, wireless number, and identity related information) can be made by phone (dialing 611 from your Access Wireless Device or calling toll-free at 866-594-3644), physical mail at One Levee Way Suite 1122, Newport, KY 41071, or electronically (via our website at [https://www.accesswireless.com/](https://www.accesswireless.com/)). Upon receiving a request, you will be de-enrolled within two (2) business days. Upon de-enrollment from the ACP program, you will no longer receive free minutes, text messages, or data each month and will be required to re-qualify for ACP service if you choose to enroll in another Access Wireless ACP service plan. Additionally, a subscriber may be de-enrolled at the request of a federal government authority.

**2.16. ACP Benefit Transfer**

You may transfer your ACP benefit from another ACP provider to Access Wireless or from Access Wireless to another ACP provider. Access Wireless complies with the FCC’s rules regarding transferring ACP benefits. The effect of an ACP benefit transfer is that the subscriber’s ACP benefit will be applied to Access Wireless’s ACP service and will no longer be applied to service from the subscriber’s former ACP service provider. Subscribers transferring ACP benefits to Access Wireless may be subject to their former ACP provider’s undiscounted rates as a result of the transfer if the subscriber elects to maintain service from that provider. ACP rules limit subscribers to one ACP benefit transfer transaction per service month, with limited exceptions for situations where a subscriber seeks to reverse an unauthorized benefit transfer or is unable to receive service from a specific provider. 

**2.17. FCC Consumer Complaint Center**

In addition to the resources outlined in Section 12 of these Terms and Conditions, subscribers with complaints related to Access Wireless’s ACP services may file a complaint via the FCC’s Consumer Complaint Center. The FCC Consumer Complaint Center is available at: [https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us).

#### **3. SERVICE PLANS and “TOP UP” PLANS**

**3.1. Service Plans**

Except as otherwise described in this Agreement, you must be enrolled in a Service Plan to utilize our Services. Wireless Service Plan descriptions, including rates and associated talk, text, and data allotments (collectively, “Allotments”), are available on the Access Wireless website at [https://www.accesswireless.com/](https://www.accesswireless.com/). Service Plan availability, rates, and Allotments may vary by state and are subject to change at any time. You may not be eligible for certain Service Plans or rates. Service Plans that include allocations of voice minutes include caller ID, voicemail, call waiting, and 3-way calling. ACP and Lifeline discounts are automatically applied to the retail rate of the Service Plan you select, and you must pay any additional co-pay. Service Plans are non-refundable, cannot be transferred to any third party (including another Access Wireless account or customer), and may not be exchanged or resold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Access Wireless may, from time to time, provide refunds in its sole discretion. New subscribers select a Service Plan upon enrollment and existing subscribers can contact Customer Service to change their Service Plan by dialing 611 from their Access Wireless Device or calling toll-free at 866-594-3644. Service Plan changes are usually effective at the start of the next monthly service renewal date. 

**3.2. “Top up” Plans**

Access Wireless wireless subscribers can purchase “Top up” Plans to receive allotments of talk, text, and data by signing into your MyAccount from [www.accesswireless.com](http://www.accesswireless.com/) or by calling Access Wireless Customer Services by dialing 866-594-3644 or 611 from your Access Wireless wireless device. “Top up” Plans, including rates and associated talk, text, and data allotments, are available on the Access Wireless website at [https://www.accesswireless.com/](https://www.accesswireless.com/). “Top up” Plan availability, rates, and Allotments may vary by state and are subject to change at any time. “Top up” Plans are non-refundable, cannot be transferred to any third party (including another Access Wireless account or customer), and may not be exchanged or resold.

**3.3. Talk, Text, and Data Allotments**

Talk, text, and data allotments have no cash value, are non-refundable, cannot be transferred to any third party (including another Access Wireless account or customer), and may not be exchanged, resold, redeemed, or substituted for cash, merchandise, or services. If you terminate your service, you will forfeit and are not entitled to a full or partial refund for any unused Allotments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Access Wireless may, from time to time, provide refunds in its sole discretion. If you use your full talk, text, or data allotment before the start of a new monthly cycle, the Service associated that allotment with be suspended for the remainder of the monthly cycle, except that you will be able to continue contacting emergency services by dialing 911 and Access Wireless Customer Services by dialing 866-594-3644 or 611. Suspensions may occur while you are engaged in calls, text communications, or data usage, in which case, Access Wireless is not responsible for any costs, losses, or damages caused by such interruptions, including to reestablish communications. You may check your Allotment balances at any time free of charge by dialing 611 from your Access Wireless Device or calling 866-594-3644. You are responsible for all usage of Allotments regardless of who uses or possesses your Device and regardless of whether the Device is used with your consent or knowledge. Unused Service Plan Allotments, including Top Up Allotments, expire on the last day of your monthly cycle and will not carry over to the next monthly cycle unless specifically provided for by the Service Plan. 

**3.4. Reduced Speeds**

Access Wireless may offer plans with data at reduced speeds. After any high-speed data allotment is used, speeds will be reduced to 256 kbps-equivalent until the end of your billing cycle. Subscribers that consume an additional 20GB of data at 256kbps speed will be further reduced down to 125kbps until the end of the billing cycle. You can upgrade your plan at any time to a plan with a higher high-speed data allotment, or you can add a data top up to your account at any time. This included allotment will be available until used or for 30 days from the date of purchase, whichever comes first. You may notice changes in the performance of certain applications when you are on reduced speed usage. You are responsible for all data activity to and from your device, regardless of who initiates the activity. Some tips for conserving your data usage: (1) Use Wi-Fi whenever possible; (2) Download music to the device for offline use and avoid music streaming services like Pandora when not using Wi-Fi; (3) Only stream video like YouTube and Netflix when using Wi-Fi. Otherwise, you can download the video to your device while using Wi-Fi for later offline viewing.

**3.5. Use of Voice Allotments**

All incoming and outgoing voice calls on your Device, regardless of whether the call is on the network of our Underlying Carrier or roaming, use talk minute allotments, including calls to toll-free numbers but excluding 911 emergency calls, Access Wireless Customer Service Calls to 611 and 866-594-3644, and other calls specified herein. Call time is measured in one-minute increments, with a minimum time per call of one (1) minute. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next full­ minute at the end of each call. Access Wireless does not allow free calls to other Access Wireless subscribers. Outgoing calls begin the moment you initiate a call and incoming calls begin the moment the signal connection from the caller is established with our facilities. Calls end after you or the other party terminates the call, but not until we receive a signal that the call has disconnected. Call length information displayed on your Device may not be accurate for calculating use of voice allotments. For simultaneous calls (incoming call waiting calls and 3-ways calls), talk minutes may be deducted for each call. Call time may include ring time, incomplete calls, unanswered calls, busy signal calls, voicemail deposit and retrieval time, and time to process call transfers. Calls that begin during one monthly cycle and end in another monthly cycle are generally deducted from talk allotments from the starting monthly cycle. No credit or refund is given for dropped calls.

**3.6. Use of Data Allotments**

All data usage that occurs through your wireless Device (except for data usage that occurs when your Device is connected to Wi-Fi provided by a third party) will be deducted from your data allotment, including all active and passive usage, regardless of who initiates the usage, and whether or not the data transmissions are successful. All data usage is calculated in full-kilobyte increments and actual usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session. Data usage may occur whenever your Device is connected to the network of our Underlying Carrier or roaming and transmitting data, including, but not limited to: (a) sending, receiving, or downloading any type of content, including emails, documents, files, pictures, MMS messages, and any other content, (b) accessing websites, (c) downloading and using applications, (d) streaming content, or (e) requesting software updates. Data usage may also occur from normal operation of software used by the network and/or your device, including (i) for access, transport, and routing of data on the network of our Underlying Carrier, (ii) from partial or interrupted downloads and resend requests caused by network errors or when you cancel or attempt to cancel a transmission, and (iii) from unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications. Some applications, content, programs, and software that you download or that come pre-installed on your Device regularly send and receive data transmissions when your Device is powered on to function properly, without you affirmatively initiating transmissions. For example, applications that provide real-time information, location-based services, or synchronization with cloud services frequently or continually send and receive updated information so that it is available to you when you want to access it. In addition, any advertisements or advertiser-related messages or data delivered to your Device, even if delivered to an application, and any messages or content that are initiated in response to an advertisement, use data. Based on several factors (e.g., the specific application, network performance, etc.) data usage may vary widely, even for the same activity. Estimates of data usage (e.g., the size of downloadable files) will not necessarily be an accurate predictor of actual usage. To prevent unintended data usage, you should connect your device to third party-provided Wi-Fi when available and supported by your Device or power off your Device when it is not in use.

#### **4.WIRELESS DEVICES**

**4.1. Device Options**

Upon enrolling in Access Wireless’s service, you may be eligible to receive a free wireless Device from Access Wireless to use with the wireless Services, in which case, you can upgrade to higher grade device offered by Access Wireless for an additional cost, if available.

Access Wireless’s device unlocking policy is addressed in detail in Section 4.7 below. Access Wireless reserves the right to substitute or replace any Device provided by Access Wireless with another Access Wireless Device of comparable quality at any time. Devices provided by Access Wireless will be delivered to you in-person or to your home address. Access Wireless Devices may not be purchased in bulk or sold to third parties. If you provide your own Device, you are responsible for ensuring your Device is unlocked, compatible with and does not interfere with our Services or the network of our Underlying Carrier, and complies with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and standards. Additionally, your Device cannot be reported as lost or stolen or associated with fraudulent activity. You are responsible for the maintenance of your Device and the purchase and maintenance of any additional hardware or software necessary to use your Device with our Services. Not all Services are available with all Devices, on all networks, or at all times, and we do not guarantee the availability of all Services on all Devices.

**4.2.1. Warranty**

Access Wireless extends a manufacturer’s warranty on all Devices purchased directly from Access Wireless for 30 calendar days from the date of purchase. You must return the Device in defective condition. You may elect to exchange the Device for the model of your choice. Payment will be required at the new customer price for exchanges to more expensive models. You must surrender your Device to Access Wireless to qualify for this discount. Refunds are available for device downgrades. After 61+ days, the Warranty and defective phone policy does not apply. However, you can receive new customer pricing on the device model of your choice. Refunds will be available for exchanges to less expensive models. Lost, stolen, damaged or working Devices are not eligible for exchanges under this policy.

Access Wireless does not manufacture any Devices or equipment you may use with the Services, including Devices we may provide or sell to you. We are not liable for any defects, acts, or omissions of the manufacturers. Your Device’s manufacturer may provide you with a warranty directly or that we may pass through from the manufacturer to you. If your Device becomes defective after the standard 30-day return policy, you must contact the manufacturer for any warranty options.

For Devices purchased on [shop.accesswireless.com](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/shop.accesswireless.com), please see warranty information, available at [https://shop.accesswireless.com/RMA/](https://shop.accesswireless.com/RMA/).

**4.2.2. Loss, Theft, Damage, or Destruction**

Upon accepting a Device from us, all risk of loss, theft, damage, or destruction of your Device or its accessories, whether provided by us or by you, is borne by you. Access Wireless is not responsible for, nor will we issue refunds for any lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed phones or accessories. In the event your Device is lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed, you may purchase a replacement Device from Access Wireless at your own expense. If a Device provided by Access Wireless is lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed while in transit to you and before delivery, we may replace the Device in our sole discretion. 

When you activate a replacement Device, we will apply any remaining Allotments associated with your monthly Service Plan. If your Device is lost or stolen, you are responsible for any usage of your Allotments or charges incurred using your Device until you report the loss or theft to us by contacting Access Wireless Customer Service at 866-594-3644. Upon receiving notice of a lost or stolen Device, Access Wireless will take immediate steps to suspend the Services. If you do not activate a replacement Device or fail to notify Access Wireless that you have found a lost or stolen Device within thirty days (30) days, we may cancel your subscription to Access Wireless Services and reassign the number associated with your account to another user. If your Services are canceled or if you choose to terminate your Services following the loss, theft, damage, or destruction of your Device, we will not prorate charges to the date of the cancelation or termination, and you will not receive a credit or refund for any unused Allotments. You agree to cooperate and act in good faith and in a reasonable manner in connection with any investigation of the loss or theft of your Device (e.g., by providing facts, sworn statements, or other information that would help the investigation). Except as otherwise provided herein, if your Device is lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed, you remain responsible for complying with your other obligations under this Agreement including, but not limited to, payment of any charges.

**4.3. Software Updates**

Access Wireless may, from time-to-time remotely check, update or change your Device’s software, applications, or programming, including your Device’s electronic SIM card, without notice, to address security, safety, or other issues that may impact your service, our Underlying Carrier’s network, or your Device. These changes may result in the following: data use; modification of your Device; alteration or erasure of data stored on your Device; how you have programmed your Device; or how you are able to use your Device. Access Wireless is not responsible for lost data or functionality. While your Device is receiving a software update, whether by our action or yours, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software update is complete, including to contact 911 or other emergency services.

**4.4. Device Software, Content, and Applications**

Access Wireless may offer software, content, and applications, including but not limited to mobile device management technology, which you may choose to download from Access Wireless or third-party sources or that may come preinstalled on your Device. You have the option to disable those applications that come preinstalled on your Device. These may or may not be branded as Access Wireless software, content, and applications. These software, content, and applications are licensed, not sold, to you by Access Wireless and/or its licensors/suppliers for personal, lawful, non-commercial use solely in connection with your use of your Access Wireless Device with our Services. You may be subject to additional license terms between you and the third-party creator or owner of such software, content, and applications. You acknowledge that Access Wireless or its licensors/suppliers are the intended third-party beneficiaries of these licenses. Your use of these software, content, and applications must comply with their intended purposes, the license, this Agreement, and all applicable laws. You may only make such copies as is reasonably necessary for your personal non-commercial use. You may not (and you agree not to enable others to) otherwise copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, reproduce, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, defeat, or circumvent protective and other digital rights management mechanisms, combine, or create derivative works of the software, content, and applications or any portion thereof. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, transfer, sublicense, broadcast, or cause public performance of the software, content, and applications or any portion thereof. You agree the software, content, and applications contain proprietary information owned by Access Wireless, its licensors/suppliers, or the creator/owner. Access Wireless and its licensors/suppliers reserve the right to update, modify, delete, suspend or terminate access to, or impose limits on the use or access of the software, content, and applications at any time, without notice. Without limitation, the warranty disclaimer, limitation of liability, and indemnification provisions found in this Agreement apply to these software, content, and applications.

**4.5. Unauthorized Modifications**

Except as provided in Section 4.7, you are not permitted to unlock, re-flash, tamper with, or otherwise alter the hardware or software on your Access Wireless Device for any purpose. Your Access Wireless Device may have a software programming lock that protects certain of the handset’s operating parameters against unauthorized reprogramming.

**4.6. Device Unlocking Policy**

Subject to certain limitations, Access Wireless complies with the [CTIA Consumer Code](https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/industry-commitments/consumer-code-for-wireless-service) regarding the ability of our current and former subscribers and individual owners to request that we unlock eligible Access Wireless Devices that are locked by or at the direction of Access Wireless. Specifically, Access Wireless adheres to the following principles:

1\. **Disclosure.** Access Wireless has posted this clear, concise, and readily accessible policy regarding postpaid and prepaid mobile wireless Device unlocking on its website.  
2\. **Prepaid Unlocking Policy.** Access Wireless will, upon request, unlock prepaid Devices no later than one year after initial activation, for subscribers that are in full compliance with our Terms and Conditions.  
3\. **Unlocking Policy.** Access Wireless will, upon request, unlock Devices used to access Access Wireless’s services no later than one year after initial activation, for subscribers that are in full compliance with our Terms and Conditions.  
4\. **Notice.** Access Wireless will clearly notify customers that their Devices are eligible for unlocking at the time when their Devices are eligible for unlocking or automatically unlock Devices remotely when Devices are eligible for unlocking, without additional fee. Access Wireless reserves the right to charge non-customers/non-former customers with a reasonable fee for unlocking requests. Notice to prepaid customers may occur at point of sale, at the time of eligibility, or through a clear and concise statement of policy on the Access Wireless website.  
5\. **Response Time.** Access Wireless will, within two days of receiving an unlocking request, do one of the following: (i) unlock or provide information to facilitate the unlocking of an eligible phone; (ii) initiate a request to the original equipment manufacturer to unlock a Device; (iii) explain to the requesting customer why the phone is ineligible for unlocking; or (iv) offer a reasonable explanation as to why Access Wireless needs more time to process the unlocking request.  
6\. **Deployed Personnel Unlocking Policy.** For deployed military personnel who are in full compliance with the Access Wireless Terms and Conditions, we will unlock Devices upon receiving a valid copy of deployment papers.

“Unlocking” refers only to the disabling of software that prevents a Device from being used on another carrier’s network, even if that network is technologically compatible. It does not pertain to hardware changes and does not guarantee that an Access Wireless Device will be compatible with any particular carrier’s network or that all functionality of the Device can be enabled on any other network. Devices that work on the network of Access Wireless’s Underlying Carrier may not work with other carriers’ networks due to the use of different frequencies and technologies to provide wireless network access.

As a reseller of wireless service, Access Wireless’s unlocking policy may be subject to limitations imposed by its Underlying Carrier. Additionally, Access Wireless may deny a Device unlocking request if, in our sole discretion, we have a reasonable basis to believe that the request is an effort to defraud the company or its subscribers or that the Device is stolen. 

#### **5. CHARGES AND PAYMENTS**

**5.1. Charges, Fees, and Taxes**

You are responsible for paying all one-time and recurring charges that result from your commercial relationship with Access Wireless and from the use of our Services, whether accrued by you or by another person using your Device or Services, including, but not limited to: (i) one time or recurring Service Plan charges; (ii) Device purchase, upgrade, and replacement charges; (iii) activation, reconnection, prepayment, and other administrative or customer service charges or fees; (iv) returned and late payment charges or fees; (v) roaming, network, and other surcharges; (vi) optional feature charges, such as operator and directory assistance, toll and collect calls, voicemail, and call forwarding, if applicable; (vii) Top Up Plan charges; and (viii) all required or applicable federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges, fees, and any other regulatory or governmental assessments, whether assessed directly upon you or upon Access Wireless and billed to you for cost recovery. We do not assess early termination fees. Taxes, fees, and surcharges may vary depending on the billing address associated with your account and may vary from month-to-month based on our or the government’s calculations. We may, but are not obligated to, provide notice of such variances. Advertised rates may not include federal, state, and local taxes, fees, surcharges, and other assessments. With the exception of taxes or other charges that are required by law, no additional surcharges are assessed on Lifeline and/or ACP-supported services and charges and fees associated with Lifeline and/or ACP-supported Services are all inclusive and fully disclosed to Lifeline and/or ACP applicants and subscribers. All charges, fees, and taxes, once paid, are non-refundable.

**5.2. Billing and Payment**

You may contact Access Wireless at 1-866-594-3644 to request a copy of your monthly invoice.

You are responsible for reviewing your bills to ensure that all charges are accurate. Access Wireless bills will distinguish (a) charges collected and retained by the carrier, including charges for Service Plans, “Top up” Plans, and features, from (b) taxes, surcharges, fees, and any other regulatory or governmental assessments collected by us and remitted to federal, state, or local governments. Cost recovery fees and charges will not be labeled as taxes. You agree to pay for all prepaid charges immediately when billed and all postpaid charges on or before your payment due date or monthly expiration date using a credit or debit card or other valid payment method. You must promptly notify us of any change in your billing address or payment method. 

**By providing payment information and accepting this agreement, you authorize us or our payment service provider to charge your payment method in advance for prepaid payments to ensure that payments are received by any due date. You may cancel the automatic renewal of your Service Plan at any time. We will not, except in our sole discretion, refund, prorate, or credit any charges, fees, or taxes, including if you modify or terminate your service before or have remaining Allotments at the end of your monthly cycle.** If you wish to dispute a charge, you must do so in accordance with the dispute resolution process described in Section 10. 

**5.3. Creditworthiness**

Access Wireless does not condition the provision of Services on a subscriber’s credit rating, credit history, or other method of determining creditworthiness. Access Wireless does not provide subscriber payment history and other account billing and charge information to any credit reporting agency or industry clearinghouse. No deposits are held or required as a condition of receiving Services, nor do we have any preset account spending limits.

**5.4. Promotions and Rewards**

Access Wireless may, from time to time, provide you with promotional credits, promotional offers, or loyalty rewards (collectively, “Promotions and Rewards”). Promotions or Awards cannot be applied to any device co-pay required under the ACP. Promotional credits are typically courtesy account credits due to service issues, device issues, or customer inconveniences. Promotional offers are typically plan, device, and pricing offers that are available for a limited time or when you meet certain conditions. Loyalty rewards are typically rewards for being an Access Wireless customer. Promotions and Rewards are offered at the sole discretion of Access Wireless. Promotions and Rewards can only be claimed and redeemed by accountholders and only will be associated with the account of the customer who was offered the Promotions and Rewards. Promotions and Rewards may not be sold or transferred to another Access Wireless account or to any other person. Promotions and Rewards have no fixed or cash value or equivalent, and may not be exchanged, transferred, resold, redeemed, or substituted for cash, merchandise, or services. If your Access Wireless Services are terminated for any reason, any Promotions and Rewards offered to you or associated with your account are forfeited. If you fail to make payments on your account or otherwise violate this Agreement, you may lose the ability to claim or redeem Promotions and Rewards. Promotions and Rewards are not your property and Access Wireless may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, discontinue, suspend, revoke, cancel, or terminate them at any time, with or without notice. Promotions and Rewards may not be available to all subscribers, in all locations, or combinable with other Promotions and Rewards. Promotions and Rewards may be subject to additional terms and conditions as described to you when offered to you. 

**5.5. Third-Party Purchases**

Devices associated with your Services may be used to purchase content, information, applications, and other goods and services from third parties, including in-app purchases (collectively, “Third-Party Purchases”). You are responsible for all charges resulting from Third-Party Purchases and are presumed to have provided the consent and representations required for those purchases regardless of whether the purchases were made by you or someone using a Device associated with your account, including consent for the use and disclosure of your account information to provision and bill for the purchases, consent to use location information to deliver the purchases to the Device, and representations of age for the person using the Device when a purchase is made. If you cancel or attempt to cancel a download or purchase that is in progress, or if a download or purchase is otherwise interrupted through no action on your part, you may nevertheless be charged in accordance with the terms and conditions associated with the purchase. Access Wireless will not be liable for any such charges. If you believe your Services were used fraudulently to make purchases, you must notify us immediately and provide us with such documentation and information as we may request (including affidavits and police reports) as evidence of the fraudulent use. After you notify us, we will attempt to help you prevent the fraud by terminating existing Services if possible and practicable, but you will remain responsible for all charges. You agree to cooperate with us in any fraud investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe. Failure to provide reasonable cooperation may result in your liability for all fraudulent usage and charges. Access Wireless makes no representations or warranties (expressed or implied), to the fullest extent permitted by law, including for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, of Third-Party Purchases nor are we responsible for proper download, installation, functionality, or security of Third-Party Purchases.

#### **6. SERVICE FEATURES, LIMITATIONS, AND NOTICES**

**6.1. Account Access**

You can access your subscriber account information by contacting Access Wireless Customer Service and providing necessary authentication information. You will only be able to access Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”), as defined by the FCC, see 47 CFR § 64.2003, by providing a password associated with your account. If you are not able to provide a password, Access Wireless can only disclose your CPNI by sending it to your address of record or by calling you at your telephone number of record. We may, but are not obligated to, allow you to authorize other individuals to access your account. If you authorize another person to access your account or provide such person with your authentication information, those individuals may be permitted to make changes to your account. You authorize us to provide information about and make changes to your account, including changes to your Service Plan and features, upon the direction of any person able to provide your authentication information. Those changes will be binding on you and Access Wireless takes no responsibility for those changes. To protect the security of your CPNI, your password should be unique and complex. You should not provide your account authentication information, including your password, to third parties, and such information should be stored safely to prevent third-party access. If you believe your account authentication information was disclosed or accessed by an unauthorized person, we advise you to change the information immediately.

**6.2. Account Protection Measures**

You should be aware of two fraudulent practices – Port-Out Fraud and SIM Swap Fraud– that could enable threat actors to take control of your account without gaining physical control of your device.

**Port-Out Fraud**. Port-Out Fraud involves the threat actor opening an account with a wireless provider on your behalf and arranging for your phone number to be ported out (transferred) to the new account.

**SIM Swap Fraud**. Your device has a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, including a chip that identifies your phone number with that phone. SIM Swap Fraud happens when a threat actor convinces Access Wireless to transfer your service from your device to the threat actor’s device. 

Access Wireless has implemented a number of measures to help you protect your account against Port-Out Fraud and SIM Swap Fraud.

**6.2.1. Customer Notification of Port-Out and SIM Change Requests**

**6.2.1.1. Port-Out Requests**  
Upon receiving a port-out request, and before effectuating the request, Access Wireless shall provide you immediate notification that a port-out request associated with your account was made, except if the port-out request was made in connection with a legitimate line separation request pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 345 and Part 64, Subpart II of this chapter, regardless of whether the line separation is technically or operationally feasible.

**6.2.1.2. SIM Change Requests**  
Upon receiving a SIM change request, and before effectuating the request, Access Wireless shall provide immediate notification you that a SIM change request associated with your account was made, except if the SIM change request was made in connection with a legitimate line separation request pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 345 and Part 64, Subpart II of this chapter, regardless of whether the line separation is technically or operationally feasible.

**6.2.2. Account Locks to Prevent Porting and SIM Change**

**6.2.2.1. Port Locks**

**6.2.2.1.1. Your Options to Activate and Deactivate Port Locks**

Access Wireless will promptly investigate and take reasonable steps within our control to remediate fraudulent number ports and fraudulent SIM changes.

Upon request, Access Wireless will provide you with documentation of fraudulent number ports or fraudulent SIM changes.

**6.3. International Calling and Messaging**

Access Wireless’s wireless talk allotments can only be used for domestic calls. At this time, international calls are not included with our Service Plans or “Top up” Plans. Access Wireless’s wireless text allotments can be used for domestic and international text messages.

**6.4. Wireless Coverage**

The availability of Access Wireless’s wireless Services is subject to the geographic coverage area of our Underlying Carrier and its roaming partners. Only domestic U.S. coverage is available; we do not offer international coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere in the domestic U.S., and you will not have access to our Services outside the coverage area. A coverage map reflecting the approximate geographic coverage area of our Underlying Carrier and its roaming partners can be accessed from our website, at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/coverage](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/coverage). Areas without coverage are shown as gaps. Coverage maps are generated using generally accepted methodologies and standards but are only approximations of actual coverage. There may be locations within the estimated coverage area where actual coverage is limited and you may experience interruptions or reductions in Service quality, including due to interference from buildings and other structures, terrain, and foliage. Additionally, actual coverage at any given time may vary by Service and be affected by factors beyond our control, as described in Section 6.4. Coverage maps and any statements by us, our agents, or dealers about coverage are only intended to provide high-level estimates of our coverage area when you are using our Services outdoors under optimal conditions and do not mean that service will be available under all circumstances, at all times, or without interruption. **Access Wireless does not guarantee or warrant the coverage of the network of our Underlying Carrier or its roaming partners. Where there is no coverage, 911 calls may not reach public safety answering points. In such instances, subscribers should dial 911 from the nearest landline phone.** Coverage maps may be updated periodically and without notice to reflect the current operations of our Underlying Carrier and its roaming partners.

**6.5. Service Availability and Quality**

In addition to factors that affect coverage, Service availability and quality may be subject to “Service Limitations,” which may depend on whether you are using wireless or landline Services. These include interruptions, delays, or reductions, due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: weather and atmospheric conditions; obstructions; electromagnetic interference; use of the Services inside a building or moving vehicle; your geographic location relative to our coverage area; your proximity to wireless cell sites; the capacity of a cell site; the number of other customers connected to the same cell site; other network capacity limitations and congestion; the capabilities and compatibility of your device; network outages or issues on the network of our Underlying Carrier or interconnecting carriers; and priority access by National Security and Emergency Preparedness personnel in the event of a disaster or emergency. Additional factors that may affect our Services are described in our Broadband Transparency Policy, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/open-internet-transparency-statement](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/open-internet-transparency-statement). Once identified, Access Wireless takes reasonable steps to attempt to remedy Service Limitations that are within its control. Service Limitations may also occur as a result of network maintenance, including equipment modifications, upgrades, relocations, repairs, or similar activities necessary or proper for network operation or improvement imposed by Access Wireless, its Underlying Carrier, or interconnecting carries. Access Wireless will use reasonable efforts to notify you prior to the performance of such maintenance and will attempt to schedule its maintenance during non-peak hours. Service Limitations may result in dropped or blocked calls, inability to make or receive calls, inability to send or receive text messages, or inability to access the Internet and other data services. You acknowledge that the Services are provided through the nationwide wireless network of the underlying carrier of our choosing and may be subject to the service availability and quality of our Underlying Carrier. **We do not guarantee or warrant the availability or quality of the Services at any given time or geographic location, we are not liable for Service Limitations, and you are not guaranteed compensation or reimbursement for Service Limitations.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your Services experiences Service Limitations for 24 or more continuous hours by a cause within our control, and you notify Access Wireless at 866-594-3644 within seven (7) days of the Service Issue, we may, in our sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis, issue you a credit.

**6.6. Service Security and Optimization**

Access Wireless or our Underlying Carrier may, but are not obligated to, take any action we deem necessary to: (1) address security threats and otherwise protect the networks, Services, systems, and equipment from harm or degradation; (2) optimize, improve, or manage the networks, Services, systems, and equipment; (3) preserve and protect their rights and interests and those of their subscribers and third parties; and (4) otherwise ensure the activities of some users do not impair the ability of Access Wireless or our Underlying Carrier to provide their subscribers with access to reliable Services provided at reasonable costs. Such actions may include, but are not limited to:

1. discontinuing, blocking, or terminating certain categories of Services;
2. restricting, reducing, or limiting the amount of usage of the Services;
3. limiting data throughput speeds or quantities;
4. reducing the size of data transfers;
5. limiting, disabling, or preventing access to particular features;
6. blocking, limiting, or disconnecting access to individual phone numbers or certain categories of phone numbers (e.g., 976, 900), countries, destinations, or providers;
7. limiting the provision of Services at certain times or in certain areas, including due to changes in coverage of our Underlying Carrier or changes in roaming agreements;
8. filtering or blocking certain calls, texts, and data transmissions sent through the network, including spam, unlawful and unwanted telemarketing calls and messages, and malware (we do not guarantee that you will not receive and we are not liable for such calls, text, or transmissions; if you are receiving unwanted telemarketing messages, contact the source and unsubscribe or remove your mobile phone number from the service);
9. blocking calls to you at your request or to other called parties at their request;
10. blocking or otherwise preventing access to third party services or other premium services, features, or content that would generate additional fees or charges billed to Access Wireless, either directly or through your account as a result of your use of or access to the service, feature, or content;
11. blocking hacking and other attempts for unauthorized access; and
12. blocking or terminating usage that is indicative of uses prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy (Section 7), including uses that result in abnormally long calls, high costs, or high usage.

Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications and usage, including by resulting in dropped or blocked calls, inability to make or receive calls, inability to send or receive text messages, or inability to access the Internet and other data services. For additional information about our network security practices for our data Service, please review our Broadband Transparency Policy at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/open-internet-transparency-statement](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/open-internet-transparency-statement).

**6.7. Wireless Device Location Information**

Your wireless Device may be location enabled, which means the location of your Device can be determined by using Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), wireless network location information, or other location technology when your device is turned on. Your location information may be used by us, our Underlying Carrier, or third-party services, as described in our Privacy Policy, available at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy). Additionally, your location information may be used by 911 and other emergency services, as described in Section 6.7. Your location information may be unavailable if your Device is unable to acquire satellite signals and network coverage, which may prevent you, us, and other services from accessing your location. Satellite signals and network coverage may be unavailable due to a variety of factors beyond our control, as described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4. We do not warrant or guarantee that location-based services will be available at any specific time or geographic location. You may be able to configure the settings on your Device or in third-party services to restrict or disable the sharing of your location information. It is your responsibility to notify individuals who may use your Device that it may be location enabled. 

**6.8. 911 and Other Emergency Services**

Your Device’s location information may be used to assist emergency services in finding you, but you should always be prepared to provide both your location information and phone number when contacting 911 or other emergency services. Wireless devices may not always be able to provide 911 dispatchers with your exact location or other information when you make an emergency call. Even when location information is transmitted from your wireless Device to a dispatcher, the information may not be accurate. If you attempt to make an emergency call from your wireless Device in an area where there is no wireless coverage, your call may not go through, in which case, you should try calling again from the nearest landline phone. **Access Wireless does not guarantee that your location information will be transmitted to emergency dispatchers or that any location information that is transmitted will be accurate. Nor does Access Wireless guarantee that you will be able to contact emergency services in areas where there is limited or no wireless coverage.**

**6.9. Third-Party Content and Applications**

Devices may be used to access and disseminate third-party content and applications through the Services. Some content and applications may: (i) harm your Device or its software; (ii) infringe on the rights of others; (iii) be unreliable, inaccurate, or incomplete; (iv) be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; or (v) be unsuitable for minors. When you access, download, install, or use third-party content and applications, you may voluntarily or involuntarily provide information to third-party content and applications providers. You are solely responsible for evaluating the third-party content and applications accessed while using the Device and Services. By allowing a minor to use the Device and Services, you are consenting to the minor being able to access any third-party content and applications available through the Services and provide information to the third-party content and application providers; we strongly recommend that you monitor the third-party content and applications accessed by minors using the Device and Services. Access Wireless does not control and is not responsible for the third-party content and applications accessed or disseminated using the Device or Services. We may, but do not have the obligation to, monitor, review, and restrict or refuse to transmit certain third-party content and applications. **Access Wireless is not a publisher of third-party content and applications.** When you access, download, install, or use third-party content and applications, you are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third-party content and applications. You may review our Privacy Policy, at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy), to learn how you may provide information to third-party content and applications. For assistance with third-party content and applications, contact the third-party developers or owners directly.

**6.10. Phone Numbers and Porting**

You must accept the phone number we assign to you at the time you subscribe to Access Wireless’s Services. We reserve the right to change your mobile phone number at any time, but we will attempt to notify you prior to any such change. You can switch your number to another Access Wireless Device at no additional charge. Except for any legal right you may have to transfer (“port”) your phone number to or from another carrier, you have no and cannot gain any proprietary ownership or other rights to any phone number we assign to you, your Device, or your account. We do not guarantee that numbers ported to or from Access Wireless will be successful. To request to port a phone number to or from Access Wireless, please contact Access Wireless Customer Service by dialing 611 from your Access Wireless Device or calling toll-free at 866-594-3644. Before you call to port a number to Access Wireless, please have a bill from your existing wireless or wireline provider available. When you port a number to Access Wireless from another carrier, you are solely responsible for all charges billed or incurred prior to deactivation of service with your prior carrier and for any applicable early termination fees assessed by your prior carrier; Access Wireless will not reimburse you for these charges. Due to compatibility issues, you may be required to purchase or obtain a new device to use our Services after you port a number to Access Wireless, and you may be without Services until the new device is configured. If you authorize another carrier to port a number from Access Wireless, we will consider that a request by you to terminate all of your Services with us that are associated with that number and the termination will occur on the date the number is ported. Notwithstanding our honoring port requests, any balance due will still be owed by you to us. If your Services are terminated for any reason and you do not port your number to another provider, we may reassign the phone number you were using to another subscriber without notice. You will not be able to transfer any unused talk, text, or data allotments on your Access Wireless account to your new provider and after the porting is completed, you will no longer be able to use our Services with that number. Under no circumstance will we refund you for any Allotments or account payments if you port out your number. If you port your phone number to or from Access Wireless, some Services, such as 911 location services, may not be immediately available through Access Wireless or the other carrier while the port is being processed.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, release, indemnify, and hold harmless Access Wireless and parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and their past, present, and future officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, licensors, successors, and assigns from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, injuries, costs, penalties, damages, settlements, and expenses (including taxes, fees, fines, penalties, interest, expenses, and attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to, directly or indirectly, your or any other person’s use of a Device or the Services, whether based in contract or tort (including strict liability) and regardless of the form of action; your acts or omissions, including your breach or violation of this Agreement, other Access Wireless policies, or any applicable statutes, ordinances, laws or regulations of any federal, state, or local authority; and claims arising in whole or in part from the alleged negligence of Access Wireless. If we reasonably determine that a claim might adversely affect Access Wireless, you will use counsel reasonably satisfactory to us to defend each claim, you will not consent to the entry of a judgment or settle a claim without our prior written consent, and we may take control of the defense at our expense (and without limiting your indemnification obligations). This obligation shall survive termination of your Services with Access Wireless.

#### **10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION**

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

Most subscriber concerns can be resolved quickly and to the subscriber’s satisfaction by contacting Access Wireless Customer Support by dialing 611 from your Access Wireless Device or calling toll-free at 866-594-3644. In the unlikely event that the Customer Support is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if Access Wireless has not been able to resolve a Dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), **those Disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration or small claims court as described in this section.**

**10.1. Arbitration Agreement**

**WE (you and Access Wireless) EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.**

This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as Access Wireless’s suppliers, Dealers, or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. We each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 10.4). 

THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES).

If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or Access Wireless may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Access Wireless’s registered agent (see Section 10.5) to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, Access Wireless will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, Access Wireless agrees not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.

**10.2. CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

**WE (YOU AND Access Wireless) EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, then the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.**

**10.3. Small Claims** 

You and Access Wireless retain the right to seek remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within that court's jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator's award. This Arbitration Provision shall survive any termination, payoff or transfer of this contract. If any part of this Arbitration Provision, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable. If a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision shall be unenforceable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you maintain your right to file a complaint with the FCC, your state’s Public Service Commission, or any other federal or state government that may, if permitted by law, seek relief against us on your behalf.

**10.4. Governing Law, Venue and Jurisdiction, and Court Proceedings**

Except to the extent preempted by or inconsistent with applicable federal law and as otherwise described herein, this agreement is governed by the laws of North Carolina, without regard to choice of law principles, conflicts of laws rules, or your actual state of residence. For any claim that proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial and any claims for punitive or exemplary damages. Unless otherwise specified herein, any Disputes of a legal nature, whether a claim, complaint, arbitration demand, or otherwise that is not subject to the mandatory arbitration provision, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located within the state of North Carolina.

**11.1. Application of Tariffs**

Access Wireless may elect or be required to file informational tariffs with the appropriate regulatory body in certain states describing our terms and rates for our delivery of certain Services. To the extent that any provision of a tariff is inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement, the terms of the Agreement shall apply and the terms of the tariff shall not apply.

**11.2. Consent to Receive Communications**

Access Wireless may occasionally need to communicate with you about your Services. We may do so without your consent in certain instances, for example in emergency situations or for service-related communications where you are not charged for the message. In addition, you have a right, and we have a duty, under federal law, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI. You hereby provide consent for us or our authorized agents or representatives to use your CPNI to market communications-related services to you. You may restrict our right to use CPNI for marketing purposes at any time. Denial of approval will not affect the provision of the services we provide to you. Any approval, or denial of approval for the use of CPNI outside of the service to which you already subscribe is valid until you affirmatively revoke or limit such approval or denial.

Further, you provide consent for Access Wireless or our authorized agents or representatives to contact you using live, automated, or prerecorded messages (including artificial voice technologies) to any landline, wireless, or facsimile telephone number, including via text messages to your phone. We may contact you for service-related, informational or marketing purposes via these methods. You also provide consent to contact you, regardless of whether your number is listed on the Do-Not-Call Registry or a state equivalent registry. Consent to such contacts is not a condition of service and may be revoked at any time. 

Finally, you provide consent for us to contact you for any reason, including for marketing purposes via the email address we assign you or you provide in connection with your service. 

You agree that we also have the consent to contact any authorized user on your account for Service or payment-related reasons via any of the methods described above. Some of these communications may result in charges to you. Your consent to be contacted via any of the methods described above may be revoked at any time by any reasonable means. Please review our Privacy Policy, at [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/privacy-policy), for additional information about how you may revoke consent to receive communications.

**11.3. Modifications to this Agreement**

We may, at any time, modify any part of this Agreement; any other terms, conditions, and policies; our rates, fees, and charges; our Service Plans, features, and products; and our coverage areas, Underlying Carrier, and provisioning technology. We will provide you with advanced notice of any modifications that have a material adverse impact on you or your use of the Services (other than changes to governmental fees, proportional charges for governmental mandates, and administrative charges). We may provide you with notice of any other modifications, as described in Section 11.4 (Notices) or as otherwise required by any applicable law, regulation, or order. If any regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction, issues a law, regulation, rule, or order that has the effect of materially increasing the cost to provide the Services or canceling, changing, or superseding any material term or provision of this Agreement (collectively “Regulatory Requirement”), then this Agreement shall be deemed modified in such a way as is consistent with the form, intent, and purpose of the Regulatory Requirement and otherwise as is necessary to comply with the Regulatory Requirement. Material adverse modifications become effective thirty (30) days after we deliver notice to you or as otherwise specified in the notice. All other modifications become effective when posted on the Access Wireless website, [https://www.accesswireless.com/support/terms-and-conditions](https://www.accesswireless.com/support/terms-and-conditions), or as specified in any notice. If you continue to access, use, or purchase Access Wireless Services on or after the effective date of such modifications, you accept those modifications. Neither the course of conduct between you and Access Wireless nor common trade practice will act to modify any provision of this agreement.

**11.4. Notices**

We or our authorized agents may use any of the following methods to provide you with notices: correspondence to any physical address or e-mail addresses you have provided us; live or prerecorded calls, voice messages, or text messages delivered to your Device or any other phone number you have provided us; prerecorded messages when you attempt to place a call; in-app messages or push notifications; posting on our website; or by any other means Access Wireless deems practicable. You are responsible for updating your contact information with us when it changes. Notices are treated as delivered when you accept a call; when delivered to a voicemail service associated with your service or an alternate telephone number you have provided to us, text messaging service, email address you have provided to us, or Device; when posted on our website or in an application; and three (3) days after mailed to your last known billing address. Except as otherwise provided in this agreement, you must provide us notice by calling or sending correspondence to us using the contact information provided in Section 12.

**11.5. No Third-Party Beneficiaries**

This Agreement is solely for the benefit of you, Access Wireless, and our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest.

**11.6. Assignment**

You may not transfer or assign this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations under it, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may transfer or assign all or part of this Agreement, or your debts to us, without notice.

**11.7. Force Majeure**

**11.8. Enforcement and Waiver**

Access Wireless has the right, but not the obligation to, monitor, investigate, restrict, enforce, bring civil litigation, press charges, or engage in any other self-help regarding any actual, attempted, or suspected violation of this Agreement.

If we determine or suspect that you violated or attempted to violate this Agreement, we may terminate, suspend, modify, or limit your Services, as described in Section 8. Additionally, we may report actual or suspected criminal offences to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Access Wireless will cooperate with law enforcement investigations where criminal activity is suspected, and you agree to cooperate with any such investigations. Any waiver of or failure to enforce any provision or prohibition in this Agreement in one instance shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right in another instance.

Access Wireless is a service provider for the government-funded Lifeline Assistance program. Lifeline service is provided by i-wireless LLC, d/b/a Access Wireless, an eligible telecommunications carrier. Lifeline service is non-transferable. Only one Lifeline discount, consisting of either wireline or wireless service, can be received per household. A household is defined, for the purposes of the Lifeline program, as any individual or group of individuals who live together at the same address and share income and expenses. Violation of the one-per-household rule constitutes a violation of FCC rules and will result in the customer’s de-enrollment from the Lifeline program. Consumers who willfully make false statements in order to obtain a Lifeline benefit can be punished by fine or imprisonment or can be barred from the program. Customers must present proper documentation confirming their eligibility for the Lifeline program. Customer information will be validated against public records and any discrepancies could result in your approval or rejection of service.
