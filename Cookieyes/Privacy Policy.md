2\. **Purpose**
---------------

1. The Processor has agreed to provide the Services to the Controller in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. In providing the Services, the Processor shall process Customer Data on behalf of the Controller. Customer Data may include Personal Data. The Processor will process and protect such Personal Data in accordance with the terms of this DPA.

3\. **Scope**
-------------

1. In providing the Services to the Controller pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Processor  shall process Personal Data only to the extent necessary to provide the Services in accordance with the  terms of the Agreement, this DPA and the Controller’s instructions documented in the Agreement and  this DPA, as may be updated from time to time. 
2. The Controller and Processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under  the authority of the Controller or the Processor who has access to Personal Data does not process them  except on the instructions from the Controller unless he or she is required to do so by any Data  Protection Law.  

4\. **Processor Obligations**
-----------------------------

1. The Processor may collect, process or use Personal Data only within the scope of this DPA.
2. The Processor confirms that it shall process Personal Data on behalf of the Controller in  accordance with the documented instructions of the Controller. 
3. The Processor shall promptly inform the Controller, if in the Processor’s opinion, any of the  instructions regarding the processing of Personal Data provided by the Controller, breach any Data  Protection Law.
4. The Processor shall ensure that all employees, agents, officers and contractors involved in the  handling of Personal Data: (i) are aware of the confidential nature of the Personal Data and are  contractually bound to keep the Personal Data confidential; (ii) have received appropriate training on  their responsibilities as a data processor; and (iii) are bound by the terms of this DPA. 
5. The Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational procedures to protect  Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature,  scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the  rights and freedoms of natural persons.  
6. The Processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a  level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: (i) the pseudonymisation and  encryption of Personal Data; (ii) the ability to ensure the on-going confidentiality, integrity, availability  and resilience of processing systems and services; (iii) the ability to restore the availability and access  to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; (iv) a process for  regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures  for ensuring the security of the processing. In accessing the appropriate level of security, account shall  be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Personal Data transmitted,  stored or otherwise processed. 
7. The technical and organisational measures detailed in Exhibit B shall at all times be adhered to  as a minimum security standard. The Controller accepts and agrees that the technical and organisational  measures are subject to development and review and that the Processor may use alternative suitable  measures to those detailed in the attachments to this DPA, provided such measures are at least  equivalent to the technical and organisational measures set out in Exhibit B and appropriate pursuant  to the Processor’s obligations in clauses 4.5 and 4.6 above. 
8. The Controller acknowledges and agrees that, in the course of providing the Services to the  Controller, it may be necessary for the Processor to access the Personal Data to respond to any  technical problems or Controller queries and to ensure the proper working of the Services. All such  access by the Processor will be limited to those purposes.  
9. Taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the Processor,  the Processor shall assist the Controller by having in place appropriate technical and organisational  measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Controller’s obligation to respond to  requests for exercising the Data Subject’s rights and the Controller’s compliance with the Controller’s  data protection obligations in respect of the processing of Personal Data. 
10. The Processor may not: (i) sell Personal Data; (ii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for  commercial purposes other than providing the Services under the terms of the Agreement; or (iii) retain,  use, or disclose Personal Data outside of the Agreement. 

5\. **Controller Obligations**
------------------------------

1. The Controller represents and warrants that: (i) it shall comply with this DPA and its obligations  under Data Protection Law; (ii) it has obtained any, and all, necessary permissions and authorisations  necessary to permit the Processor, its Affiliates and Sub-Processors, to execute their rights or perform  their obligations under this DPA; and (iii) all Affiliates of the Controller who use the Services shall comply  with the obligations of the Controller set out in this DPA.  
2. The Controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational procedures to protect  Personal Data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature,  scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the  rights and freedoms of natural persons. The Controller shall implement appropriate technical and  organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as  appropriate: (i) the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data; (ii) the ability to ensure the on going confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services; (iii) the  ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical  or technical incident; (iv) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of  technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. In accessing the  appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by  processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure  of, or access to Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. 
3. The Controller acknowledges and agrees that some instructions from the Controller, including  destruction or return of data, the Processor assisting with audits, inspections, DPIAs or providing any  assistance under this DPA, may result in additional fees. The Processor shall be entitled to charge the  Controller for its reasonable costs and expenses in providing any such assistance.

6\. **Sub-Processors**

1. The Controller acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Affiliates of the Processor may be used as  Sub-Processors; and (ii) the Processor and its Affiliates respectively may engage Sub-Processors in  connection with the provision of the Services.  
2. All Sub-Processors who process Personal Data in the provision of the Services to the Controller  shall comply with the obligations of the Processor set out in this DPA. 
3. The Controller authorises the Processor to use the Sub-Processors included in the List of Sub Processors to process the Personal Data. During the term of this DPA, the Processor shall provide the  Controller with 30 days prior notification, via email, of any changes to the List of Sub-Processors before  authorising any new or replacement Sub-Processor to process Personal Data in connection with  provision of the Services.  
4. The Controller may object to the use of a new or replacement Sub-Processor, by notifying the  Processor promptly in writing within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Processor’s notice. If the  Controller objects to a new or replacement Sub-Processor, the Controller may terminate the Agreement  with respect to those Services which cannot be provided by the Processor without the use of the new or  replacement Sub-Processor. The Processor will refund the Controller any prepaid fees covering the  remainder of the term of the Agreement following the effective date of termination with respect to such  terminated Services.  
5. All Sub-Processors who process Personal Data shall comply with the obligations of the  Processor set out in this DPA.

7\. **Restricted Transfers**
----------------------------

1. The parties agree that, when the transfer of Personal Data from the Controller to the Processor  or from the Processor to a Sub-Processor is a Restricted Transfer, it shall be subject to the applicable  SCCs. 
2. The parties agree that the EU SCCs shall apply to Restricted Transfers from the EEA. The EU  SCCs shall be deemed entered into (and incorporated into this DPA by reference) and completed as  follows: (i) Module Two (Controller to Processor) shall apply where the Customer is a Controller of  Customer Data and the Company is processing Customer Data; (ii) Module Three (Processor to Processor) shall apply where the Company is a Processor of  Customer Data and the Company uses a Sub-Processor to process the Customer Data; (iii) In Clause 7 of the EU SCCs, the optional docking clause will not apply; (iv) In Clause 9 of the EU SCCs Option 2 applies, and the time period for giving notice of Sub Processor changes shall be as set out in clause 6.3 of this DPA; (v) In Clause 11 of the EU SCCs, the optional language shall not apply; (vi) In Clause 17 of the EU SCCs, Option 1 applies and the EU SCCs shall be governed by Irish  law; (vii) In Clause 18(b) of the EU SCCs, disputes shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland; (viii) Annex I of the EU SCCs shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Exhibit A of  this DPA; (ix) Annex II of the EU SCCs shall be deemed completed with the information set out in Exhibit B of  this DPA.

4. The parties agree that the UK SCCs shall apply to Restricted Transfers from the UK and the UK  SCCs shall be deemed entered into (and incorporated into this DPA by reference), as set out in Exhibit  C of this DPA. 
5. In the event that any provision of this DPA contradicts directly or indirectly any SCCs, the  provisions of the applicable SCCs shall prevail over the terms of the DPA.

8\. **Data Subject Access Requests**
------------------------------------

1. The Controller may require correction, deletion, blocking and/or making available the Personal  Data during or after termination of the Agreement. The Controller acknowledges and agrees that the  Processor will process the request to the extent it is lawful and will reasonably fulfil such request in  accordance with its standard operational procedures to the extent possible. 
2. In the event that the Processor receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to Personal  Data, the Processor will refer the Data Subject to the Controller unless otherwise prohibited by law. The  Controller shall reimburse the Processor for all costs incurred resulting from providing reasonable  assistance in dealing with a Data Subject request. In the event that the Processor is legally required to  respond to the Data Subject, the Controller will fully cooperate with the Processor as applicable.

9\. **Audit**
-------------

1. The Processor shall make available to the Controller all information reasonably necessary to  demonstrate compliance with its processing obligations and allow for and contribute to audits and  inspections.  
2. Any audit conducted under this DPA shall consist of examination of the most recent reports,  certificates and/or extracts prepared by an independent auditor bound by confidentiality provisions  similar to those set out in the Agreement. In the event that provision of the same is not deemed sufficient  in the reasonable opinion of the Controller, the Controller may conduct a more extensive audit which will  be: (i) at the Controller’s expense; (ii) limited in scope to matters specific to the Controller and agreed in  advance; (iii) carried out during the Processor’s usual business hours and upon reasonable notice which  shall be not less than 4 weeks unless an identifiable material issue has arisen; and (iv) conducted in a  way which does not interfere with the Processor’s day-to-day business.  
3. This clause shall not modify or limit the rights of audit of the Controller, instead it is intended to  clarify the procedures in respect of any audit undertaken pursuant thereto.

10\. Personal **Data Breach**
-----------------------------

2. The Processor may make copies of and/or retain Personal Data in compliance with any legal or  regulatory requirement including, but not limited to, retention requirements. 
3. The Processor shall reasonably assist the Controller in meeting the Controller’s obligation to  carry out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), taking into account the nature of the processing  and the information available to the Processor. 
4. The Controller shall notify the Processor within a reasonable time, of any changes to applicable  data protection laws, codes or regulations which may affect the contractual duties of the Processor. The  Processor shall respond within a reasonable timeframe in respect of any changes that need to be made  to the terms of this DPA or to the technical and organisational measures to maintain compliance. If the  Processor is unable to accommodate necessary changes, the Controller may terminate the part or parts  of the Services which give rise to the non-compliance. To the extent that other parts of the Services  provided are not affected by such changes, the provision of those Services shall remain unaffected. 
5. The Controller and the Processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate,  on request, with a supervisory data protection authority in the performance of their respective obligations  under this DPA and Data Protection Law. 

12\. **Liability**
------------------

1. The limitations on liability set out in the Agreement apply to all claims made pursuant to any  breach of the terms of this DPA.  
2. The parties agree that the Processor shall be liable for any breaches of this DPA caused by the  acts and omissions or negligence of its Sub-Processors to the same extent the Processor would be  liable if performing the services of each Sub-Processor directly under the terms of the DPA, subject to  any limitations on liability set out in the terms of the Agreement. 
3. The parties agree that the Controller shall be liable for any breaches of this DPA caused by the  acts and omissions or negligence of its Affiliates as if such acts, omissions or negligence had been  committed by the Controller itself. 
4. The Controller shall not be entitled to recover more than once in respect of the same loss.

13\. **Term and Termination**
-----------------------------

1. The Processor will only process Personal Data for the term of the DPA. The term of this DPA  shall coincide with the commencement of the Agreement and this DPA shall terminate automatically  together with termination or expiry of the Agreement. 

14\. **Deletion and Return of Personal Data**
---------------------------------------------

1. The Processor shall at the choice of the Controller, upon receipt of a written request received  within 30 days of the end of the provision of the Services, delete or return Personal Data to the Controller.  The Processor shall in any event delete all copies of Personal Data in its systems within 60 days of the  effective date of termination of the Agreement unless: (i) applicable law or regulations require storage  of the Personal Data after termination; or (ii) partial Personal Data of the Controller is stored in backups,  then such Personal Data shall be deleted from backups up to 1 year after the effective date of termination  of the Agreement. 

15\. **General**
----------------

1. This DPA sets out the entire understanding of the parties with regards to the subject matter  herein. 
2. Should a provision of this DPA be invalid or become invalid then the legal effect of the other  provisions shall be unaffected. A valid provision is deemed to have been agreed which comes closest  to what the parties intended commercially and shall replace the invalid provision. The same shall apply  to any omissions. 
3. Subject to any provision of the SCCs to the contrary, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of  England and Wales. The courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction for the settlement of all  disputes arising under this DPA.

### ****Technical and Organisational Security Measures****

### ****(including Technical and Organisational Measures to Ensure the Security of Data)**** 

Below is a description of the technical and organisational measures implemented by the Processor  (including any relevant certifications) to ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the  nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, and the risks for the rights and freedoms of natural  persons. 

Where applicable this Exhibit B will serve as Annex II to the SCCs.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Measure** | **Description** |
| Measures of pseudonymisation and  encryption of Personal Data | The Controller’s data is encrypted at rest using AES256 bit  encryption Data in transit is protected by Transport Layer Security (“TLS”). |
| Measures for ensuring ongoing  confidentiality, integrity, availability  and resilience of processing  systems and services | Access to data necessary for the performance of the particular  task is ensured within the systems and applications by a  corresponding role and authorisation concept. In accordance to  the “least privilege” and “need-to-know” principles, each role has  only those rights which are necessary for the fulfilment of the task  to be performed by the individual person. To maintain data access control, state of the art encryption  technology is applied to the Personal Data itself where deemed  appropriate to protect sensitive data based on risk. |
| Measures for ensuring the ability to  restore the availability and access to  Personal Data in a timely manner in  the event of a physical or technical  incident | The Processor maintains redundancy throughout its IT  infrastructure in order to minimize the lack of availability to or loss  of data. Backups are maintained hourly and daily in accordance  with our backup procedures. |
| Processes for regularly testing,  assessing and evaluating the  effectiveness of technical and  organisational measures in order to  ensure the security of the  processing | The Processor uses multiple types of automated vulnerability  scans and assessments which are run at various frequencies (e.g.  when code changes occur, daily, weekly, and monthly).  Additionally, we perform annual third-party penetration tests and  industry security audits |
| Measures for user identification and  authorisation | The Processor uses logical access controls designed to manage  electronic access to data and system functionality based on  authority levels and job functions (e.g., use of unique IDs and |
|     | passwords for all users, periodic review and revoking/changing  access promptly when employment terminates). |
| Measures for the protection of data  during transmission | Data in transit is protected by Transport Layer Security (“TLS”). |
| Measures for the protection of data  during storage | Personal Data is only retained internally, and on the third party data centre servers, which are covered by AWS certifications.  The Controller’s archived data is encrypted at rest using AES256  bit encryption and data in transit is protected by Transport Layer  Security (“TLS”). |
| Measures for ensuring physical  security of locations at which  Personal Data are processed | The Processor utilises third party data centres that maintain  current ISO 27001 certifications and/or SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type II  or SOC 2 Attestation Reports. The Processor will not utilise third  party data centres that do not maintain the aforementioned  certifications and/or attestations, or other substantially similar or  equivalent certifications and/or attestations. The Processor’s  main office is secured with keypad entry. The keypad entry  requires access to a secure PIN. |
| Measures for ensuring events  logging | System inputs are recorded in the form of log files therefore it is  possible to review retroactively whether and by whom Personal  Data was entered, altered or deleted. |
| Measures for ensuring system  configuration, including default  configuration | System configuration is applied and maintained by software tools  that ensure the system configurations do not deviate from the  specifications. |
| Measures for internal IT and IT  security governance and  management | Employees are instructed to collect, process and use Personal  Data only within the framework and for the purposes of their duties  (e.g. service provision). At a technical level, multi-client capability  includes separation of functions as well as appropriate separation  of testing and production systems.  The Controller’s Personal Data is stored in a way that logically  separates it from other customer data. |
| Measures for  certification/assurance of processes  and products | The Processor utilises third party data centres that maintain  current ISO 27001 certifications and/or SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type II  or SOC 2 Attestation Reports. The Processor will not utilise third  party data centres that do not maintain the aforementioned  certifications and/or attestations, or other substantially similar or  equivalent certifications and/or attestations.  Upon the Controller’s written request (no more than once in any  12 month period), the Processor shall provide within a reasonable  time, a copy of the most recently completed certification and/or |
|     | attestation reports (to the extent that to do so does not prejudice  the overall security of the Services). Any audit report submitted to  the Controller shall be treated as Confidential Information and  subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Agreement between  the parties |
| Measures for ensuring data  minimisation | If Personal Data is no longer required for the purposes for which  it was processed, it is deleted promptly. It should be noted that  with each deletion, the Personal Data is only locked in the first  instance and is then deleted for good with a certain delay. This is  done in order to prevent accidental deletions or possible  intentional damage. |
| Measures for ensuring data quality | All of the data that the Processor possesses is provided by the  Controller. The Processor not assess the quality of the data  provided by the Controller. The Processor provides reporting tools  within our product to help the Controller understand and validate  the data that is stored. |
| Measures for ensuring limited data  retention | The Processor uses a data classification scheme for all data that  it stores and our retention policy specifies how each type of data  is retained. When a record with Personal Data is deleted then it  will be permanently evicted from our active databases. The data  is retained in our backups until they are rotated out by more recent  backups per the data retention policy. |
| Measures for ensuring  accountability | All employees that handle sensitive data must acknowledge the  information security policies. These employees are re-trained on  information security policies once per year. A disciplinary policy is  in place for employees that do not adhere to information security  policies. |
| Measures for allowing data  portability and ensuring erasure | The Services have built-in tools that allows the Controller to export  and permanently erase data. |
| Measures to be taken by the (Sub-)  processor to be able to provide  assistance to the Controller (and, for  transfers from a Processor to a Sub processor, to the Data Exporter). | The transfer of Personal Data to a third party (e.g. customers, sub contractors, service providers) is only made if a corresponding  contract exists, and only for the specific purposes. If Personal  Data is transferred outside the EEA, the Processor provides that  an adequate level of data protection exists at the target location  or organisation in accordance with the European Union’s data  protection requirements, e.g. by employing contracts based on  the EU SCCs. |
