    **Generally****.** **Arbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, Oral Care Products, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use (defined [here](#top)), your relationship with Oral Care Products, or these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use of the products, your attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Oral Care Products or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, Oral Care Products, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Oral Care Products agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against Oral Care Products. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.**
    
    **Exceptions to Binding Arbitration****.** **As an exception to binding arbitration, you and Oral Care Products both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. Oral Care Products will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court. Binding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.**
    
    **Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures****.** **You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against Oral Care Products, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely. You may send the written description by U.S. Mail to Oral Care Products, LLC, 100 N Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1600, El Segundo, CA 90245; Attn: Legal. You agree to negotiate with Oral Care Products in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after Oral Care Products' receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.**
    
    **Commencement of Arbitration****.** **You and Oral Care Products agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.**
    
    **Arbitration Location****.** **For your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in the federal district where you reside. It may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Oral Care Products agree.**
    
    **Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator****.** **You agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim. The arbitrator shall be chosen from JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.**
    
    **The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use and Conditions of Sale and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Oral Care Products.**
    
    **Arbitration Fees****.** **Oral Care Products shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party. The parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.**
    
    **Arbitration Award****.** **The arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law. The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it. Although Oral Care Products may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Oral Care Products agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator’s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law. Any award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.**
    
    **Enforceability****.** **This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Oral Care Products, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.**
    
    **Miscellaneous****.** **Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Oral Care Products and shall not be modified except in writing by Oral Care Products.**
    
    **Amendments****.** **Oral Care Products reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of any Oral Care Products Website, purchase of an Oral Care Products, or use or attempted use of an Oral Care Products, is affirmation of your consent to such changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Oral Care Products will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of any Oral Care Products Website, purchase of an Oral Care Products, or use or attempted use of an Oral Care Products, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.**
    
    **YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF AN ORAL CARE PRODUCTS (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO ORAL CARE PRODUCTS, LLC, 100 N SEPULVEDA BLVD., SUITE 1600, EL SEGUNDO, CA 90245; ATTN: LEGAL. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE IDENTIFYING ANY ORAL CARE PRODUCTS' PRODUCT YOU PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE WITHIN THE 30 DAYS AND THE DATE YOU FIRST PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE ORAL CARE PRODUCTS. UNTIMELY OPT-OUTS WILL NOT BE VALID AND YOU MUST THEN PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS.**

You linked to this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") via a product website owned by The Oral Care Products, LLC ("Company", "us", "our" or "we").

### 1\. Information Collection

We collect personal information about you via our Websites when you provide it through various forms and places on the Websites such as in connection with a request or purchase of a product, service, or information or if you register for a Website account. You may browse our Websites without providing any personal information; however, if, for example, you decide to place an order, we will ask you for your name, age, delivery and billing address, phone number(s), email address, and payment information such as credit/debit card number, expiration dates, PayPal or third-party payment information. If you choose to complete a user registration form or survey, we may ask you for personal information, such as your contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address and mailing address). Occasionally, we may also ask you for other demographic information, such as gender, income level, and information about your prior experiences with the Company's products. If we combine demographic information with the personal information, we collect directly from you on our Websites, we will treat the combined data as personal information under this Privacy Policy. When you submit your personal information or demographic information on one of the Websites, you are giving your consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Websites, such as when they submit your information to us about you. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Websites with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. For example, if you choose to have your purchase delivered to another person’s address, we may ask for the other person’s name and delivery address. We will use this information to deliver your purchase to the address you choose to have it delivered. You may delete the other person’s information from your account or the other person may contact us at [privacy@smileactives.com](mailto:privacy@smileactives.com) to request that we remove their information from our database. Note: Although you can remove the information from your account for future orders, the other person’s information may be retained with the original transaction for auditing and legal purposes. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.

We may also use the tracking technologies described in Section 6 below in order to automatically (or passively) collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular and remembering you and your preferences, your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier, device functionality (including browser, operator system, hardware, mobile network information), device location, device characteristics, city, time zone, and referring URL. Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics, developing marketing plans, customizing content, and improving the Website. This usage information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device whenever you visit or interact with our Site. We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, partners and other third parties.

We may combine automatically collected Website usage information with your Personal Information. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

All of our Websites are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. We will delete any personal information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us, please contact Customer Service using the contact information below.

In addition, we may share the information we have collected about you, including personal information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.

We may contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services including email and hosting services, credit card processing, shipping, data management, surveys and marketing, promotional services, to assist in preventing or deterring fraud, etc. We call them our “Service Providers”. We may share personally identifiable information with Service Providers solely as appropriate for them to perform their functions, but they may not use such information for any other purpose.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless its excessive, repetitive, manifestly unfounded, or in accordance with applicable law. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

You may only make a verifiable or authenticated consumer request twice within a twelve (12) month period. If we have collected information on your minor child, you may exercise the above rights on behalf of your minor child. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, you may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf. The request must include:

* Sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to the request.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify or authenticate your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you.

You are not required to create an account with us to submit a verifiable or authenticated consumer request. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable or authenticated consumer request to verify your (or your authorized agent’s as applicable) identity or authority to make the request.

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

### 4\. Information Security

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security protocol that protects your credit card information and ensures secure online ordering. SSL Internet connections are encrypted, and thus protect all credit card ordering information, including your name, address, and credit card number, so it cannot be read in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal information. Please note, however, that although we employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard the security of your personal information, no transmissions made on or through the Internet are guaranteed to be secure. Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Website and provide us with your information at your own risk.

### 5\. Access and Choice

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at [privacy@smileactives.com](mailto:privacy@smileactives.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

### 6\. Technology Utilized / Tracking Technologies

We and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, browser fingerprinting, recognition technologies and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the Website, tracking users’ movements around the Websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. This information may be combined with information collected from other third-party sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purpose of determining whether you may be interested in receiving direct mail.

Our Website utilizes tracking technologies to collect and record your activities and movements across our websites throughout your browsing session, including to track clicks/touches, mouse movements, scrolling, keystrokes, data entered, device information and orientation, and screen size (“session data”), for purposes of our own internal analytics and improving our products, services, and user experience. We may share session data with our third-party analytics or service providers for these purposes, who will use the session data solely on our behalf and for our benefit. Please review how you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of session data in [Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase](https://www.smileactives.com/policies/terms-of-service#User-Generated).

There may be other tracking technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Website. Further, third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Websites, which may include the collection and storing of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

We and third-party vendors, including Google and Facebook, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie), device fingerprinting, web beacons, and other storage technologies together to collect or receive information to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Websites and elsewhere on the Internet. Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our Websites and/or other sites and online services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google’s use of first-party cookies, [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies, visit the DoubleClick opt-out page, [here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCgv9njqsouM0cZFc3SjcVqqva4wB8uVg_hlXCGd51hOO8E9RvtuxfLFeTBSJmiYMsuXwWAioi73yxkNwdFP3tMYjenEPWstrEYcEZNha1r7OReChxU).

We use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

### 7\. Do Not Track Signals

Some web browsers are developing or offering signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal). A DNT signal is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. We do not monitor or take any action with respect to DNT signals.

### 8\. Ads and Information About You

We may work with third parties, such as network advertisers and ad exchanges that use tracking technologies on our Websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and/or on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet and we may use third-party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third-party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities (including past visits to our Websites) across the Internet and mobile media (“Behavioral Ads”). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third-party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your device and track certain behavioral usage information via a device identifier. These third-party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.

Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.

Further, while sites use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout\_nonppii.asp,](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. You may also opt-out of receiving Behavioral Ads on participating sites and services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Similar limitations may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties opt-out options or programs. Deleting browser cookies and/or using a different browser (for e.g., in-app browsers on mobile) will remove the cookie preferences you have selected, including do not sell my personally identifiable information. As a result, you may need to opt-out again in the future to maintain your preferences.

### 9\. External Links

Our Websites may offer links to and from other third-party sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. For example, you may have linked to the Company’s brand site through a banner advertisement on another site. In such cases the site you have linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

### 10\. Social Media Widgets

Our Websites include social media features (“Features”), such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive applications or mini programs that run on our Websites. These Features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. If you click on social media icons on the Website (such as for Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), those actions may be associated with, and we may have access to, your Personal Information you provided on those third-party sites or applications. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Websites. Features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Websites. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Website.

### 11\. Blogs/Forums

    **PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.**
    
    **YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.**
    
    **Generally****.** **Arbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, Oral Care Products, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use (defined [here](#top)), your relationship with Oral Care Products, or these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use of the products, your attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Oral Care Products or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, Oral Care Products, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Oral Care Products agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against Oral Care Products. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.**
    
    **Exceptions to Binding Arbitration****.** **As an exception to binding arbitration, you and Oral Care Products both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. Oral Care Products will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court. Binding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.**
    
    **Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures****.** **You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against Oral Care Products, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely. You may send the written description by U.S. Mail to Oral Care Products, LLC, 100 N Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1600, El Segundo, CA 90245; Attn: Legal. You agree to negotiate with Oral Care Products in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after Oral Care Products' receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.**
    
    **Commencement of Arbitration****.** **You and Oral Care Products agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.**
    
    **Arbitration Location****.** **For your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in the federal district where you reside. It may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Oral Care Products agree.**
    
    **Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator****.** **You agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim. The arbitrator shall be chosen from JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.**
    
    **The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use and Conditions of Sale and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Oral Care Products.**
    
    **Arbitration Fees****.** **Oral Care Products shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party. The parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.**
    
    **Arbitration Award****.** **The arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law. The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it. Although Oral Care Products may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Oral Care Products agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator’s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law. Any award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.**
    
    **Enforceability****.** **This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Oral Care Products, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.**
    
    **Miscellaneous****.** **Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Oral Care Products and shall not be modified except in writing by Oral Care Products.**
    
    **Amendments****.** **Oral Care Products reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of any Oral Care Products Website, purchase of an Oral Care Products, or use or attempted use of an Oral Care Products, is affirmation of your consent to such changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Oral Care Products will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of any Oral Care Products Website, purchase of an Oral Care Products, or use or attempted use of an Oral Care Products, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.**
    
    **YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF AN ORAL CARE PRODUCTS (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO ORAL CARE PRODUCTS, LLC, 100 N SEPULVEDA BLVD., SUITE 1600, EL SEGUNDO, CA 90245; ATTN: LEGAL.
