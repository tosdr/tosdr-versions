### FUND COLLECTION BY MEMBERS; PAYMENTS TO MEMBERS.

Some BudgetPulse members may request contribution for their saving goals. Individual contribution amount is at the discretion of each member, who decides whether such contribution required, the amount frequency, payment options, refund policies, and how such payment are spent. You may also have the option to make voluntary contributions to particular member. Contribution requested by members is remitted to the members and not to BudgetPulse. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay contribution requested by a member, you acknowledge that BudgetPulse does not control the transaction, and that you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any member are subject to that member's policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to a member is in error, you must contact the member to seek resolution. You should use your own discretion and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to a member. Members have full discretion whether and how to spend money in connection with their saving goals. We cannot ensure that a member is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of members’ saving goals, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the applicable member.

BudgetPulse also makes no guarantees regarding the performance or fairness of its payment services, PayPal and Amazon. BudgetPulse shall not be liable for your interactions with any organizations and/or individuals found on or through the BudgetPulse services. This includes, but is not limited to, delivery of goods and services through BudgetPulse.
