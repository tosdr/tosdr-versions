#### Privacy Information

Privacy Information

  
When using our website and during business cooperation with us, personal data is processed. The entity  
responsible for processing is Global Event Technologies GmbH &amp; Co KG, Neualmerstraße 37, 5400 Hallein, Austria  
("GET"). For questions about data protection at GET or to exercise your rights, please contact our Data Protection  
Officer at [privacy@get.systems](mailto:privacy@get.systems).

  
You have the right to access, rectify, and delete your data, the right to restrict processing, to object to processing  
(particularly to object to direct marketing), as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

  
Your data will generally not be disclosed to third parties unless it is absolutely necessary for fulfilling the purpose of  
the processing or legally required. We also share data with service providers (processors) who technically support  
us in providing systems. However, these processors are not permitted to use the data for their own purposes and  
are bound by additional agreements to the strict provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation.

  
Data processing typically takes place within the European Union. Should data be transferred to countries outside  
the European Union in exceptional cases (e.g., for error analysis) or if a service provider does not offer processing  
within the European Union, we ensure that either an adequacy decision by the EU Commission for the respective  
country exists or the EU Standard Contractual Clauses are concluded to ensure a high level of data protection.

  
Data Processing on Our Website

  
Web Server Logs  
When you access our website, information about the access (date, time, viewed page, IP address) is stored as log  
files on our server. This is done out of legitimate interest to monitor technical operations, optimize our information  
offering, and detect attacks on our website. We evaluate these data exclusively for our own statistical purposes in  
an anonymized form. The log files are deleted after three months.

  
General Inquiries / Support Form  
When you contact us via email, phone, instant messenger, or online chat, your personal data will be processed for  
customer support purposes to respond to your inquiry (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR) and based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR) to optimize the quality of our customer service and for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal  
claims for no longer than three years. The processed data includes your email address (when using email as a  
communication channel), your phone number (when contacting us by phone), the IP address of your device (when  
using instant messenger or online chat), and the respective communication contents or data required to respond to  
the inquiry.

  
Support Chat (Intercom)  
In addition to contacting us via email, you can also communicate with our support team via an online chat. For this,  
we use the services of Intercom (www.intercom.com). Our partner Intercom is not permitted to use the collected  
data for their own purposes and is bound by a data processing agreement to the requirements of the General Data  
Protection Regulation. Data is only transferred to Intercom if you explicitly activate the support chat.

  
Intercom Inc. is committed to complying with the provisions of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which has  
been recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data. Therefore, no  
further legal basis is required for data transfer to the USA according to Art. 45 GDPR.

  
For answering your questions or selecting responses from the support team, methods of artificial intelligence may  
be used. However, these are not used for automated decision-making or creating user profiles, but solely to select  
the most likely correct answer based on an extensive knowledge database.

This website uses software to analyze the usage of the website. By evaluating this data, valuable insights into the  
needs of users can be gained, which helps to further improve the quality of the offering.

wix.com, is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and thus guarantees a level of data protection  
comparable to that in the EU. According to Art. 45 GDPR, no additional legal basis is required for the transfer of  
data to Wix Inc.

complying with the measures of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). The EU Commission has certified that  
participants of the DPF achieve a level of data protection comparable to the EU. Therefore, according to Art. 45

General Information on the Processing of Personal Data of Customers, Prospective Customers, Suppliers, and Other Business Partners

  
In the course of the business relationship with GET, personal data of customers, prospective customers, suppliers,  
or other business partners is processed for the purposes of ordering and delivering products and services, sales  
activities, purchasing, accounting, customer support, and for sending direct advertising. This processing is based on  
existing contracts, pre-contractual measures, or on GET's legitimate interest in sending direct advertising.

The processed data includes names and contact details, any agreements, and communication or order history. The  
provision of this data is necessary for the business relationship, as contractual or statutory obligations cannot  
otherwise be fulfilled.

  
The data will be stored for a maximum of three years after the last contact following the expiration of the statutory  
retention periods (usually seven years).

  
Information on the Processing of Applicant Data  
If you apply for a position advertised by GET, the data you provide will be processed for the purpose of applicant  
selection and for creating statistical evaluations. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 (1) b GDPR (pre-  
contractual measures). Please note that for some positions, especially in security areas (e.g., system  
administration), additional information may be requested.

  
If an employment relationship is established, GET, as your employer, will retain your data for the duration of your  
employment and delete it after the end of your employment following the statutory retention periods. If no  
employment relationship is established, the data will be stored for seven months after the conclusion of the  
application process and then anonymized, so that no personal reference can be made. A longer retention period  
will only occur if you have given us separate consent.

  
Data will generally not be forwarded to third parties. Exceptions include forwarding to technical service providers  
(processors) who support GET in managing applicant data, but these service providers are not allowed to use the  
data for their own purposes and are bound by separate agreements to the strict provisions of the General Data  
Protection Regulation.

  
Special Provisions for Video Conferences and Online Meetings with Microsoft Teams  
During the conduct of online meetings or video conferences, personal data such as contact details, video, and audio  
data are processed. This processing is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations or pre-contractual measures (e.g.,  
employment contract for employees, preliminary discussions for projects) if no other, less severe means can be  
used as efficiently and is only carried out for the duration of the respective meeting.

  
Data on participation in the online meeting and any text entered by participants in the chat window of the meeting  
will be deleted after the statutory retention periods (generally seven years).

  
In exceptional cases, recordings of the online meeting may be made for documentation, quality control, or creating  
minutes. This is done either to fulfill contractual obligations or in GET's legitimate interest in the previously  
mentioned processing purposes and only after informing all present participants. You have the right to object to  
the processing if you are in a particular situation where your rights and freedoms outweigh GET's interests.  
Recordings will only be stored as long as necessary to achieve the respective processing purpose, such as creating  
and confirming minutes.

​

Data processed during online meetings is generally not disclosed without consent, unless required by law or  
contractually necessary. Exceptions include the transfer to processors who work exclusively on GET's instructions,  
do not use the data for their own purposes, and are bound by separate agreements to the data protection  
obligations of the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as the transfer of diagnostic and telemetry data  
necessary for the operation and security of the online meeting infrastructure, which may also contain personal  
data, to Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd., One Microsoft Place, Dublin, D18 P521, Ireland. In rare cases, this also  
involves data transfers to countries outside the European Union. Microsoft has committed to complying with the  
EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection  
for personal data. Therefore, according to Art. 45 GDPR, no further legal basis is required for the transfer of data to  
the USA.
