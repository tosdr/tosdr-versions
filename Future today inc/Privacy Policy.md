Our Role with Respect to Your Personal Data

Within the scope of this Policy, Future Today acts as a data controller or “business” for the Personal Data we process. This means that we decide how and why Personal Data is collected and further processed.

* * *

Lawful Bases for Processing

The GDPR and other applicable data protection laws require that we have a valid reason to use your Personal Data. This is called the “lawful basis for processing.” We may process your Personal Data:

* Because you gave your consent.
* Because we need to perform a contract with you.
* Because we have a legitimate interest in processing your Personal Data and it is not overridden by your rights. Some of those interests include:
    * Monetizing your use of the Service with ads which are relevant to you.
    * Enhancing, modifying, personalizing or otherwise improve our Service and communications for the benefits of our customers.
    * Identifying and preventing fraud.
    * Enhancing the security of our network and information systems.
    * Determining the success of our Service, promotional campaigns, and advertising.
* Because we need to comply with the law.
* On another ground, as required or permitted by law.

When we rely on legitimate interests as a lawful basis of processing, you have the right to ask us more about how we decided to choose this legal basis and object to this processing. To do so, please use the contact details provided [here](#contact_us).  
Where we process your or your child’s Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect the validity of our processing of Personal Data performed on other lawful grounds.  
Where we receive your Personal Data as part of the provision of the Service to/from you or your brand to fulfil a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract. Without that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide the Service to you or fulfill our contractual obligations with you.

Transfers of Personal Data Outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom

Some of the third parties we send Personal Data to are located outside of the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) and the United Kingdom (“**UK**”). In some cases, the European Commission or the UK Secretary of State may have determined that the data protection laws of some countries provide a level of protection equivalent to EU or UK law. You can see [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) the list of countries that the European Commission has recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to personal data.  
We will only transfer your Personal Data to third parties outside the EEA or the UK to countries not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to Personal Data when there are appropriate safeguards in place. We may achieve such enhanced protection by placing obligations on the recipient of the data with the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) approved by the European Commission under [Article 46.2 of the GDPR](https://gdpr.verasafe.com/article-46/).

Other Disclosures of Your Personal Data

We may disclose your Personal Data to the extent required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that we need to disclose it in order to comply with official investigations or legal proceedings (whether initiated by governmental/law enforcement officials, or private parties). If we have to disclose your Personal Data to governmental/law enforcement officials, we may not be able to ensure that those officials will maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Data.  
We may also disclose your Personal Data if we sell or transfer all or some of our company’s business interests, assets, or both, or in connection with a corporate restructuring.

Please allow us up to thirty (30) calendar days to reply to your requests (except requests to stop selling your Personal Data) from the day we received your request. If we need more time (up to ninety (90) days in total), we will inform you of the reason why and the extension period in writing.  
If your request is covered by the CCPA, consider that we will only cover the twelve-month period preceding the moment we receive your request in any disclosures we provide you with.  
We will act upon your request to opt out from the sale of your Personal Data within fifteen (15) business days. We will also notify the third parties to whom we sold your Personal Data of your request and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Data. We will inform you about this in ninety (90) calendar days from the receipt of your request.  
If we cannot satisfy a request, we will explain why in our response. For data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without difficulty.  
We will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. However, we may charge a fee if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority

If the GDPR applies to our processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data.  
Specifically, you can lodge a complaint in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or the alleged violation of the GDPR.

Privacy of Children

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to us. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data that can directly identify anyone under the age of sixteen (16).  
If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personally identifiable information, please [contact us](#contact_us). If we become aware that we have collected personally identifiable information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. Viewers under the age of 16 must use the Future Today Inc. sites under adult supervision. Parents can contact us to exercise their rights to access, modify, delete, or stop further collection of their child’s personal information.  
Future Today adheres to the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) and the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (“CARU”) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in the parts of our Service directed to children under the age of thirteen (13). Please help us protect your children’s privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information (like their full name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number, etc.) without your permission.

We are strongly committed to keeping your Personal Data safe. We have implemented and will maintain technical, administrative, and physical measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized processing. Unauthorized processing includes unauthorized access, exfiltration, theft, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
