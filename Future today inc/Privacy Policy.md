* * *

Lawful Bases for Processing

The GDPR and other applicable data protection laws require that we have a valid reason to use your Personal Data. This is called the “lawful basis for processing.” We may process your Personal Data:

* Because you gave your consent.
* Because we need to perform a contract with you.
* Because we have a legitimate interest in processing your Personal Data and it is not overridden by your rights. Some of those interests include:
    * Monetizing your use of the Service with ads which are relevant to you.
    * Enhancing, modifying, personalizing or otherwise improving our Service and communications for the benefits of our customers.
    * Identifying and preventing fraud.
    * Enhancing the security of our network and information systems.
    * Determining the success of our Service, promotional campaigns, and advertising.

When we rely on legitimate interests as a lawful basis of processing, you have the right to ask us more about how we decided to choose this legal basis and object to this processing. To do so, please use the contact details provided [here](#contact_us).  
Where we process your or your child’s Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before your withdrawal of consent. It will also not affect the validity of our processing of Personal Data performed on other lawful grounds.  
Where we receive your Personal Data as part of the provision of the Service to/from you or your brand to fulfill a contract, we require such Personal Data to be able to carry out the contract. Without that necessary Personal Data, we will not be able to provide the Service to you or fulfill our contractual obligations with you.

If you do not want your data to be processed in the USA or other countries, do not use the Service, and do not provide us with your Personal Data.  
Future Today will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including safeguards protecting the security of your data and other personal information.

Transfers of Personal Data Outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom

Some of the third parties we send Personal Data to are located outside of the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) and the United Kingdom (“**UK**”). In some cases, the European Commission or the UK Secretary of State may have determined that the data protection laws of some countries provide a level of protection equivalent to EU or UK law. You can see [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) the list of countries that the European Commission has recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to personal data.  
We will only transfer your Personal Data to third parties outside the EEA or the UK to countries not recognized as providing an adequate level of protection to Personal Data when there are appropriate safeguards in place. We may achieve such enhanced protection by placing obligations on the recipient of the data with the [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) approved by the European Commission under [Article 46.2 of the GDPR](https://gdpr.verasafe.com/article-46/).

What Privacy Rights Do You Have?

You have specific rights regarding your Personal Data that we collect and process.  
In this section, we first describe those rights and then we explain [how you can exercise those rights](#top). Please note that since we do not collect sensitive Personal Data, we do not offer a “right to limit” the processing of sensitive personal information under U.S. Privacy Laws. Similarly, we do not profile you to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects and therefore do not offer a right to opt out of such processing.

* * *

Right to Know What Happens to Your Personal Data

This is also called the right to be informed. It means that you have the right to obtain from us all information regarding our data processing activities that concern you (or your child), such as how we collect and use your Personal Data, how long we will keep it, and who it will be shared with, among other things. This Privacy Policy provides you with the information required by that right, and if we update our processing activities we will notify you as set forth in the “Changes to this Policy” section below.

* * *

Right to Know What Personal Data We Have About You

This is also called the right of access. This right allows you to ask for full details of the Personal Data we hold on you, including confirmation of whether we process Personal Data concerning you (or your child), and, where that is the case, a copy or access to the Personal Data and certain related information.  
Once we receive and [confirm](#privacy_rights) that the request came from you or your authorized agent, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of your Personal Data that we process
* The categories of sources for your Personal Data
* Our purposes for processing your Personal Data
* Where possible, the retention period for your Personal Data, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine the retention period
* The categories of third parties with whom we share your Personal Data
* If we carry out automated decision-making, including profiling, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for you
* The specific pieces of Personal Data we process about you in an easily sharable format
* If we sold or disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose, the categories of Personal Data and categories of recipients of that Personal Data for both sale and disclosure
* If we rely on legitimate interests as a lawful basis to process your Personal Data, the specific legitimate interests
* The appropriate safeguards used to transfer Personal Data from the EEA or the UK to a third country, if applicable

Under some circumstances, we may deny your access request. In that event, we will respond to you with the reason for the denial.

* * *

Right to Change Your Personal Data

This is also called the right to rectification or correction. This right entitles you to ask us to correct without undue delay anything that you think is wrong with the Personal Data we have on file about you (or your child), and to complete any incomplete Personal Data.

* * *

Right to Delete Your Personal Data

This is called the **right to erasure, right to deletion, or the right to be forgotten**. This right means you can ask for your Personal Data to be deleted.  
Sometimes we can delete your information, but other times it is not possible for either technical or legal reasons. If that is the case, [we will consider if we can limit how we use it](#right_to_ask). We will also inform you of our reason for denying your deletion request.

* * *

Right to Ask us to Limit How We Process Your Personal Data

This is called the right to restrict processing. It is the right to ask us to only use or store your Personal Data for certain purposes. You have this right in certain instances, such as where you believe the data is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful.

* * *

Right to Ask Us to Stop Using Your Personal Data

This is called the **right to object**. This is your right to tell us to indefinitely stop using your Personal Data. You have this right where we rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party) as the lawful basis for processing your Personal Data. You may also object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for _direct_ marketing purposes.  
We will stop processing the relevant Personal Data unless:

* we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms; or

* we need to continue processing your Personal Data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.

* * *

Right to Port or Move Your Personal Data

This is called the **right to data portability**. It is the right to ask for and receive a portable copy of your Personal Data that you have given us or that we have observed from your use of our services, so that you can:  

* Move it;
* Copy it;
* Keep it for yourself.; and/or
* Transfer it to another organization.

Note that under the GDPR, the right to data portability only applies when:

* our lawful basis for processing this information is consent or for the performance of a contract; and
* we are carrying out the processing by automated means.

Please note that, under the GDPR, the right does not cover any data that we may have created based on the data you have provided to us.  
When this right applies to you and it is technically feasible, we will provide your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. When you request this information electronically, we will provide you with a copy in electronic format.

* * *

Right to Withdraw Your Consent

Where we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, our use of your Personal Data before you withdraw is still lawful.  
If you have given consent for your details to be shared with a third party and wish to withdraw this consent, please also contact the relevant third party to change your preferences.

* * *

Right to Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless the applicable data protection or privacy laws permit it, we will not:

* deny you the Service.
* charge you different prices or rates for the Service including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.
* provide you a different level or quality of the Service.
* suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for the Service or a different level or quality of the Service.

* * *

Your Right to Opt Out of the Sale, , Sharing of Personal Data or Targeted Advertising

Our disclosure of certain device-based information such as your device and advertising identifiers may qualify as a “sale,” “sharing,” “profiling”, or “targeted advertising” under certain data protection and privacy laws.  
Some of those laws give you the right to opt out of such “sales,” “sharing,” “profiling”, or targeted advertising. To exercise this right to opt-out, see “How Can You Exercise Your Privacy Rights?” below.  
In addition, you may alter your settings in your device as explained in [this](#limit_ad) section. If your device does not offer options to limit ad tracking, contact us as we explain [here](#privacy_rights).  
Please consider that when you change your device tracking preferences to limit ad tracking or we handle the request for you, you will receive the same number of ads, but they will be less relevant to you.  
Once you make an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sale or sharing of your Personal Data for at least twelve months. However, if you change your mind, you may opt back into Personal Data sales, sharing or targeted advertising at any time by changing your preferences in the Future Today Privacy Center within the Service.  
Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt out through a Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) enabled browser setting. If you have this right, when you use your Service with a GPC-enabled browser, we will treat our initial receipt of the GPC signal as a valid request to opt out, as defined by applicable U.S. Privacy Laws granting this right. Please note that if you are logged out, our processing of the signal will be limited to the specific browser that you are using. You may need to renew your opt‑out choice if you use a different browser to access our Service.  
We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the Personal Data of individuals that we know are less than sixteen (16) years old.

* * *

Your Right to Opt into the Sale of Personal Data

If you have directed us not to sell your Personal Data, you can opt into the sale of your Personal Data at any time by changing your ad-tracking preferences in your smart device as we explain [here](#limit_ad). If your device does not offer options to enable again ad tracking, contact us as we explain [here](#privacy_rights).  
In addition, we do not knowingly sell the Personal Data of individuals that we know are less than sixteen (16) years old.

When contacting us, please provide us with proof that the individual gave you signed permission to submit this request, a valid power of attorney on behalf of the individual, or proof of parental responsibility or legal guardianship.

Response Timing and Format of Our Responses

Please allow us up to thirty (30) calendar days to reply to your requests (except requests to stop selling your Personal Data) from the day we received your request. If we need more time (up to ninety (90) days in total), we will inform you of the reason why and the extension period in writing.  
If your request is covered by the CCPA, consider that we will only cover the twelve-month period preceding the moment we receive your request in any disclosures we provide you with.  
We will act upon your request to opt out from the sale of your Personal Data within fifteen (15) business days. We will also notify the third parties to whom we sold your Personal Data of your request and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Data. We will inform you about this in ninety (90) calendar days from the receipt of your request.  
If we cannot satisfy a request, we will explain why in our response. For data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without difficulty.  
We will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. However, we may charge a fee if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority

If the GDPR applies to our processing of your Personal Data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are not satisfied with how we process your Personal Data.  
Specifically, you can lodge a complaint in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or the alleged violation of the GDPR.

* * *

Privacy of Children

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. When we provide our free Service, we do not attempt to associate information with particular individuals. Any accounts with our service must be for ages 16+, and viewers under the age of sixteen (16) must use the Service under adult supervision. As a result, we do not knowingly collect information about anyone under the age of sixteen  
We do recognize that certain parts of our Service may be child-directed in terms of the content. For those parts of our Service, Future Today adheres to the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”) and the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (“CARU”) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. To the extent parts of our Service are child-directed, we strictly limit the data collection to device information necessary to provide the Service, we mask IP addresses and IP addresses, we do not process the information for targeted advertising, and we do not collect any direct personal identifiers or make any attempts to identify individuals under the age of thirteen (13). Please note that we may still serve geo-targeted contextual advertising (such as an advertisement for a child’s toy or parenting product) and process the information for frequency capping purposes and other operational advertising purposes, but that advertising will not be based on the individual viewer.  
As the parent or guardian, please help us protect your children’s privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information (like their full name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number, etc.) without your permission. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with information that would allow us or anybody to directly identify them (“personally identifiable information”), please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personally identifiable information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. Parents can also contact us to exercise their rights to access, modify, delete, or stop further collection of their child’s personal information.

* * *

Data Integrity & Security

We are strongly committed to keeping your Personal Data safe. We have implemented and will maintain technical, administrative, and physical measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized processing. Unauthorized processing includes unauthorized access, exfiltration, theft, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

* * *

Changes to this Policy

If we make any changes to this Policy, we will post the revised Policy to this web page. We will also update the “Last updated” date. By continuing to use our Service after we post any of these changes, you accept the modified Policy. We may communicate any changes with you from time to time in a manner we determine.
