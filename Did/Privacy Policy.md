2. **HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA** 

2. 1\. Security. We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational and security measures designed to protect your Personal Data. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be compromised as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers.

2. 2\. Retention of your Personal Data. Your Personal Data will be stored until we delete the record and we proactively delete it or you send a valid deletion request. Please note that in some circumstances we may store your Personal Data for longer periods of time, for example (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Data or dealings. Regarding retention of cookies, you can read more in our [cookie policy](https://www.d-id.com/cookies-policy/).

We may share your Personal Data as follows:

3. 4\. If, in the future, we sell or transfer, or we consider selling or transferring, some or all of our business, shares or assets to a third party, we will disclose your Personal Data to such third party (whether actual or potential) in connection with the foregoing events;

3. 5\. In the event that we are acquired by, or merged with, a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer, disclose or assign your Personal Data in connection with the foregoing events, including, in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or to another company; and/or

4. 2\. External transfers: Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of EU/EEA (for example to third parties who provide us with services), we will generally obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. When D-ID engages in such transfers of Personal Data, it relies on i) Adequacy Decisions as adopted by European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) (for example, when we access from Israel), or ii) Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the European Commission. D-ID also continually monitors the circumstances surrounding such transfers in order to ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by the GDPR. 

5. **YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS. HOW TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT**

5. 1\. Rights: The following rights (which may be subject to certain exemptions or derogations) shall apply to certain individuals (some of which only apply to individuals protected by the GDPR):

* You have the right to request that we rectify any Personal Data we hold that is inaccurate or misleading;

* You have the right to object, to or to request restriction, of the processing;
* You have the right to data portability. This means that you may have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and that you have the right to transmit that data to another controller;
* You have the right to object to profiling;
* You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that there may be circumstances in which we are entitled to continue processing your data, in particular if the processing is required to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. Also, please note that the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
* You also have a right to request certain details of the basis on which your Personal Data is transferred outside the European Economic Area, but data transfer agreements and/or other details may need to be partially redacted for reasons of commercial confidentiality;
* You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority (i.e., your place of habitual residence, place or work or place of alleged infringement) at any time or before the relevant institutions in your place of residence.

When processing your request, we may ask you for additional information to confirm or verify your identity and for security purposes, before processing and/or honoring your request. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In the event that your request would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others (for example, would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others) or if we are legally entitled to deal with your request in a different way than initial requested, we will address your request to the maximum extent possible, all in accordance with applicable law. 

5. 3\. Deleting your account: Should you ever decide to delete your account, you may do so over the D-ID Products or by emailing [support@d-id.com](mailto:support@d-id.com). If you terminate your account, any association between your account and Personal Data we store will no longer be accessible through your account.

11. **APPLICATIVE DATA RETENTION**

We use commercially reasonable efforts to retain non-customer Personal Data and Applicative Data in accordance with the below:

11. 1\. Applicative Data uploaded through the API which is not deleted by the user upon completion of a job (See [docs.d-id.com](http://docs.d-id.com/)) is erased automatically, through AWS settings, within 24h.

11. 2.  While in the storage, awaiting processing or deletion, the Applicative Data is not accessed for any purpose, including not accessed for model training.

11. 3.  Users may set a “persist” flag when uploading the data via the API in which case it will be kept, on an encrypted AWS S3 storage, until erased by the user (See the delete function for every entry in the api doc https://docs.d-id.com/reference/get-started). Knowledge Documents which are uploaded to the Agent, in order to constitute a knowledge base for such Agent and in turn serves as the basis for the response for such Agent’s users, are persistent.

11. 4.  Users may optionally provide via the API a signed URL pointing to the input data at their AWS S3 storage and optionally provide a signed URL pointing to their AWS S3 storage for placing the result in which case the result is not stored in D-ID’s system.

11. 5.  Applicative Data uploaded through the web [https://studio.d-id.com/](https://studio.d-id.com/) is kept as persistent until erased by the user at the studio website. Data uploaded to the studio will be visible in the studio’s webpage and may be deleted by the user at any time.

11. 6.  The user may query the SaaS API for all persistent data elements. Those can be erased via the Delete APIs at any time.

11. 7.  D-ID may delete the information 14 days after contract expiration (including a specific service) and after sending an email notification.

11. 8.  Data of inactive users, i.e. users who did not log in for a consecutive period of 180 days, will be deleted after 14 days and after sending an email notification.

11. 9.  Applicative Data may be accessed by authorized operators as a result of a customer support ticket or an operational case service ticket.
