10. **Disclaimers**
-------------------

Our Service and all content on EPAL.GG are provided on an “as is” basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.

11. **Limitation** **of** **Liability**
---------------------------------------

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EPAL.GG SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES. IN NO EVENT SHALL EPAL.GG’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS (US $100.00) OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO EPAL.GG FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS FOR THE SERVICE.

To the extent that any claim, dispute or controversy regarding EPAL.GG or our Service isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and EPAL.GG both agree that any claim or dispute regarding EPAL.GG will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms.

12. **Arbitration**
-------------------

For any dispute you have with EPAL.GG, you agree to first [contact us](mailto:support@epal.gg) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address associated with your Account. If EPAL.GG has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court.

Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and EPAL.GG are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Business Account.

Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at www.adr.org. Unless you and EPAL.GG agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgement on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.

ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EPAL.GG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU. To the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding EPAL.GG or our Service isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise, you and EPAL.GG both agree that any claim or dispute regarding EPAL.GG will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 13 of these Terms.

13. **Governing** **Law and** **Jurisdiction**
----------------------------------------------

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is Los Angeles County, California or the United States District Court for the Central District of California and our dispute will be determined under California law.

**14\. Cookie Policy**

EPAL.GG uses certain technologies on its website to collect information that helps us improve your online experience. In this Cookie Policy, we refer to these technologies, which include cookies, pixels, web beacons, and gifs, collectively as “cookies.” This policy explains the different types of cookies used by EPAL.GG and how you can control them. We may change this Cookie Policy at any time so please take a look at the “last modified” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on the website. By agreeing to this Cookie Policy, by using the EPAL.GG website, you expressly consent to information handling practices and storage and access of cookies as described in this policy.

**What is a Cookie?**

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. They are widely used in order to make websites and software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).

**What Cookies do we use?**
---------------------------

Below we list the different types of cookies we may use on the Twitch Services.

**Essential Cookies** These cookies are essential to the operation of EPAL.GG in order to enable you to move around it and to use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as accessing secure areas of the website or paid for content, cannot be provided. These cookies are essential for using the website and therefore cannot be turned off without severely affecting your use of the website.

**Performance Cookies** Performance cookies, which often include analytics cookies, collect information about your use of this EPAL.GG website and enable us to improve the way it works. For example, performance cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the website, allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the EPAL.GG website, help us record any difficulties you have with the website and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.

**Functionality Cookies** In some circumstances, we may use functionality cookies. Functionality cookies allow us to remember the choices you make on the EPAL.GG website and to provide enhanced and more personalized features, such as customizing a certain webpage, remembering if we have asked you to participate in a promotion and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a blog. All of these features help us to improve your visit to the EPAL.GG website.

**Targeting or Advertising Cookies** We and our service providers may use targeting or advertising cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may use targeting or advertising cookies to limit the number of times you see the same ad on our website and to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.

These cookies remember what you have looked at on EPAL.GG and we may share this information with other organizations, such as advertisers.

**Flash Cookies** We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as “Flash cookies”) are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser. This means it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level, in the same way you would manage cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website directly. Please be aware that if you disable or reject Flash cookies for EPAL.GG, you may not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in.

**How do third parties use cookies on the site?**

In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide services on the EPAL.GG website. In addition, third-party advertisers and other organizations may use their own cookies to collect information about your activities on the EPAL.GG website and/or the advertisements you have clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed. Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.

We do not control these cookies. To disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third party’s website. For Extensions in particular, we encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail pages to review any privacy policy posted by the relevant developer, which may include additional information on their cookie practices. You can also learn more about controlling cookies in the “How do I control Cookies” section below.

**How do I control Cookies?**

You may refuse to accept cookies at any time by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse cookies.
