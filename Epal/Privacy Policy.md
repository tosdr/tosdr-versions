1\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
-----------------------------------

Personal information you disclose to us

In Short:  We collect personal information that you provide to us.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when registering at the Services or Apps, expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when participating in activities on the Services or Apps (such as posting messages in our online forums or entering competitions, contests or giveaways) or otherwise contacting us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services or Apps, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect can include the following:

EPAL, Inc. complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), applicable U.S. privacy legislation, and other international data protection laws. By agreeing to our Terms and Privacy Policy, users consent to the collection and use of their personal and biometric data, which may include facial recognition, fingerprinting, and voiceprints, for identity verification, security measures, and personalized user experiences. Users wishing to withdraw this consent may opt-out by contacting official channels with a written request. We are committed to processing all personal data, including biometric information, in accordance with the highest standards of legal compliance.

The facial data provided by you. Facial verification during login and registration is used for real-person checks and to prevent fraudulent attacks. This ensures that the platform services are used by the actual account holder, safeguarding user account and data security. We use the Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness service ([https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/face-liveness/?nc1=h\_ls](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/face-liveness/?nc1=h_ls)) for this purpose. All data will be securely stored on AWS, and neither the EPal platform nor the local app client will retain this data, guaranteeing no data leakage or loss.

The data abstracted from facial features will be stored during the validity of the platform account until the user deletes the platform account. Please note that this data will not be disclosed to reveal your personal privacy, such as inferring facial features or other private information. It will only be abstractly assigned a face ID alias for distinguishing different user entities.

Publicly Available Personal Information. We collect first name, maiden name, last name, and nickname; ID; current and former address; phone numbers; email addresses; business phone number; social media; and other similar data.

Personal Information Provided by You. We collect app usage; data collected from surveys; financial information (credit card number, purchase history, invoices); and other similar data.

Payment Data. We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), billing information and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is stored by Epal.gg.

Social Media Login Data. We may provide you with the option to register using social media account details, like your Facebook, Twitter or other social media account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect the Information described in the section called "HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS" below.

epal.gg may collect user chat data with AI ePal for the purpose of training AI ePal. This data includes user chat content, chat time, chat location, and other related information. epal.gg will use this data to enhance the performance of AI ePal, enabling it to provide a better quality of service.Users have the right to refuse or choose to authorize the collection of chat data. If users refuse authorization, epal.gg will not collect their chat data. If users choose to authorize, epal.gg will collect their chat data and use it in accordance with this privacy agreement.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
