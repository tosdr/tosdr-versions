### CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California’s “Shine the Light” law, and the California Online Privacy Protection Act provide consumers who are California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information.

Right to Information. Subject to certain limits, you may ask us to provide the following information for the 12-month period preceding your request:

1. The categories of Personal Information we collected about you;
2. The business or commercial purpose for collecting the Personal Information;
3. The categories of third parties with whom we shared the Personal Information;
4. If we disclosed Personal Information for a business purpose, a list of the disclosures including the
5. Personal Information categories that each category of recipient received; and

We do not provide these information rights for Personal Information that we obtain through a business-to-business (B2B) relationship. Right to Delete. You also have the right to ask us to delete any Personal Information that we have collected about you, subject to certain limitations under CCPA. We may deny your deletion request if the information is necessary for us or our service providers to, among other things, provide a good or service you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated in the context of our business relationship with you, perform a contract we have with you, detect and protect against security incidents or illegal activity, comply with a legal obligation, or exercise a right provided for by law.

* Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, the CCPA permits us to offer you certain financial incentives that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels, which are related to your Personal Information’s value. We do not currently offer financial incentives in exchange for Personal Information we collect.
