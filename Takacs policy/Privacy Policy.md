Privacy Policy
==============

Introduction
------------

These days the internet, email and no doubt social media as well, can provide us with powerful tools to help us in our work and to communicate efficiently. However, the drawbacks of the increased possibilities are not always immediately obvious to the user or they are known and ignored. Non governmental -- and other -- organisations and actors can, and do, gather information from email traffic and browser-server communication.

Policy Statement
----------------

The facilities available on the ecosystem of the takacs-policy.eu domain potentially enable me to acquire information about visitors to my site.

I DO NOT collect any information on visitors to this site.

[This site pledges not to track any visitors.](https://www.takacs-policy.eu/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt)

Furthermore, I will resist any legal efforts to garner information on my visitors, guests and friends to the maximum extent legally and practically possible.

Caution
-------

Whereas I do not spy on my guests, others may certainly do so.
