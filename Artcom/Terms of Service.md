III. Terms of Sale
------------------

These Terms of Sale apply to all offers made by Art.com Inc., all purchases and orders placed by you and all agreements concluded between us in relation to the products and services offered on this website.

  

### Return Rights

We are committed to quality products.

Within 45 days of receiving your order, you can return any art purchased on AllPosters for a full refund. We will cover all shipping and handling costs for valid returns of art that, in our sole discretion, are damaged, defective, or otherwise non-conforming upon delivery to you. You will be responsible for all shipping and handling costs for returns of art that are not, in our sole discretion, defective, damaged, or otherwise non-conforming. Your refund will be credited back to the original payment method you used to purchase your art. We will not refund you for returns received by us after 45 days from receipt of purchase. Any returns received by us outside of such 45-day window will be considered an “invalid return”. We may, in our sole discretion, re-deliver (at your sole cost and expense) or dispose of the art subject to an invalid return if not reclaimed by you within thirty (30) days from your invalid return.

  

### Pricing

Notwithstanding the product prices shown on the website, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items shown on the website may be mispriced as a result of price changes that are implemented at or about the time of your visit to the website. However, we do NOT charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process. If an item’s correct price is higher than our stated price, your sole recourse is cancellation of your order.

  

### Promotion Exclusions

\*Promotion applies to order total before shipping, taxes, and duties. Promotions that involve a price reduction may take a variety of forms, including strikethrough prices or a discount code (e.g., percent-off or dollar-off discount code) that is applied by the customer at checkout (collectively "Product Discounts"). Promotional offers may be used one time only per household. Only one discount or promotional offer may be used per item. "Bonus Discounts" that are automatically applied to your order total may not be combined with one-time use discount codes or gift codes. Discounts will not be applied to (a) previous or existing orders, (b) gift certificates, (c) Limited Editions, (d) Special Editions, (e) prices ending in.x5 and (f) prices marked as "Clearance".

  

### Acceptance of Order

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order. In such event your sole recourse shall be the return of amounts paid by you related to such order (if any).

  

### Sales Tax

Items shipped to destinations in the states of Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Ohio are subject to tax. No sales tax is charged when purchasing gift certificates; however, purchases paid for with gift certificates may be subject to tax.

  

### Product Descriptions

We attempt to describe our products offered as accurately as possible. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content of the website are 100% accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. If a product offered by us and purchased by you is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition for a conforming replacement, refund or credit.

  

### Disclaimer

We are not liable for any financial damage (including but not limited to the cost of any replacement purchase) that may occur because of non-timely arrival or any lack of availability or conformity of the product.

  

IV. Disputes
------------

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of Art.com, to purchases from Art.com, or to the sale of any products or services sold or distributed by Art.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

  

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Sale as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Art.com’s Registered Agent/Legal Department, located at 5188 W. 74th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46268. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Art.com and Allposters.com will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

  

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

  

### Applicable Law

By placing an order with Art.com, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and Conditions and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Art.com.

  

### Severability

If any of the terms or conditions herein shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term or condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term or condition.
