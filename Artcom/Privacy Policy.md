* Collected from another company within our family of companies
* Collected from an external third-party source
* Collected from another solution or asset
* Collected from other sources, when it is appropriate, to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our services, increase the appeal and relevance of advertising, and to prevent or detect fraud

Our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to support our business.

_Information provided directly by you or a member of your household_

When you interact with our online services, we may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we ask you to provide your name, contact details and payment details in order to purchase a printed product from us or to set up an online account, or your email address to sign up to receive a newsletter and/or to submit inquiries to us. We may ask for similar information when you contact us offline, for example for customer service.

The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

_Information collected from a device associated with you or your household_

When you use our online services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, browser type, the URL of the previous website you visited, your ISP, operating system and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our online services, including the pages accessed and links clicked.

Collecting this information enables us to better diagnose problems with our server and to administer our online services, as well as understand the visitors who use our online services, where they come from, and what content is of interest to them. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design, layout and functionality of the online services. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further on our '[Cookies and similar tracking technology](https://www.art.com/help/cookies)' page.

_Information We Collect from Another Company within Our Family of Companies_

_Information Collected from External Third-Party Sources_

We receive personal information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, prevent or detect fraud, and for other business purposes. We also receive information, such as device information and browsing information, from third parties for marketing purposes, for example, to provide you with personalized ads on Art.com and third-party websites and mobile services.

###   

What we do with your personal information
-----------------------------------------

We may use the information we collect through our online services for a number of purposes, including to:

* Performing services, including maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, processing payments, providing financing, providing analytics services, providing storage, or providing similar services

* To fulfill our legal functions or obligations

We may use sensitive personal information for each of the purposes described above and to make inferences about customers, which we may use to promote certain products or services.

###   

Who we disclose information to
------------------------------

We are careful to disclose your personal information in ways that respect your privacy and only as described in this Notice. We view you as a valued customer, not a product, and we do not sell or rent your personal information to others for money.

We may share and disclose your personal information to other third parties in the following circumstances:

* Within the Trends International. family of companies. When we do, the information will be used in ways that are consistent with this Notice.
* To vendors and other third-party service providers who require access to your personal information to assist in the provision of the online services, our products and services, and other business-related functions. For example, we partner with one or more credit card processing companies to assist us in processing your payment. We partner with third parties that offer credit checks services that review credit worthiness of certain users to manage our risk and help us to avoid sending out orders to users that cannot afford to pay. We may also work with third party service providers to assist us providing targeted email campaigns, assemble and prepare personalized offers and/or make particular product or purchase recommendations. However, those companies do not retain, disclose, store, or use personal information for any secondary purposes.
* We may also disclose your personal information to third parties: (a) where required by law or regulatory requirement, court order or other judicial authorization, (b) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purposes of meeting national security and law enforcement requirements; (c) in connection with the sale, transfer, merger, bankruptcy, restructuring or other reorganization of a business; (d) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property, or that of third parties; (e) to investigate any wrongdoing in connection with the online services or our services; (f) to protect the vital interests of an individual.
* To an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;
* Deidentified & Aggregated Personal Information: We continually strive to make customer shopping experiences more relevant and with less friction and may offer related services and insights to our suppliers and others. As a result, we may disclose to others insights that combine information from many customers in ways that do not directly identify you. For example, we may combine your shopping history with that of other customers to deliver generalized insights to our suppliers. These insights do not identify individual customers. This information helps our suppliers provide products and services relevant to our customers. We may receive payment for these insights.To deliver information about products and services that may be of interest to you, we may disclose information with other companies, such as publishers, advertisers and measurement analytics providers. For example, we may disclose device-related data (such as device identifier, type of device, IP address, cookies and other information associated with your browsing and app usage) and individual preferences and characteristics (such as insights and inferences related to shopping patterns and behaviors). This information does not identify you directly, but is necessary to personalize the advertisements you receive. We do not receive payment for this information. For more information about your choices related to advertising activities see "[Cookies and Similar Tracking Technology](https://www.art.com/help/cookies)".
* To any other person with your consent.

Like other e-commerce web sites, we use 'cookies' and other technologies to collect information and enhance features and functionality. Cookies are bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. They do allow us to do things like keep items in your shopping cart between visits or during the same visit or provide you with a more personalized user experience.

Whether you want your web browser to accept cookies or not is up to you. The 'Help' portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of features and services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your cart, proceed to checkout, or use any services that require you to sign in. If you have not changed your computer's settings, most likely your browser already accepts cookies.

They may collect information about your use of our online services, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services.
