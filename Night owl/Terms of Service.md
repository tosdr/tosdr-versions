Night Owl is not responsible for any personal damage, loss or theft related to the Product or to its use for any harm, whether physical or mental related thereto. Any and all claims or statements, whether written or verbal, by salespeople, retailers, dealers or distributors to the contrary are not authorized by Night Owl and do not affect this provision of this warranty.

#### Authorized Resellers (For purchasers of product after July 15th, 2019, the following additional terms apply)

Our policy is to offer product warranties and to perform services only on products purchased from an authorized Night Owl reseller and only accompanied by a receipt or proof of purchase. If you purchase a Night Owl product from an unauthorized 3rd party reseller, this Night Owl warranty will not be valid. For more information and a full list of Night Owl authorized resellers, please click [here](https://nightowlsp.com/night-owl-authorized-reseller).

Night Owl and authorized resellers deliver products that comply with the local regulatory requirements of, and are certified for use in, the country of purchase. If you purchase Night Owl products from an unauthorized 3rd party reseller, the products might not be suitable for use in your country.

### Technical Support Policy

Night Owl Security Products strives to help all of our customers have an excellent experience with our products and get the equipment operating as quickly as possible. In pursuit of this aim, we support our customers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week (24/7), and 365 days per year. This technical support is offered for the life of the product, which term shall be solely determined by Night Owl in its absolute discretion. We provide technical support to our customers in the following ways;

* via our website in the form of how-to videos, a searchable knowledge base, frequently asked questions and extensive technical data
* via email support
* via toll-free telephone technical support
* via remote access to your computer (upon your explicit request and authorization only)
* periodic software and firmware upgrades

Phone and/or email based technical support are only available in connection with Night Owl hardware and Night Owl software products during the Warranty Period for the applicable Night Owl hardware or software. The Warranty Period is set forth in the Warranty Policy accompanying your Night Owl hardware or software.

#### Availability:

Night Owl will provide technical support to only the registered customer, or an authorized representative of the customer. The registration information provided by the customer will be used to verify your identity. No other individual will be provided with technical support.

#### Proper use and scope of support:

Many of Night Owl’s product offerings have a networking component and extensive feature sets. Night Owl separates the types of technical support we offer and limits the extent of available support based upon criteria that we developed through review of customer experiences and our professional technical expertise.

Generally, customers should be able to test, set up, and install the Night Owl product by using the data and tools available on the Night Owl website. Support in the use of a product’s advanced features is supported exclusively via website how-to videos, knowledge base and FAQs. Our technical support specialists will not support or instruct customers on how to use or set-up advanced features.

With respect to the technical support, our goals are to (i) determine if an issue may require repair or replacement, (ii) aid in basic set-up of the product, and (iii) help customers synch their new Night Owl security product to their network and the internet for the purpose of computer or smart device-based viewing and/or control.

Phone support users should expect a polite, professional, and brisk walk through of the issue requiring support. Customers must have properly performed their own troubleshooting of the issues before calling, or the support technician will politely end the call. Proper preparation for a technical support call includes the following:

* the customer must be properly and accurately registered in our support system;
* DVR must be connected to your network/router via Ethernet connection on the DVR;
* must have brand name, model number, user name, and password for your wifi router;
* customer must be able to log into his/her own wifi router;
* must be calling from the product’s location;
* a monitor/TV must be plugged into the DVR;
* if the customer is attempting to access their DVR through a computer or smart device, the customer must have the computer or smart device available and the application downloaded and installed.

Night Owl Technical Support specialists are not equipped to and do not support other brands of security products, networking devices or software. Network and smart device-based internet connectivity can be complex. There are many potential issues that are heavily dependent on your unique network environment or strength of wireless signal. Our Technical Support specialists will briskly walk you through a troubleshooting process with the intention of getting the DVR on the internet and demonstrating the ability to view your cameras online. Once accomplished, your file will be noted as completed and support ticket closed.

#### Abuse of phone support:

Night Owl strives to provide high quality support and a positive experience during what many consider a frustrating activity. Our goal is to get you operating as quickly and efficiently as possible. As noted above, many of Night Owl’s products have a networking component or advanced features. Given our technical support goals, the following may be considered abuse:

* Abusive or foul language, or threatening behavior or language is not tolerated;
* Repeated use of phone support for network set up of the same model once it’s already been satisfied is not supported;
* Changes in customer’s network environment, 3rd party hardware, or other changes are not issues for Night Owl to remedy;
* Attempted use of phone support for ‘tutorials’ on advanced features that are supported via website is contrary to policy and will not be supported; or
* Calling without being first registered and properly prepared for a technical support call is contrary to policy and the call will be politely ended.

The above abuses of phone support will result in quick termination of the call and may result in permanent refusal of technical support services.

All communications including remote access sessions, emails, SMS and phone conversations are recorded for quality, training and assessment purposes. These are not accessible to customers.
