Our Terms and Privacy Policy
============================

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which [3rd Planet Techies](https://www.3ptechies.com/) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the https://www.3ptechies.com/ website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by the 3rd Planet Techies’ website.

Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.

#### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.
