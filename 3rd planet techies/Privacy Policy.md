Our Terms and Privacy Policy
============================

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which [3rd Planet Techies](https://www.3ptechies.com/) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the https://www.3ptechies.com/ website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by the 3rd Planet Techies’ website.

We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, place an order, subscribe to the newsletter, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site.

Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.

Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.

#### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

In a broader term: some of the links in our review contents are “affiliate links.” This means that if you click on the link and purchase the item(s) we recommend, We’ll receive an affiliate commission.
