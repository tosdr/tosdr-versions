In addition, the FCRA allows You to obtain a copy of all of the information in Your consumer credit file from consumer reporting agencies for a reasonable charge.

You are also entitled to receive a disclosure free of charge directly from the consumer reporting agency under the following circumstances:

• You have been denied credit, insurance or employment within the past sixty (60) days as a result of Your credit report.

• You certify in writing that You are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the sixty (60) day period beginning on the date on which You made the certification.

• You are a recipient of public welfare assistance.

• You have reason to believe that Your file at the credit reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud.

The FCRA permits You to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in Your credit file. Accurate information cannot be changed.

You do not have to purchase Your credit report or other information from Spokeo to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in Your Experian, Equifax and/or TransUnion file or to receive a copy of Your Experian, Equifax and/or TransUnion file.

If You reside in the States of Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Puerto Rico or Vermont, You may receive a free copy of Your consumer credit report once per year and if You are a resident of the State of Georgia You may receive two (2) copies per year.

b) To the extent permitted by law, You must commence any legal action (including an arbitration or lawsuit) within two years of the date of the event or facts giving rise to the dispute or You waive the right to pursue that claim.

b) The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability.

**23\. Dispute Resolution**

Please read this carefully. It affects Your rights.

a) Disputes Subject to Arbitration. Spokeo and You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between You and us, including, but not limited to:

• claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between You and us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;

• claims that arose before this or any prior agreement between us (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or disclosures); and

• claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement.

Despite this arbitration provision, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court, provided that it seeks relief that does not affect other customers and the action is not removed or appealed de novo to a court of general jurisdiction.

Only a court can decide the following:

• issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision,

• whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration,

• whether the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision,

• whether Section 23(b) has been complied with or violated for purposes of awarding relief under that Section that a court can award, and

• whether Sections 23(e), (f), or (g) have been complied with or violated.

These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of the agreement between us. **By agreeing to arbitrate, You and Spokeo both agree to waive the right to sue in court, to trial by jury, and to bring or participate in class actions.**

(b) Starting the Dispute-Resolution Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by U.S. mail or professional courier service, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Spokeo should be addressed to: General Counsel, Spokeo, Inc., 556 S. Fair Oaks Ave., Suite # 101-179, Pasadena, CA USA 91105 (“Notice Address”). The Notice to You will be sent by email to the address You provided with Your Account, if any, or by other reasonable means. The Notice must (i) state the claimant's name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and Account name (if any); (ii) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The Notice must be personally signed by You (if You are the claimant) or by a Spokeo representative (if we are the claimant). To safeguard your Account and protect Your privacy, you might be required to provide both your authentication and consent for us to discuss your Account or share your Account or other private information with anyone but you, including an attorney (“Authentication and Consent”).

Whoever sends the Notice must give the other party 60 days after receipt of a complete Notice (including Your Authentication and Consent, if required) to investigate the claim. During that period, either You or Spokeo may request an individualized discussion (by phone call or videoconference) regarding settlement (“Informal Settlement Conference”). You and Spokeo must work together in good faith to select a mutually agreeable time for the Informal Settlement Conference (which can be after the 60-day period). You and a Spokeo representative must personally participate, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Your and Spokeo's lawyers (if any) also can participate.

**Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled** for the claims and requested relief in the Notice during the “Informal Resolution Period.” The Informal Resolution Period is the number of days between the date that the complete Notice (and Authentication and Consent, if required) is received by the other party and the later of (i) 60 days later or (ii) the date the Informal Settlement Conference is completed, if timely requested.

Any arbitration proceeding cannot be commenced until after the Informal Resolution Period has ended. (Section 23(f) has additional requirements for commencing certain coordinated arbitrations.) All of the pre-arbitration dispute resolution requirements are essential so that You and Spokeo have a meaningful chance to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the AAA may not accept or administer such an arbitration nor assess or demand fees in connection with one. If the arbitration already is pending, it must be dismissed.

(c) Arbitration Procedures. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this arbitration provision. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this arbitration provision. The AAA Rules are available online at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/), or by writing to the Notice Address. The AAA shall administer the arbitration. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision, the arbitration will be administered by another arbitration provider that the parties agree to or that the court selects.

As in court, You and Spokeo agree that any counsel representing someone in arbitration certifies that they're complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including a certification that the claim or the relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under the AAA Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.

Unless Spokeo and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your residence at the time of the filing of the Demand. If You bring a claim for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.

Arbitrators may consider rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Spokeo users, but an arbitrator's ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different Spokeo users.

Unless the parties agree otherwise, You and we must bring all directly related claims in a single arbitration proceeding. If You or we later initiate a subsequent arbitration asserting claims that are directly related to ones that were raised in a prior arbitration between the same parties, the AAA or the arbitrator shall either (i) consolidate the subsequent arbitration with the earlier proceeding if it is ongoing or (ii) dismiss any claims raised in the subsequent arbitration that would be barred by applicable law if brought in court.

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as provided in Section 23(e), the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief that a court can award under applicable law. Although under some laws Spokeo may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Spokeo agrees that it will not seek such an award unless You are represented by an attorney and the arbitrator has determined that Your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

(d) Costs of Arbitration. Spokeo will pay all AAA filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees (“AAA Fees”) for any arbitration we initiate. Spokeo will also pay some or all of the AAA Fees for an arbitration that You initiate, so long as you have fully complied with the requirements of Section 23(b). First, if Your claims are valued at $1,000 or less (both to You and us), Spokeo will pay all AAA Fees. Second, if Your claims are valued at greater than $1,000 but less than $10,000, Spokeo will pay all AAA Fees in excess of $20. In such cases, Spokeo will pay its share of your filing fee directly to the AAA upon receiving a written request from You at the Notice Address or, if the AAA requires You to pay the filing fee to commence arbitration, Spokeo will send that amount to the AAA and request that the AAA reimburse you.

If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA Fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and You agree to reimburse us for any amounts we have paid on Your behalf to the AAA.

(e) Requirement of Individual Arbitration. YOU AND SPOKEO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR PARTICIPANT IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and Spokeo agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award, so long as the relief is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other Spokeo users. Neither You nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other Spokeo users. If (after exhaustion of all appeals) a court decides that any of this Section's limitations are unenforceable as to some aspect of the case, then all other aspects of the case must be arbitrated first. After completing arbitration, the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case will then be decided by a court.

(f) Administration of Coordinated Arbitrations. If 25 or more claimants submit Notices or seek to file arbitrations raising similar claims and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (whether such case are pursued simultaneously or not), all the cases must be resolved in staged proceedings. **You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of Your claim.** In the first stage, claimants’ counsel and Spokeo will each select up to 25 cases each (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and resolved individually by different arbitrators. If feasible, the arbitrators will be from the respective claimants’ home states. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed or proceed in arbitration, and the AAA must not assess or demand payment of fees for the remaining cases or administer or accept them.

The arbitrators are encouraged to resolve the cases within 120 days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties. After the first stage is completed, the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining cases, and Spokeo will pay the mediation fee. If the parties cannot agree how to resolve any of the remaining cases after mediation, they will repeat the process of selecting and filing up to 50 cases to be resolved individual by different arbitrators, followed by mediation.

If any cases remain after the second stage, the process will be repeated until all claims are resolved, with four differences. First, a total of 100 cases may be filed in the third and later stages. Second, the cases will be randomly selected. Third, arbitrators who decided cases in the first two stages may be appointed in later stages if different arbitrators are not available. Fourth, mediation is optional at the election of counsel for the claimants.

Between stages, counsel will meet and confer regarding ways to improve the efficiency of the staged proceedings, including whether to increase the number of cases filed in each stage. Either party may also negotiate with the AA regarding the amount or timing of AAA fees.

If this Section applies to a Notice, the Informal Resolution Period for the claims and relief set forth in that Notice will be extended (including the tolling of any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period for the claims and requested relief) until that Notice is selected for a staged proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court will have the authority to enforce this Section, including by enjoining the mass filing, the prosecution or administration of arbitrations, or the assessment or collection of AAA fees.

This Section and each of its requirements are intended to be severable from the rest of this arbitration provision. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court decides that the staging process in this Section is not enforceable, then the cases may be filed in arbitration and the payment of AAA Fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed rather than when arbitrations are initiated. fees.

(g) Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if Spokeo makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address, website links, or telephone numbers listed in this provision), You may reject any such change by sending us written notice via U.S. mail within 30 days of the first notice of the change to the Notice Address Above. Include Your name, address, phone number, account name, and a statement personally signed by You that You wish to reject the changes to the arbitration provision. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between You and Spokeo in accordance with the language of this arbitration provision.

(h) Forum Selection. Unless You and Spokeo agree otherwise, to the greatest extent permitted by law, the state and federal courts in Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes (except for disputes brought in small claims court) that are not subject to arbitration or over any action involving the applicability or enforceability of the arbitration provision or any of its parts. You and Spokeo consent to the jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or venue in those courts, or any other basis or right to seek to transfer or change venue to another court.

**24\. Entire Agreement**

a) These Terms and any Spokeo policies posted on Spokeo.com constitute the entire contract between You and Spokeo and supersede all previous written or oral contracts. Except as provided in Section (23)(e), if any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. Any failure by us to enforce any term of the Terms shall not affect our right to require performance at any subsequent time, nor shall the waiver by us of any breach by You of any provisions of these terms be taken to be a waiver of the provision or provisions itself.
