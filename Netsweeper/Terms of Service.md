EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE CLIENT ASSUMES ALL RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM.

13. **Limitation of Liability**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NETSWEEPER OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, OR ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION, DELIVERY OR LICENSING OF THE SYSTEM BE LIABLE TO THE CLIENT OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR, FOR EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR AGGRAVATED DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SYSTEM, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE POSSIBILITY OR CAUSE OF SUCH DAMAGES WAS KNOWN TO NETSWEEPER BEFOREHAND.

In the event Netsweeper is charged such taxes directly, Netsweeper may add the required tax amount (to comply with tax laws) to the Fees owed by the Client hereunder. Non-payment of invoice due constitutes adequate breach for the serial key to be disabled and/or deactivated by Netsweeper. Once payment has been received, the serial key will be reactivated after a system check has been conducted.

16. **Confidentiality and Non-disclosure**

Each Party agrees that it will not disclose to any third party any information concerning the customers, trade secrets, methods, processes or procedures, terms of this agreement or any other confidential, financial or business information of the other party without the prior written consent of the other party.

All information gathered in the course of service is the property of the Client and will only be used for client related purposes or for Netsweeper to improve its services. Each Party shall treat all Confidential Information received from the other in confidence and shall not use such Confidential Information, or disclose it to any third party, except as required by law (including applicable stock exchange rules and regulations) or insofar as strictly necessary for the performance of its obligations hereunder. This undertaking shall not apply to information lawfully received from a source other than the other Party.

Any Confidential Information supplied by one party to the other shall be governed by the following Terms & Conditions:

(i)      each party agrees to protect such Confidential Information with the same degree of care which it uses to protect its own like data and information;

(ii)    each party agrees that it shall not disclose to third parties in any manner or form, or otherwise publish such Confidential Information so long as it remains confidential without the explicit authorization of the other party; and

(iii)   each party agrees that it shall use such Confidential Information solely in connection with the performance of its obligations under these Terms & Conditions unless otherwise explicitly authorized by or on behalf of the other party.

Each party is responsible for ensuring that its employees and all other persons having access to the Confidential Information sign obligations of confidentiality equivalent to those contained in this clause. In the event that a party becomes aware of any breach of confidence by an employee or other person, it shall immediately notify the other party and give that party reasonable assistance in connection with any proceedings, which that party may institute against such person.

The obligations of Confidentiality herein will survive the cancellation or other termination of the Licence.

17. **Assignment**

The Client may not transfer or assign the Licence or its rights or obligations under these Terms & Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Netsweeper.

Netsweeper shall not be liable for any damages incurred by the Client as a result of such breach or failure, if such breach or failure to perform is caused by circumstances beyond the control of Netsweeper. Netsweeper shall be temporarily excused from performance hereunder by any such circumstances and shall use its best efforts to avoid, remove or cure such circumstances and shall resume performance with utmost dispatch when said circumstances are removed or cured. Netsweeper shall give prompt notice to the Client, claiming the circumstances which as an excuse for delay in performance.

20. **Miscellaneous and Applicable Law**

These Terms & Conditions are binding on the parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns. The invalidity of enforceability of any provision hereof will in no way affect the validity of enforceability of any other provision.

In the event of conflict between these Terms & Conditions and any of the Purchase Order, the EULA or the SLA, these Terms & Conditions shall govern.
