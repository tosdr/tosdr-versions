Permanently anonymized data does not constitute personally identifiable information and is therefore not traceable back to you. Permanently anonymized data may be exported to any country in or outside the European Union, USA or elsewhere. Within the US, both anonymization using HIPAA “Safe Harbor” and tokenization using an Expert Determination method may be used to anonymize data. For personal data collected in the EEA, GDPR-compliant anonymization methods are used.
