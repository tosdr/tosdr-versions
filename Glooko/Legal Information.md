    (c) the right to request erasure;

That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing that the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, upon request, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. Provision of such information will be subject to the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity. You can access your Service Data by logging into our Services and we may direct you there as a response to such request.

Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed.

    4. **Restricted Processing:** In some circumstances you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data.

    5. **Objection to Processing:** You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for any of the following: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
    8. **Complaints to a Supervisory Authority:** If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the country of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
    9. **Withdrawal of Consent:** To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
    10. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us. See Section 20 for contact details.
    
    2. **Third party websites**

    10. **Use of cookies.** To learn about our use of cookies, please see our policy located here: [https://glooko.com/cookie-policy/](https://glooko.com/cookie-policy/)
    11. **Location Service for Android Users**
    
    1.
