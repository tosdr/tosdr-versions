**Privacy Policy**
==================

The following is the QuickThoughts privacy policy for residents of the United States of America and is the policy of Dynata, LLC on behalf of itself and all members of the Dynata corporate family (collectively “Dynata”). All such entities globally shall have access to personal data collected pursuant to this policy.

**First Effective: August 15, 2013**

**This Version: Effective December 30, 2022**

The following sets forth the privacy policy for the Dynata,LLC online panel communities, the Dynata,LLC panel websites and/or the Dynata,LLC mobile applications (collectively "Application/Services") offered by Dynata.

This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection, use and disclosure of personal data or personally identifiable information ("**PII**") and other information by Dynata in connection with Dynata’s Services as defined herein and other Dynata and third party activities as defined herein ("Non-Research Activities"). Dynata’s Services provide you with the opportunity to join a panel, participate in surveys administered by Dynata or by third parties (whether as a panel member or a non-panel member), use the websites associated with the panels, use the Application/Services associated with the panels, and receive and redeem rewards and incentives, including, without limitation, sweepstakes entries, offered in connection with panel membership and/or the completion of surveys (collectively "**Services**"). Non-Research Activities include, but are not limited to, Dynata marketing Dynata Services and/or third parties marketing their services to you and/or sharing individual and/or aggregate profile data with third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models. Non-Research Activities are described in more detail in this Privacy Policy.

Your use of Dynata's Application/Services is completely voluntary and therefore Dynata's processing of your PII in connection with the Application/Services and Non-Research Activities and this Privacy Policy is with your consent.

Surveys administered by third parties and the data collected in connection therewith are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Registration with, use of, and access to Dynata's Services is subject to [Dynata's Terms and Conditions](https://www.quickthoughtsapp.com/terms). In most cases Dynata is not the sponsor of the survey and the survey instrument, and the survey results or survey data will be owned by the sponsor of the survey.

All references to "us" or "we" refer to Dynata. All PII is stored in the United States, where Dynata's servers are located and accessible globally to Dynata employees and/or agents. For purposes of this policy, respondent shall mean any individual who participates in Dynata Services, including passive data collection and/or participates in the Non-Research Activities described herein. For purposes of this policy, online shall include mobile web browsing,

**What personal data and other information does the Application/Services collect and how is it used?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynata collects personally identifiable information ("PII") from research participants during and after registration with a panel, including, without limitation, during participation in a survey and in connection with the receipt and redemption of rewards and incentives and/or during the Application/Services registration and download process.

In addition to the collection of PII mentioned above, during and subsequent to the registration process, you may be asked to voluntarily provide or disclose Sensitive Data. "**Sensitive Data**" means PII that discloses or reveals health and medical conditions, sexual orientation or sexual life, political opinions/views, race/ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs and trade-union membership. Sensitive Data is used to target survey opportunities to you and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

### **How does Dynata use the information it collects?**

Dynata's use of information:

In addition to the purposes described above, Dynata uses personal data collected through the Application/Services as follows: (i) to communicate with you regarding your membership with a survey panel(s) owned by Dynata; (ii) to communicate with you regarding your participation in a survey(s); (iii) to tailor survey opportunities to you and to arrange for advertisements to be displayed to you outside the Application/Services for the purposes of facilitating the completion of advertisement recall surveys; (iv) to send you notifications of survey opportunities; (v) to comply with any and all legal obligations, including, without limitation, tax obligations; (vi) to administer and manage Dynata's reward and incentive programs and fulfill your requests for rewards and incentives; (vii) to facilitate your entry into Dynata's sweepstakes and promotions and communicate with you regarding such entries; (viii) to update Dynata's records; (ix) to comply with any data suppression obligations or requirements; (x) for fraud detection and/or prevention purposes; (xi) to link your device and/or profile to additional information available about you and/or your device available from data management platforms ("DMP"); (xii) to market Dynata products/services to you; (xiii) to enable third parties to market their products/services to you; (xiv) to enable Dynata or third parties to develop marketing insights and/or audience/look alike models; (xv) to validate the profile information you provided to us; and/or (xvi) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this Policy or as otherwise authorized by you. Dynata may use information collected in the context of the Application/Services in connection with other survey panels that Dynata administers and/or in connection with Non-Research Activities. With respect to the linking of Application/Services data to third party DMP data, Dynata uses such data itself and/or permits Dynata's clients and/or the DMP itself to use such data to provide you with survey opportunities, to measure advertising effectiveness (as described in more detail below), to segment audiences; to design advertising campaigns using "look alike" cohort groups based on survey and third party data; and/or to market such third party's products/services to you.

Retargeting. Dynata may from time-to-time engage a third party or third parties to either display advertising on an Dynata website(s) or to manage Dynata's advertising on other websites (for example on social media sites). Dynata's third party partner(s) may use technologies such as cookies or identifying data elements. Including but not limited to your IDFA or Advertising ID to gather information about your activities on Dynata's website(s) and/or on other websites in order to: (i) provide you with advertising about Dynata and its services and/or (ii) assist Dynata in developing marketing and advertising campaigns designed to target individuals who have a social and demographic profile similar to your social and demographic profile. If Dynata is conducting a re-targeting program and you wish to not participate in this re-targeting program, please opt-out via the applicable cookie opt-out process set forth in this Privacy Policy or in Dynata's separate cookie notice, by modifying your IDFA or Advertising ID and/or by unsubscribing within the advertisement itself.

Audience Insights/Look-alikes. Dynata and/or third parties may use Personal Data and/or may link Personal Data to a third-party cookie to develop audience insights and/or look-alike models in connection with marketing campaigns.

Online Advertising Effectiveness. In connection with Dynata's online ad effectiveness program, you can participate in surveys regarding ads, promotions, content, campaigns, and/or websites that Dynata is testing for its clients. To facilitate the completion of these surveys, Dynata's clients may write, set, or read cookies, locally shared/stored objects, flash cookies and/or any other related technology (each a "**Third Party Technology**" and collectively the "**Third Party Technologies**"). The Third Party Technologies may be written, set or read in various locations, including, without limitation, Dynata's servers or systems. If you participate, your UID will be stored in or associated with the Third Party Technology to allow you to be re-contacted about the online ad or promotion and Dynata's client will use the Third Party Technology to determine whether you have seen, clicked on, or otherwise interacted with the online ad or promotion. If you have interacted with the online ad or promotion, Dynata's client will send your UID and the specific survey to Dynata and Dynata will provide you with the opportunity to complete the survey.

Audience Measurement Data. In addition to the use and sharing of Audience Measurement Data (as defined below) in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, as such research is described above, Dynata may share your UID and data previously collected by Dynata, including, without limitation, age, gender, income, number of people in your household, education/education level, and employment status, ("**Audience Measurement Data**"), to third parties, including, without limitation, Dynata's subcontractors, partners, and/or clients for the purpose of audience measurement reporting on the content, advertisements, campaigns, and websites that you visit, view, and/or click on. The Audience Measurement Data will be used in connection with online advertising effectiveness research, and to assist in the creation, development, and implementation of websites, online advertisements, and other Internet and digital media features, functionality, and campaigns. Audience Measurement Data may be shared in a single summary form (i.e. individual respondent level) or aggregate summary form (i.e. group of respondents).

### **How do advertisers/ad networks use my information?**

Ad partners' use of information.

You can use the Application/Services to participate in surveys, including, without limitation, surveys regarding specific ads and promotions that Dynata is testing for its business clients. You may see these ads or promotions in several places, including, without limitation, in non-Dynata mobile apps (for example, in a gaming app), after which Dynata shall provide you with access to, or contact you to complete, a survey about the ad or promotion that you were exposed to. To facilitate the completion of surveys on ads or promotions, Dynata has partnered with ad companies that provide, measure or facilitate advertisements, including, without limitation, in many other mobile apps. The Application/Services provides these ad networks with the UID, your unique device identifier, and many or all of the other types of information described in the "Information collected through automated means" section above (including your ongoing geolocation, if your device permits the collection of geolocation). Then, when you use a mobile app that has partnered with one of the ad companies, the ad company can use your unique device identifier or other automatically collected information to recognize your device. The ad company may then show you an ad or promotion that Dynata is testing for one of our business clients. The ad company may then inform Dynata that the device associated with your UID has just received an ad or promotion, which allows Dynata to provide you with access to, or to contact you to complete, a survey regarding the ad or promotion. With your consent, the ad companies also use the information they collect about your device and your interactions with the Application/Services and other mobile apps to provide you with other in-app advertising that has been tailored to your interests and for other purposes. To learn more about some of these ad companies, including how to opt out, please visit the following:

### **What communications will I receive through the Application/Services or relating to the Services?**

Dynata may contact you to participate in surveys via "push" notifications or SMS/text messages if you expressly agree to receive such communications.

In addition, Dynata and/or its agents or vendors on behalf of Dynata will send email communications to you regarding survey invitations, survey participation, reward or incentive information, inquiries and redemption, newsletters, notices required to be provided hereunder or by law, sweepstakes or promotion entries, notice of winning a sweepstakes or promotion, and in response to inquiries from you.

For a list of the subcontractors acting as data controllers or data owners of your data and their privacy policies, please click [here](https://www.rnssiprivacy.com/data-controllers/).

(vi) To a client for limited market research related uses including, without limitation, modeling, validation, data append, database segmentation, and reward, incentive, or sweepstakes redemption, fulfillment, and/or entry;

(vii) In connection with a change of ownership or control, including, without limitation, a merger or an acquisition of any or all of Dynata's business assets, provided that the party receiving or acquiring the personal data agrees to use, protect, and maintain the security, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data in accordance with this Policy;

(viii) to a client or to such client's customer in the event Dynata or a third party believes that you have or may violate the intellectual property rights of a third party;

(x) to a third party, which shall include both Dynata research clients and third parties that engage in Non-Research Activities; and

In addition to the foregoing, if you enroll through a third party with whom Dynata has a contractual relationship and/or from an email sent from a third party company proposing you to join our Application/Services (collectively "Program Partner"), Dynata may share select enrollment information with the Program Partner who invited you into the program, which can include your full name, post or zip code, and your email address. You acknowledge that our Program Partner may collect, use, and disclose that information in accordance with their privacy policy. Please note that Dynata will not be responsible for and will not be liable for our Program Partner's actions concerning your information or for any Program Partner's privacy practices when you are dealing directly with them.

Please note, Dynata may allow a client to collect PII directly from respondents. The disclosure is voluntary and, prior to collection, the client is required to enter into a written agreement with Dynata, which, among other things, limits use of the PII.

Dynata may license certain PII to third parties (e.g., data brokers, data aggregators, etc.) for their own Non-Research Purposes, including, without limitation, the licensing of individual-level and/or aggregated-level data (e.g., product and/or service purchasing or usage activity, social media activity, website visitation data, internet search history, etc.) for the development of audience insights and/or look-alike models, for the purpose of sale of such data to the third party's clients/customers for the purpose of performing analytics and providing marketing intelligence and/or to enable such third party to market its products/services to you.

Additionally, UIDs and information collected by automated means are provided to third parties, including, without limitation, clients, partners, agents and/or vendor for the purposes of identifying respondents for re-contact surveys or communications, fraud detection and/or prevention, database matching, data validation, data append, coding, data segmentation, and reward, incentive, and/or sweepstakes or promotion related services.

In connection with your survey data, Dynata or the client may associate certain demographic attributes to you. Dynata may share with third parties, including but not limited to clients, the geographic and/or demographic data Dynata collects from you during enrolment or through certain profile questions Dynata may ask you. Such data may be shared with third parties on an individual respondent level or aggregate summary form (i.e. a group of respondents). If you voluntarily disclose personal data in connection with your survey data and responses, and Dynata collects the survey data and responses, Dynata will transfer the survey data and responses, UID and the voluntarily disclosed personal data to the relevant Dynata client.
