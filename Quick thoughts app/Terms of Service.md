#### 21\. Severability

If any term or provision of these Terms shall be held or declared to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such term or provision shall be deemed null and void and shall not affect the application and/or interpretation of these Terms. The remaining terms or provisions of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect, as if the invalid or unenforceable term or provision was not a part of these Terms.

#### 22\. Arbitration Agreement (United States only)

All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms, use of any product or service provided by Dynata, or related to the processing of personal data, that cannot be resolved informally or on an individual basis in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Section 22 (this “**Arbitration Agreement**”). Unless otherwise agreed, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Dynata, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.  
  
Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“**Notice**”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Dynata should be sent to: 4 Research Drive, Suite 300, Shelton, Connecticut 06484 USA; ATTN: Arbitration Notice. After the Notice is received, you and Dynata may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Dynata do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.  
  
Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“**JAMS**”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“**ADR Provider**”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules (the “**JAMS Rules**”) governing the arbitration are available online at https://www.jamsadr.com/. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.  
  
If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.  
  
If you or Dynata pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.  
  
If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Dynata, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim (including any claim regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement or any unconscionability in connection with these Terms). The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Dynata.  
  
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dynata in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.  
  
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  
  
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable with regards to any particular subject matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect with regard to such specific subject matter and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  
  
Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.  
  
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Dynata.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Dynata may bring an individual action in small claims court.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  
  
In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA for such purpose.

#### 23\. Governing Laws; Jurisdiction and Venue

These Terms and your access to, use of or participation in the Applications/Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Connecticut, USA, without regard to any portion of any choice of law principles (whether those of Connecticut or any other jurisdiction) that might provide for application of a different jurisdiction’s laws. All claims or disputes arising in connection with these Terms and/or your access to, use of or participation in the Applications/Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or Federal courts located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, USA.

#### 24\. Miscellaneous Terms

The headings contained in these Terms are for reference only and shall have no effect on the interpretation and/or application of these Terms. Dynata’s failure to enforce a breach by you of these Terms shall not waive or release you from such breach and shall not waive, release or prevent Dynata from enforcing any subsequent breach by you of these Terms. These Terms and any rules, terms or policies referenced herein or incorporated herein, and any Panel-specific requirements, represent the entire understanding and agreement between Dynata and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.
