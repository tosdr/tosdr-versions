#### ADWAYS PRIVACY POLICY

#### Adways is an advertising marketplace that proposes innovative advertising solutions to website and/or content publishers (the “**Publishers**”), as well as advertisers and/or their intermediaries such as media agencies (the “**Advertisers**”) all over Europe, USA, Latin America and Asia.

#### Publishers use Adways advertising solutions to monetize their ad spaces either directly or through Adways advertising demand including other advertising buyer partners.

#### Advertisers or their intermediaries (eg. media agencies) display their advertising campaigns through Adways advertising solutions on the websites or apps of our publisher partners.

#### Adways advertising technology collects and uses data to help make online advertising more relevant as well as for ad delivery and reporting purposes. Our ads are placed contextually as an overlay or around video editorial contents to be more relevant for you than standard advertising you would receive otherwise.

#### In the context of the implementation of our advertising solutions, the data we collect may include some of your personal date, the process of which is detailed herein.

#### **Scope of this privacy policy**

#### Adways SAS, together with its affiliates (“Adways”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) recognizes the importance of privacy and is committed to providing transparency and control over the use of the data in online advertising.

#### We collect and process your personal data in compliance with the French law N° 78-17 dated 6th January 1978 on Information Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberties (the “**French Data Protection Act**”), as well as the regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (the “**GDPR**”).

#### This privacy policy details Adways data practices on how we collect, use, process and share the data we may collect through our advertising services as well as the ways in which individuals may exercise control over the use of information collected by us.

#### We do not collect or process information related to (i) name, user address, place of work, date of birth, email address, or phone number (ii) hardware-based identifiers such as UDID or MAC Address and (iii) sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health…).

#### We do not create segments to specifically target children under 16 years old.

#### **Cookie-based identification**

#### In order to deliver personalized ads as well as non-personalized ads, Adways uses the Cookie-based identification method to single out users.

#### **3\. Data use**

#### **Analytics:** We use collected data for monitoring and reporting the campaign delivery for Advertisers and Publishers and for internal business analysis.

#### **Delivery Algorithm training:** We use collected data in order to improve our service and technology.

#### Such requirements arise from our agreements concluded with Advisers and Publishers, under which the same ads must not be displayed to the same users and are subject to statistical reporting. We therefore use the data we collect on the legal basis of our legitimate interest resulting from the fulfillment of our contract obligations.

#### **4. Recipients of the data we collect**

#### **5\. Data collection and processing by our partners**

#### Your personal data will not be exchanged with, transferred or rented to any third party.

#### In particular, our partners, including those acting as “Programmatic Buyers” that use Demand Side Platforms for purposes of purchasing our ad placements through programmatic auctions ad, directly collect your data and are solely responsible, as data controllers, of their processing in order to deliver their ads on Adways network.

#### If you do not want us to use your IP to count the number of times you have seen the same ad, please follow the instructions below.

#### **To opt-out from your web browser**

#### If you opt-out, you will still see ads, but not capped; we will not be able to control the frequency of occurrence of a given ad.
