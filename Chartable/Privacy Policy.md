Chartable Holding, LLC, an affiliate of Spotify (“Chartable,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to treating the personal data we process with respect and sensitivity. We want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) aims to explain what we mean in further detail below.

1\. About this Policy

This Policy sets out the essential details relating to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal data you use the website, Chartable’s platform (the “**Platform**”), and any other products and services that link to this Policy (collectively, the "**Services**").

In this policy we describe our personal data processing activities for the following types of data subjects:

* Individuals at content publishers who use the Platform to use our analytics services (“**Platform Users**”)
* Consumers who visit websites owned and operated by us (“**Website visitors**”)
* Listeners of the podcasts produced by content publishers who work with us to measure the effectiveness of advertising in their podcasts (“**Listeners**”)

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.

This policy is not…

* the Chartable [Terms of Service](https://chartable.com/terms), which is a separate document. The [Terms of Service](https://chartable.com/terms) outline the legal contract between you and Chartable for using the Chartable Platform.
* About your use of other services offered by Chartable affiliates which have their own privacy policy, such as the Spotify service, Anchor, Megaphone, Podsights, Soundtrap, and Spotify Live.

8\. Data Security

We are committed to protecting the personal data in our systems.

We have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.

Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify’s legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:

* maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
* making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
* complying with our legal obligations
* resolving disputes

When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of information, the nature and length of our relationship with you, the impact on such relationship if data is deleted, mandatory retention periods provided by law or statute of limitations.

10\. International Transfers

Because of the global nature of our business, we share personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:

* make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
* help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live
