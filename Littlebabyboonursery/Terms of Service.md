1.2. We are placing legal conditions on Your use of this Website.

1.3. Our first condition is that You must agree to all of the conditions in this Agreement.

1.6. Party Definitions and Introductory Terms.

1.6.1. “We” or “Us,” means the service provider of the above referenced website(s) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Website” or “Site”) and related services, which include uploading and downloading data and content to the Site and telephonic and electronic communication with others through our Site (“Services”). When this Agreement uses first-person pronouns such as “Us,” “We,” “Our,” “Ours,” etc., those first-person pronouns are referring to the Website.

1.6.2. “You,” the User. As a User of this Website, this Agreement will hereinafter refer to the User as “You” or through any second-person pronouns, such as “Yours,” etc. Hereinafter, the User of the Website shall be referred to in applicable second-person pronouns.

1.7. Consideration.

Consideration for Your knowing agreement to all of the provisions in this Agreement has been provided to You by allowing You to use Our Website and Our Services. You agree that such Consideration is adequate, and that it is received upon Your viewing, accessing or downloading any portion of Our Website or by participation as a Client.

1.8. Revisions to this Agreement.

1.8.1. From time to time, We may revise this Agreement. We reserve the right to do so, and You specifically agree that We have this unilateral right. You agree that all modifications or changes to this Agreement are in force immediately upon posting. The updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect. To the extent any amendment of this Agreement is deemed ineffective or invalid by any court, the parties intend that the prior, effective version of this Agreement be considered valid and enforceable to the fullest extent.

1.8.2. If We change anything in this Agreement, We will change the “Last Modified Date” at the top of this Agreement.

You agree to periodically re-visit this web page, and to use the “Refresh” button on Your browser when doing so. Upon each visit, You agree to note the date of the last revision to this Agreement. If the “Last Modified Date” remains unchanged from the last time You reviewed this Agreement, then You may presume that nothing in the Agreement has been changed since the last time You read it. If the “Last Modified Date” has changed, then You can be certain that something in the Agreement has been changed, and You agree that You will again review the Agreement in its entirety and that You will agree to its terms or immediately cease use of the Website. Your continued Use of the Website, after any such revision, shall be deemed to be Your acceptance of all revisions.

1.8.3. Waiver. If You fail to re-review this Agreement as required to determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all responsibility for such omissions and You agree that such failure amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended Agreement. We are not responsible for Your neglect of Your legal rights.

1.8.4. Although this User Agreement represents the primary terms and conditions of service for the Site, additional guidelines and rules are hereby incorporated by reference. The documents which can be found on Our Site and which are specifically incorporated by reference, and are therefore part and parcel of this Agreement are the following:
