If you create an account with SCAM DETECTOR for any reason, we may use your name or your email address as your login name.

### 4\. USE OF THE SERVICES

In accessing and using the Services, files and other content might be uploaded or created, and other usagerelated data can be created, collected, and processed.

All the information you upload to the Services are stored on an appropriate server infrastructure for processing. Data is typically stored on your mobile device and synced with Amazon Web Services. For any files we keep, we keep them for the sole purpose of giving you and your designated third parties access to the files and data for as long as you need them. During that time, we may view that data to, for example, troubleshoot problems, or to gather anonymized user data.

The legal basis of the processing is your consent.

### 5\. USE OF OUR OWN INTERNET COOKIES

We use cookies on the website. These are small files that your browser automatically creates and displays on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you access the Services. Cookies do not harm your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans, or other malicious software. Cookie information is stored, and may result in a connection with a specific terminal or browser being used. This does not, however, mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. The use of cookies serves to increase the usability of the Services. For example, we use session cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages, or that you have completed certain tasks or reached certain goals. These are automatically deleted after leaving the Services. In addition, to improve usability, we also use temporary cookies that are stored on your device for a specified period of time, typically 30 days. If you access the Services again, it will automatically recognize that you have already been with us and what inputs and settings you have made, so you do not have to re-enter them. We also use cookies to statistically record the use of the Services, and to evaluate that use for the purpose of optimizing the Services. These cookies allow us to automatically recognize that you have already been with us when you once again access the Services. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined time. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or always provide a hint appearing before a new cookie is created. However, disabling cookies completely may mean that you cannot use all features of the Services.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some features of the Services may not work properly without cookies. To learn more about cookies generally, visit www.allaboutcookies.org and http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN.

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a User does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s User. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to browser DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. You also can typically remove and reject Cookies or Local Storage from the Services with your browser settings. Many browsers are set to accept Cookies and Local Storage until you change your settings. If you remove or reject Cookies or Local Storage, it could affect how the Services work for you. In all circumstances, we may perform the foregoing information collection practices directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf. Also, if you access the Website or the Services from a social networking service, we may share information with such social networking service in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to the extent permitted by your agreement with such social networking service and its privacy settings. We may also use other technologies such as Local Storage and Pixel Tags. “Local Storage” is an industry standard technology that allows a website or application to store and retrieve data on a person’s computer, mobile phone or other device.

We may use device, caching or other forms of Local Storage to store your preferences, help us remember certain information about how you interact with the Services or display content on the through the Services based upon what you have viewed on various other websites. We may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with the Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is ordinarily not visible to you and may be associated with Cookies on your hard drive or Local Storage. Pixel Tags allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages or parts of the Services, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. In addition, we may from time-to-time work with third-party companies, including advertisers, that use Cookies, Local Storage and other tracking technologies to collect non-identifying information about your activities on the Website or the Services in order to help us better understand the use and operation of the Website and the Services. These third parties may collect and analyze information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you access or use the Services. We do not exercise control over these third-party websites or services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services you use. By accepting this Privacy Policy, and by accessing or using the Website or the Services, you are consenting to permit the use of Cookies, Local Storage and Pixel Tags by us and the third-party companies with which we work.

### REASONS FOR USING COOKIE-RELATED TECHNOLOGY

Some cookies are required for the Services to operate. Other cookies enable us to track your interests, to enhance your experience while using the Services, or to target advertising.

The types of cookies used in the Services and why they are used is as follows:

• “Strictly necessary” cookies are required to allow us to deliver the Services to you.  
• “Performance” or “Analytics” cookies help us to collect information about how Users interact with the Services and help us analyze and improve the Services. Performance or analytics cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser until you delete them.  
• “Advertising” cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They help to display advertisements that are based on your inferred interests, prevent the same ad from appearing too often and ensure that ads are properly displayed.

By using our cookies, we want to optimize your experience while using the Services. These Services are based on our aforementioned legitimate interests, which at the same time represents the legal basis for the data processing described here.

### 6\. USE OF ANALYTICS AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES

We may use web analytics and other services for the continuous optimization of the Services. The tracking provides a statistically accurate record of the use of the Services and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimizing our offerings. From time to time, we employ a variety of data processing and collection services and tools to help us provide you with the best services available. For example, we may use Google Analytics. Note that the list may change from time to time and is provided solely as examples of how we collect data. The legal basis for the data processing described in this section is our authorized interest in the needs-based design and continuous optimization of the Services.

The web analytics and third-party services referred to herein is transmitted to a server with Amazon Web Services and stored there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the Services, to compile reports on user activity and to provide other services for the purposes of market research and tailor-made design of Services. This information may also be transferred to third parties if required by law or if third parties process this data in the order.

You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your software accordingly; however, if you limit or prevent the installation of cookies, some features of the Services may not be fully function, or function at all. You can prevent the collection by analytics data by opting out of the collection of such data. In that case, an opt-out cookie will be set which will prevent the future collection of your data when you access the Services. If you delete your cookies, you must reset the opt-out cookie again.

### 7\. SOCIAL MEDIA PLUG-INS

We may use Social Plug-ins in the Services from, for example, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to increase awareness of the Services, and for promotional purposes. We are not responsible for activity or content found on those (and any other) third-party sites. Please note that a link to a third-party website or service does not mean that we have reviewed or endorsed its privacy practices. If you visit a third-party website or service, you are subject to its privacy practices and policies, not ours. This privacy policy does not apply to any personal information that you provide to these other websites and services.

### 8\. SERVER LOCATION

SCAM DETECTOR operates using Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) servers on which user data is collected, stored, and used. By using the App, you consent to the transmission of your data to the AWS. Amazon Web Services, Inc. is located in the United States. Accordingly, your personal information may be stored in or accessed from multiple countries, including the United States. Whenever AWS transfers personal information to other jurisdictions, AWS will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with their Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws. Moreover, SCAM DETECTOR, through AWS, may use a legal mechanism known as “standard contractual clauses” to protect information transferred outside the EU and the UK. Standard contractual clauses refer to contracts between companies transferring personal information that contain standard commitments approved by the EU Commission protecting the privacy and security of the information transferred.

If you have questions, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.scam-detector.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

This section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA.” For more details about the personal information, we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see Section 2 above, titled “General collection, processing and use of personal data in the context of the use of the App,” along with relevant other sections. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described above (as such term is defined in the CCPA) the personal information we collect. We do not sell your personal information; and will not sell your personal information without providing you the ability to opt out. Please note that we do use third-party cookies for our advertising purposes as further described above.

Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” of their personal information that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.

We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email address. Government identification may be required. Consumers can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf.

Please note:

• We may not honor part or all of a request you make to exercise your rights under CCPA – for example, certain information we collect is exempt from this California Privacy Notice, such as publicly-available information collected from a government agency. When this occurs and we do not honor your request, we will explain why in our response.

• You have the right to request information about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, as well as the categories of sources used to collect the information, the purpose for collecting such information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share such information.  
• We do not sell your personal information, and will not sell your personal information without providing you the ability to opt out. You have the right to request information about our disclosure for business purposes of your Personal Information to third parties.
