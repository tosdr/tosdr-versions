AniDB Policies
==============

[Download (Do **NOT** click!)](https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=zusetztaocqqcwef)

AniDB Policies: General Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

  

These General Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy (collectively, our "Policy" or "Policies") govern the conditions for using the anidb.net Websites ("Website", "Site"), and the manner in which AniDB ("We", "Us", "Our") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from Users (each a "User", or collectively as "Users") of the Website. By continuing to use AniDB, you acknowledge that you accept our Policies, which may be updated from time to time. AniDB reserves the right to update its Policies at any time, without notice.

  

**AniDB** stands for "**Ani**me **D**ata**B**ase". We are a not-for-profit organization that features detailed information about all forms of **CJK** (**C**hinese, **J**apanese, and **K**orean) animation. We also offer a public forum for our users to discuss anime.  
  
This Policy document serves as our **General** Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and is not an exhaustive list. AniDB reserves the right to moderate the use of our services as we deem appropriate and necessary.

  

To solve some common misconceptions about AniDB:

  

* AniDB website and AniDB's IRC channels do **not** host any files for download, and they do **not** link to any files for download, notwithstanding the following exception:
    * From time to time, we may host client software for Users to download, such as an "API client", which allow the User to interact with AniDB without the use of a web browser.
* Offering to share files or direct links to files, in the forum or on our IRC channels, will generally get you banned, as will requesting other Users to provide such files to you. Our staff have full discretion in applying and moderating these rules.
    * Our Forum Rules can be found here: [https://anidb.net/forum/thread/10096](https://anidb.net/forum/thread/10096)
* Please refer to the Policy section below, entitled **Third-Party Websites and Content**, in cases where AniDB provides a link to external websites.
* Please refer to the Policy section below, entitled **Contacting Us**, should you need to contact AniDB.
* AniDB is a public anime database; anyone can register as a User, and add new information to the database or modify existing information in the database. In general, database entries are not verified or vetted by AniDB staff members before they are inserted into the DB. As such, AniDB expressly cannot guarantee the validity of any entries in our database, and _AniDB cannot be held responsible for the content of the database entries_. While AniDB does not guarantee the validity of entries in our database, we do periodically undertake a "best-effort" random review of database entries. Should you see an error in any of the database entries on AniDB, you may submit a change request to make an edit.

  

We reserve the right to block a User from accessing portions of our Website, up to and including the entire Website, at any time and without notice, for violating our General Terms of Service or for any other reason, as we deem appropriate.

Licensing
---------

  

**CC-BY-NC-SA License:** Content on AniDB is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-NC-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). **In other words, you cannot use AniDB data as part of a for-profit operation: no ads, subscriptions, paid downloads, sale of merchandise, or other for-profit revenue streams**.

  

**"Fair Use"/"Fair Dealing":** We do not own the copyright of any images displayed on AniDB. Images are displayed under the "fair use" or "fair dealing" concept found in many countries' applicable legislation. For AniDB purposes, to meet the "purpose and character of use" test, images are displayed in a non-commercial nature for not-for-profit educational purposes; we display images on our website to educate readers on various anime that exist in the world, and we do not charge a fee.

  

**No scraping:** Additionally, you may not scrape the AniDB database, and we do not offer database dumps or bulk export access to the database.

  

[![](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

  

**In other words:** If you make use of AniDB data, such as creating a service or an app that accesses our API, or redistributing our content in another form, you are agreeing to abide by the terms of the CC-BY-NC-SA License, as well as our Policies regarding use of AniDB Data. Additional terms may apply.

  

### Accessing AniDB Data

:  

**What you may do**: You can access AniDB data via all of our supported channels, including:

  

* For users: you can use the website to browse the complete dataset.
* For users: you can export your personal MyList using the supported export tools.
* For bots, scripts, and other automated methods: you can use our [API](https://wiki.anidb.net/w/API) services to access a subset of the database.
    
    This list is non-exhaustive.
    

  

**What you may NOT do**: You cannot scrape the HTML page, the database, or attempt to make a copy of the database:

  

* You cannot scrape the HTML web pages under any circumstances.
    * You cannot scrape the HTML web pages using bots, scripts, or other automated methods.
    * For further clarity, you also cannot scrape the HTML web pages using manual methods.
* You cannot scrape the API under any circumstances.
    * You cannot scrape the API using bots, scripts, or other automated methods.
    * For further clarity, you also cannot scrape the API using manual methods.
* You cannot abuse the export tool.
    
    This list is non-exhaustive.
    

  

Use some common sense and apply the spirit of our TOS; AniDB data cannot be extracted in bulk, and database dumps are not offered. Use AniDB via our website (for humans only!) or via our API (for bots and scripts). Don't flood the API, scrape the API, or scrape the website. When in doubt, please Contact Us on IRC.

  
  

### Using AniDB Data

:  
**What you may do**: Your service may accept donations, but only to cover operating costs. Examples of operating costs include: server hosting, DNS registration, etc. Donations cannot be used as an avenue for profit (see below).  
**What you may NOT do**: Your service cannot require payment, it cannot generate revenue, and it cannot be a for-profit or commercial venture. For example:  

* You cannot require payment to download your app.
* You cannot require users to pay for a subscription.
* You cannot use display ads.
* You cannot sell user data.
* You cannot offer paid services, features, or products, regardless of the payment model ("pay-per-use", "freemium", "subscription", "one-time purchase", etc).
* You cannot (re-)sell AniDB data.
    
    This list is non-exhaustive.
    

Use some common sense and apply the spirit of our TOS; AniDB data cannot be used in a venture with the view or motive of profit. When in doubt, please Contact Us on IRC.

The User's web browser stores these cookies on the local storage of the User's device, for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. The User may choose, at their own discretion, to configure their own web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert the User when cookies are being sent. If the User does so, some parts of the Website may not function properly.

  
  

### How We Use Collected Information

  

AniDB may collect and use the personal information of our Users for various purposes, including, but not limited to, the following:

  

* _To register you as a User:_
    
    We require basic personal User information, such as a username and an email address, to create an account for a registered User.
    
* _To run and operate our Website:_
    
    We may need User information to display content on the Website correctly.

### How We Protect Your Information

  

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, and destruction of your personal information stored on our Website. This includes, but is not limited to, the following User information: Username, Password, Email Address, other personal identification information that is optional to registration, optional User-generated transaction information, User-generated content.

  
  

### Sharing Your Personal Information

  

We do not sell, trade, or rent the personally identifiable information of Users to other parties. We may share generic and/or anonymized, aggregated demographic information with other Users of the Website via the Website's APIs, graphs, charts, or infographics; such information is not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and Users.

  
  

### Third-Party Websites and Content

  

Users may find content on our Website that links to the external websites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these external sites, and are not responsible for the practices employed by external websites linked to or from our Website. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own terms of service privacy policies. Browsing, interacting with, or using any other external website, including websites which have a link to or from our Website, is subject to that external website's own terms and policies. AniDB is not responsible for the content and services of external, third-party websites or services.

  
  

### Removal of Your Account

  

As required by Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), AniDB will remove your account if you so desire. Using the email address associated with your AniDB account, please send us an email addressed to **info@anidb.net** and state that you want your account removed. Please note that if there are multiple accounts associated with that email address, we will remove **all** related accounts unless you specify otherwise.

  

Please note that the process is not instant; as per the Regulations under the GDPR, AniDB has up to 30 days to comply with your request.

  

Furthermore, please note that AniDB will not remove data which AniDB does not consider personal and is used to enrich AniDB. Such "enriching" content includes, but is not limited to: reviews, recommendations, similar anime suggestions, votes, and forum posts; all of these items are available publicly on the Site . AniDB considers forum posts as public content since the forums can be accessed without restriction; we will not remove forum posts as part of an account removal request. If you wish, you can manually review your forums posts and remove any personal data from them; however, to reduce disruption to the discussion in the affected forum thread, we ask that you be considerate and minimise any modifications or deletions.

  

* AniDB will pseudonymize the username associated with "enriching" content. This is an alternative to outright deletion, and it is a valid method for AniDB to comply with your request under the GDPR Regulations. We will gladly arbiter your appeal; however, AniDB reminds you that to ensure the continued operation of the Site, it is reasonable that AniDB retain rudimentary pseudonymized non-personal data associated with content contributed to AniDB.

  

If you have questions about the Account Removal procedure, contact us via IRC.
