to Bark upon registration and use of your Account, and at all other times will be true,

accurate, current, and complete and you agree to update such information as

necessary to ensure that it remains complete, accurate and up-to-date. You agree to

online dangers (such as cyberbullying) or potential signs of trouble (such as depression) are identified in

email or text messages and/or interactions with designated social media sites or websites involving the

Subscriber. For this purpose, each Subscriber is allocated an account (a “Covered Account”). The Bark

Monitoring Services include automated review by our proprietary technologies of communications involving

the Covered Account. This review may include the use of listening devices, such as in relation to audio

files. The Bark Monitoring Services currently support English, Spanish and Afrikaans language interactions

only; additional language interactions may become available in the future.

guardian of the Subscriber specified for any Covered Account to be monitored by the

Manager is a parent in a household having two parents, both parents must share credentials to allow both

parents to act as administrators for their household. Parents and legal guardians of Dependents, please be

advised that we do not recommend that children under the age of 18 be given administrative access to the

Bark Jr Services, with or without supervision. Managed Users are not given administrative access unless

the Manager specifically grants such permissions to a specific Administrative User account. Each Manager

and/or Administrative User who signs on as an administrator, represents and affirms that such Manager

and/or Administrative User is the age of 18 or older, or that the Manager has given them permission, in

writing, that they can act as an administrator. The Manager whose Dependent is acting as an administrator,

represents and affirms that such Manager duly appointed such Dependent as an administrator and agreed

in writing that such Dependent could act as an administrator for such Manager on behalf of the Managed

Account(s).



4.2 Managed Users. The Manager, hereby represents that:



4.2.1 where the Managed User is a Dependent, whether using Bark Jr Services or Bark

Home Services, Manager acts for and on behalf of such Managed User in consenting to and granting the

right for Bark to access, use and disclose such Managed User’s Personal Data as necessary for Bark to

provide the Bark Management Services; and



4.2.2 where the Managed User is an adult, Manager has all necessary authority and/or has

obtained all necessary consents from such Managed User to enable Bark to access, use and disclose each

such Managed User’s Personal Data as necessary for Bark to provide the Bark Management Services.

Bark retains the right, but not the obligation, to confirm the consent of any such Managed User. In the event

such a Managed User does not confirm his/her consent, Bark may remove the Managed User from the

Manager’s Managed Accounts.

Page 18 of 28



4.3 User Conduct Guidelines. Any time Manager or any Administrative User accesses or uses

the Products, Manager and Administrative Users are required to comply with Bark’s user conduct

guidelines, as follows:



4.3.1 Manager agrees that Manager and Administrative Users will access and use the

Products for Manager’s personal, family, community, or internal business use only, and not on behalf of any

third party.

(a) to impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent

Manager’s or Administrative User’s identity, credentials, affiliations or

intentions;



(b) to collect, store, or use any information from or about a Managed User without

such Managed User’s authorization and consent;



(c) to “stalk” or harass a Managed User;



(d) if Manager or Administrative User is not able to form legally binding contracts

(for example, if Manager or Administrative User is under 18, and does not

have the consent of his/her parent or legal guardian);



(e) if Manager or Administrative User is a person barred from receiving services

under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction; or



(f) for any other purposes that are not expressly permitted by these Terms.



21.8 Misconduct; Investigations.



4.3.3 Right to Monitor Access. You and Managed User, acknowledge that Bark has the

right, but not the obligation, at any time and without prior notice, to monitor access to or use of the Bark

Management Services by any user if Bark believes in good faith that it is reasonably necessary (i) to

comply with any law or regulation or satisfy any legal process or governmental request (for example, a

subpoena, warrant, order or other requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental

body), (ii) to respond to claims asserted against Bark, (iii) to enforce and to ensure a user’s compliance with

these Bark Management Services Terms, including the investigation of potential violations, (iv) to conduct

risk assessments, and prevent, detect and investigate incidents of fraud, security and technical issues, (v)

to protect the rights, property or safety of Bark, its other users or members of the public, and (vi) for the

purpose of operating and improving the Bark Management Services and Bark Devices (including for

support purposes). Bark reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to investigate and take appropriate

action in response to reports of misconduct. Regardless of its action or inaction, in no event will Bark be

liable for the acts or omissions of any Manager, Administrative User, Managed User or any third party.



4.3.4 Cooperation by Manager. Manager agrees to cooperate with and assist Bark or its

representative in good faith in any such investigations, including by providing us with such information as

Bark may reasonably request.



4.4 Subscription Equipment. You acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to any

Subscription Equipment provided to you by Bark under these Terms:



4.4.1 Changes and Upgrades to Subscription Equipment. Bark may upgrade, replace,

remove, add or otherwise change the Subscription Equipment at our discretion at any time any Services

are active or following the termination of your Services. You consent to such changes including software,

firmware and other code updates or downloads, with or without notice to you, which may alter, add to, or

remove features or functionalities of the Subscription Equipment or Services. You acknowledge and agree

that our addition or removal of or change to the Subscription Equipment may interrupt your Services. Bark

Page 19 of 28



may, at its option, provide new or reconditioned Subscription Equipment, including replacing your existing

Subscription Equipment. You agree that such changes may be performed within Bark’s sole discretion at

any time and in any manner. If Bark requests that you replace, or offers to replace your Subscription

Equipment in order to provide you with better Services or stronger security, and you do not do so, Bark is

not responsible for any resulting degradation of service or security vulnerabilities. If Bark requires that you

add or replace Subscription Equipment and you do not do so, your Services may be disconnected and/or

terminated.



4.4.2 Return of Subscription Equipment. You agree that in the event your Services are

terminated, you will return all Subscription Equipment to Bark within thirty (30) days of termination, unless

otherwise instructed in writing by a Bark representative. If you upgrade or downgrade your Services and

the Subscription Equipment that you possess is no longer required to support your new Bark Services, you

must promptly return such Subscription Equipment. Such Subscription Equipment must be returned within

thirty (30) days of notifying Bark of your decision to downgrade/upgrade your Service(s), unless otherwise

instructed in writing by a Bark representative. The returned Subscription Equipment must be in good

condition and without any encumbrances, except for ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use.

Upon your notification to Bark that you intend to terminate or downgrade/upgrade Services in a manner

requiring return of your Subscription Equipment, Bark will issue you a return material authorization (“RMA”)

number and you will mail the Subscription Equipment to:



Bark Technologies, Inc.

Attn: Bark Device Replacements

3423 Piedmont Rd NE, Suite 360

Atlanta GA 30305



The RMA number must be included on the outside carton label of the returned Subscription Equipment.

Bark will inspect the Subscription Equipment for damage upon receipt. This provision shall survive the

termination or expiration of this Agreement.



4.4.3 If you do not promptly return your Subscription Equipment in accordance with this

Section 4.5, or if it is returned damaged or missing components (“Unreturned Subscription Equipment”), the

damages Bark will incur will be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, Bark may charge your account for your

Unreturned Subscription Equipment, a one-time Unreturned Subscription Equipment charge as liquidated

damages in an amount equal to Bark’s reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs

that Bark incurs (the “Unreturned Subscription Equipment Charge”); provided, however, that such amount

will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law or the replacement cost of the Subscription

Equipment. You will be responsible for (i) any missing components of, or damage to the Subscription

Equipment as assessed by Bark upon receipt, (ii) the replacement cost of such Subscription Equipment if it

is lost or damaged during transit, and (iii) shipping/handling costs, unless Bark provides written notice in

advance that it will pay such costs.



5. License Grant; Restrictions.

Terms, Bark hereby grants to Manager and Managed User a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable,

summary statistics on application and feature use, "up times," software response times, and other

measures of application usage and performance; and for purposes with similar objectives of application

improvement, improved feature development, and user behavior studies and reports. By using the Bark

Management Services, Manager and Managed User, agree to and hereby do assign, transfer, grant, and

convey all rights, title, and interest in and to the Usage Data to Bark. To the extent that such an assignment

perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, transferable license to use the Usage

Data for the above-described purposes.



6.6 Account Data. Bark claims no ownership over the Account Data of the Manager and

non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, transferable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display,

the purposes of providing the Bark Management Services. As between Bark and Manager or Managed

User, as the case may be, Manager and Managed User retain all copyright and trademark rights to any of

such Account Data.



7. Data Protection and Privacy.



7.1 Protection of Personal Data. Bark processes and uses the Account Data of the Manager and

Managed User to deliver, analyze, support and improve the Products and as otherwise permitted in these

Bark Management Services Terms and the Privacy Policy. Bark will maintain appropriate administrative,

physical and technical safeguards, which are designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of

Personal Data processed by Bark. Manager and Managed User agree that Bark may share their Account

Data with third party service providers consistent with the Privacy Policy in order to assist in providing and

improving the Products, provided that such third-party service providers agree to provide no less than the

same level of data protection and information security required of Bark hereunder.

are hereby incorporated by reference and apply to these Bark Management Services Terms with the

necessary amendments (mutatis mutandis).

transfer of Account Data that constitutes Personal Data, Bark shall ensure that, notwithstanding any cross-

border transfer of data, it shall always remain compliant with its obligations under Section 7.1 of these Bark

Management Services Terms.



7.4 Communications. By using the Bark Management Services or providing Personal Data to

Bark, Manager and Managed User agree that Bark may communicate with Manager electronically

regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to Manager’s and Managed User’s use of the

Bark Management Services, as well as for product releases, product updates, marketing events, and third-

party products or services Bark would like to communicate with Manager about. If Bark learns of a security

breach, Bark may attempt to notify Manager electronically by posting a notice on the Bark Management

Services or sending an email to Manager. Manager may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.

To receive written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw Manager’s consent from receiving electronic

notice), please write to Bark at help@bark.us.



8. Limitations of the Bark Management Services; Location Services.



8.1 Content Blocking Not Guaranteed. Manager and Managed User acknowledge that use of the

Management Services does not guarantee that content Manager or Managed User deems objectionable

will be 100% unavailable at all times or at any time. Manager and Managed User assume full risk and

responsibility for the use of or reliance on the Bark Management Services as regards content blocking.

“False positive” content blocking may occur from time to time or at any time. Bark strives to allow

sufficiently granular control of content filters to allow educational or meritorious content through, if that is

Page 23 of 28



the intent of the user. However, there is no guarantee that some content that Manager or Managed User

would deem acceptable will not be blocked by the Bark Management Services. In the event that Manager

or Managed User believes Bark is mis-categorizing a site or service, please contact Bark support

at help@bark.us to submit the issue for review.



8.2 Service Limitations. There are certain circumstances that may limit the availability or

effectiveness of the Bark Management Services, including:



8.2.1 Service Area - The Bark Management Services are currently configured for use in the

local jurisdiction in which Manager and Managed User registered for the Bark Management Services. For

example, users that registered for the Bark Management Services in the United States will be limited to use

of the Bark Management Services only in the United States, and users that registered for the Bark

Management Services in another country will be limited to use of the Bark Management Services in such

country. Notwithstanding the foregoing, use of the Bark Management Services and Bark Devices is limited

to the United States and those other countries and/or territories identified in Section 13 of the General

Terms and Conditions. Any use of the Bark Management Services and/or Bark Devices outside of such

countries and/or territories is strictly prohibited.



8.2.2 Service Interruptions - The Bark Management Services can be interrupted for any

reason that disrupts internet access or GPS capabilities, including in the event of: (a) electrical power

outages, (b) natural disasters, (c) electronic interference, (d) an outage affecting the data transport service,

(e) failure of originating or terminating access lines, (f) network congestion and/or reduced routing speed of

Bark’s network or another network (for example, due to spikes in call volume in the wake of local or national

disasters), causing failed calls, busy signals or unexpected answering wait times (which may be longer than

emergency calls placed via traditional telephone networks), (g) compatibility issues, or (h) equipment

failures relating to your equipment (e.g., your mobile phone) or Bark’s equipment, including, hardware or

software failures or misconfiguration affecting Bark, its offices, data centers, and/or any of its service

providers.



8.2.3 Location Services. Certain features of the Services are designed to collect and share

location information about your Users. To access and use these features, the Services collect location,

sensory and motion data from your User(s)’ mobile device to share location information and otherwise

provide or facilitate the features and functionality of the Services. To work properly, these features require

the corresponding Bark App to be installed on the User Device for which location and movement data will

be provided, and require access to location, sensory and motion data from the User Device. These features

may not work properly if the corresponding device permissions and settings allowing access to location,

sensory and motion data are not properly configured or enabled. In addition, the features may not work for

a variety of reasons, such as if the device that the Bark App is installed on is not powered on and

connected to the wireless service provider’s network (e.g., it will not work if the phone is connected to a wi-

fi network), if location services are turned off, if the Services are not being used or are blocked on the User

Device, if the User is making a phone call through the User Device, and for other reasons. Please refer to

your User’s app settings to learn more about accessing and using these features.



9. Warranty and Support.



9.1 Limited Warranty on the Bark Devices. This limited warranty covers the operation of Bark

Devices in Manager’s and Managed User’s home network. All Bark Devices purchased from Bark (which,

for the avoidance of doubt, excludes all Third Party Hardware), carry a warranty of operability for a period

of twelve (12) months from the date of purchase from a Service Provider. Subscription Equipment carries a

warranty of operability for a period equal to the term of your subscription for such Subscription Equipment.

If a Bark Device fails to power on, does not successfully initialize, or otherwise fails due to a manufacturing

defect or through the normal use or wear of the Bark Device when used in accordance with Bark’s

applicable specifications during the warranty period, MANAGER’S AND MANAGED USER’S FIRST

RECOURSE FOR REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES IS TO THE RETAILER WHERE THE DEVICE WAS

PURCHASED ACCORDING TO THE RETAILER’S RETURN POLICIES. If the retailer is unable to

exchange or refund the purchase, or if the Bark Device was purchased directly from Bark or is provided by

Bark as Subscription Equipment, Manager or Managed User may send the malfunctioning device, along

with a copy of the purchase receipt, a return material authorization (“RMA”) number issued in advance by

our technical support agent, and, if applicable, a description of the problems encountered, to:

Page 24 of 28



Bark Technologies, Inc.

Attn: Bark Device Replacements

3423 Piedmont Rd NE, Suite 360

Atlanta GA 30305



When requesting an RMA number, proof of purchase or proof of installation by a Service Provider must be

provided. The RMA number must be included on the outside carton label of the returned Bark Device. Bark

will inspect the Bark Device and any accompanying documentation of malfunction. After such inspection,

and depending upon the findings of such inspection, Bark may, at its discretion: (i) return the Bark Device

to the Manager or Managed User with a certification that it is functional; (ii) repair any manufacturing defect

or malfunction caused by the normal use or wear of the Bark Device when used in accordance with Bark’s

applicable specifications, and then return the Bark Device to the Manager or Managed User with a

certification that a repair has been made, and that the Bark Device should now function according to Bark’s

applicable specifications; (iii) issue a refund to Manager or Managed User (for Bark Devices purchased

directly from Bark); (iv) send a replacement Bark Device to Manager or Managed User; or (v) notify

Manager or Managed User that the device is not subject or entitled to the limited warranty. IF THE BARK

DEVICE IS SUBJECT AND ENTITLED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY, MANAGER OR MANAGED USER

SHALL BE ENTITLED UNDER THIS SECTION TO A REFUND OF ITS PURCHASE PRICE, REPAIR OF

ITS BARK DEVICE, OR A REPLACEMENT BARK DEVICE, AT BARK’S ELECTION. MANAGER AND

MANAGED USER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER

ANY WEAR OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE INCORRECT USE OF A BARK DEVICE, AND

PROVIDES NO OTHER REMEDIES OR IMPLIES ANY LIABILITY ON BARK’S PART. This limited

warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.



9.2 Third Party Hardware. Insofar as the Manager and/or Managed User utilizes the Bark

Management Software installed on Third Party Hardware, including without limitation a User Device, any

questions or concerns related to the functioning of the hardware must be handled in accordance with the

third party’s expressed warranty and remediation processes. Bark in no way assumes responsibility for the

functionality or operability of Third Party Hardware and the limited warranty set forth in Section 9.1 of these

Bark Management Services Terms above does not cover any Third Party Hardware, including, without

limitation, any User Devices, regardless of whether such hardware incorporates Bark technology or Bark

Management Software.



9.3 Disclaimer of Warranties.



THE BARK DEVICES, THE SUPPORT SERVICES, THE API, THE BARK CONTENT, AND THE BARK

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE ARE ALL OFFERED "AS IS" AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO THE EXTENT

BE CORRECTED. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY

YOU FROM BARK OR FROM USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SUPPORT SERVICES SHALL CREATE

ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTY. FURTHERMORE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

BARK AND ITS COLLABORATORS, SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO

CORRECT ANY ERRORS OR OTHERWISE.



9.4 Manager Acknowledgements and Warranties. Manager and Managed User represent and

related rights, in connection with Account Data or otherwise in connection with Manager’s and Managed

User’s access to or use of the Products;



9.4.6 the exercise by Bark of the rights granted by Manager and Managed User hereunder

accurate and up-to-date when provided, and updated as necessary to ensure that it remains complete,

9.5 Modifications and Updates. Bark reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or

discontinue offering any Product(s), in whole or in part, including any features, functionality, tools or content

thereof, at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice to Manager or Managed User. Bark

may from time to time develop and provide Updates for the Products. Updates may also modify or delete

features, functionality, tools or content in their entirety. Based on Product settings, when Product(s) are

connected to the internet either: (a) the Updates will automatically download and install; or (b) Manager

may receive notice of or be prompted to download and install available Updates. Manager agrees to

promptly download and install all required or automated Updates made available by Bark from time to time,

including all available patches to address security, interoperability or performance issues. If Manager does

not install the latest Updates, portions of the Products may not properly operate. All Updates will be

deemed part of the Products and be subject to all terms and conditions of these Bark Management

Services Terms. Manager agrees that Bark has no obligation to provide any Updates or to continue to

provide or enable any particular features, functionality, tools or content, and will not be liable with respect to

any such modifications, discontinuances or deletions.



9.6 Supported Uses. Use of the Products is limited to the systems and applications that are

supported. Manager is required to read the documentation delivered with the Products or provided online

Page 26 of 28



installations, means of mass transportation, aviation, life-support computers or equipment (including

resuscitation equipment and surgical implants), pollution control, hazardous substances management, or

for any other dangerous application in which the failure of the Products could create a situation where

personal injury or death may occur. Manager and Managed User understand that use of the Products in

such applications is fully at the risk of Manager and Managed User.



9.7 Permission to Access; Support. Manager and Managed User understand and agree that

directly requesting Support Services through any communication channel for the setup, continued use, or

technical troubleshooting of its Products or Managed Account(s) will also constitute express permission to

allow Bark or its duly authorized support representatives to access Manager’s and Managed User’s

Products, User Device(s) or Managed Account details remotely for the sole purposes of viewing or

changing logs, configurations, software processes, or any other information stored locally on such

Products, User Device or in Bark servers. Bark requires such access in order to troubleshoot, debug, or

optimize the setup or use of the Bark Management Services. Manager may limit the level of access Bark or

its duly authorized support representatives have to Manager's and Managed User’s Products or User

Devices or Managed Account only by explicitly stating at the moment of the support request the specific

limitations they wish to impose with regard to the logs, diagnostics, configurations, software processes, or

other locally-stored information. Manager and Managed User agree that nothing in these Bark Management

Services Terms shall obligate Bark to provide any Support Services for the Products. Bark may, but shall

be under no obligation to, correct any defects in the Products and/or provide updates to the Products.

Manager shall make reasonable efforts to promptly report to Bark any defects it finds in the Products, as an

aid to creating improved revisions of the Products. MANAGER AND MANAGED USER UNDERSTAND

“AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, BARK MAKES NO

REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO

THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SUPPORT SERVICES OR AS TO

THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT OR MATERIALS OBTAINED OR

MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SUPPORT SERVICES. YOUR USE OF THE SUPPORT

SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT OR MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR MADE AVAILABLE

AS PART OF THE SUPPORT SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. MANAGER AND MANAGED USER

ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS ARE IN

ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN SUBSTITUTION OF, THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH

IN SECTIONS 9.2 OF THESE BARK MANAGEMENT SERVICES TERMS AND SECTION 7 OF THE

GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.



10. Confidentiality.



10.1 Obligations. Manager and Managed User acknowledge and agree that any documentation

relating to the Products, and any other information (if such other information is identified as confidential or

should be recognized as confidential under the circumstances) provided to Manager or Managed User by

Bark hereunder shall constitute “Confidential Information” of Bark, and that Manager's and Managed User’s

protection thereof is an essential condition to Manager's and Managed User’s use and possession of the

Products. Manager and Managed User shall: (a) retain all Confidential Information in strict confidence and

not disclose it to any third party unless otherwise required to comply with law or a binding order of a court of

governmental authority with the authority to require disclosure. Manager and Managed User will exercise at

least the same amount of diligence in preserving the secrecy of the Confidential Information as it uses in

preserving the secrecy of its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable diligence.

Information shall not be considered Confidential Information if and to the extent that it: (i) was in the public

domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of the Manager or

Managed User; (ii) was known to the Manager or Managed User, without restriction, at the time of

disclosure as proven by the files of Manager or Managed User in existence at the time of disclosure; or (iii)

was developed by or for Manager or Managed User without use or knowledge of or access to Confidential

Information or violation of these Bark Management Services Terms or (iv) becomes known to Manager or

Managed User, without restriction, from a source other than Bark without breach of these Bark

Management Services Terms by Manager or Managed User and otherwise not in violation of Bark’s rights.

tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information and all copies thereof which are in the

Page 27 of 28



possession of Manager and Managed User shall be and remain the property of Bark, and shall be promptly

returned to Bark or destroyed, and all electronic copies deleted, upon written request by Bark or upon

termination of these Bark Management Services Terms.



10.3 Injunctive Relief. In addition to any other rights and remedies available to Bark hereunder or

at law, Manager and Managed User acknowledge and agree that any breach of confidentiality and non-

disclosure such obligations may result in irreparable and continuing damage to Bark for which there will be

no adequate remedy in damages, and the Bark will be authorized and entitled to seek injunctive relief,

without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required, and/or a decree for specific

performance, and such further relief as may be proper from a court with competent jurisdiction.



11. Payment; Service Providers.



11.1 Purchases, Subscription Equipment and Payment Terms. If Manager or Managed User

purchases Products directly from Bark, and/or subscribe for Subscription Equipment, Manager and

Managed User hereby authorize Bark to charge the purchase amount and/or subscription fee to the

Payment Mechanism on file in the amounts and on such payment dates as set forth in the Managed

Account. Manager further authorizes Bark to charge any applicable Unreturned Subscription

Equipment Charge to the Payment Mechanism on file with Bark. If Manager or Managed User

purchased Products through a Service Provider, all payment-related terms (including, but not limited to,

pricing, invoicing, billing, payment methods, delivery, returns, and late payment charges) will be set forth in

Manager’s or Managed User’s agreement directly with such Service Provider. Notwithstanding anything to

the contrary, the agreement between Manager or Managed User and Service Provider: (i) shall not modify

any of the terms set forth herein, and (ii) is not binding on Bark.



11.2 Account Data. If Manager or Managed User purchases Products through a Service Provider,

acknowledge and agree that Bark is not liable in any way with respect to such access or use of such

Account Data by a Service Provider.
