We respect your privacy. Really. Car-Seat.Org has never sold or processed user data in almost 20 years since our site began. We do not collect data on unregistered visitors and have never shared any personal information without explicit written consent from a member. Visitors may even post anonymously as an unregistered guest, subject to moderator approval delays. Members are welcome to use anonymous usernames and email addresses, but must confirm an email address to be approved as a registered member. IP addresses are only scanned against malicious activity databases upon registration and posting to prevent spammer, hacker and other nuisance posts. IP addresses may be stored for a limited time but only if a user submits a post or message. Unlike facebook and other services, we do not require any other personal information unless voluntarily submitted by the member, such as in the case of a prize or contest award shared with the sponsor/shipper after obtaining written permission from the winner.
