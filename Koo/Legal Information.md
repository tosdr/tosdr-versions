##### Process for reporting intellectual property violations

Koo does not undertake any obligation to monitor user-generated content, except to the extent required by law. Koo is only an intermediary that primarily enables online interaction between two or more users and allows them to create, upload, share, disseminate, modify or access information using Koo’s services.  
We reserve the right to withdraw or suspend or terminate Services at any time without prior notice. Grievance Redressal Services or responses to requests will be delayed during such withdrawal or suspension or termination.  
While Koo supports valid and legitimate claims of intellectual property ownership, it cannot and does not adjudicate any claims. In the first instance, parties must resolve any disputes relating to intellectual property amongst themselves or through the legal process, before reporting to Koo  
If you believe that someone is violating your or anyone else’s intellectual property, you may report it by filling out this [form](https://forms.zohopublic.in/bombinatetechnologiespvtltd/form/FormforReportingViolationsofIntellectualPropertyRi/formperma/J3ChpO1grsdun2-Yi-3TC9REsaFpUGtu-DKVHRgvBuw).  
Please ensure that you submit complete details of the violation and ownership of the intellectual property in order for us to process the report. Such reports will typically be processed within 48 hours. Orders or directions of courts or legal authorities will be honoured on priority.  
The contents of a report (including any attachment) and the reporter’s email address will be provided to the person who posted the contested content along with a request to respond to the claim within 36 hours. Parties are encouraged to directly interact and resolve any issues. If no response is received within the specified time, or, if in the sole discretion of Koo, either the report or the response are unsatisfactory, Koo will take such action as it deems fit. Please note that Koo is acting on a best efforts basis and accepts no responsibility for any actions taken by it. Any assertion or adjudication of legal rights must be carried out through the legal process  
Any abuse of this process may lead to termination of your user account and/or other legal consequences. Please do not hesitate to seek your own legal advice before filing or contesting any report for intellectual property violation.
