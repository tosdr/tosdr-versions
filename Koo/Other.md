##### WHAT IS A KOO ACCOUNT OF EMINENCE?

In recognition of eminence or impact or stature or achievements or abilities or professional status, Koo awards a Yellow Tick against user profiles. The award of the Yellow Tick is based on predefined criteria and is a recognition that the user is a significant representative of the Voices of India and Indians.

##### HOW IS THE EMINENCE YELLOW TICK AWARDED?

The Koo Eminence Tick cannot be purchased. It is based on predefined criteria which recognizes the eminence or stature or achievements or abilities or professional status. The evaluation criteria has been created in the Indian context and may be subject to change. Koo is committed to recognizing eminence in all domains.

Koo uses a mix of internal research and third-party public resources in evaluating applications for Eminence Recognition. The criteria is reviewed in March, June, September and December of each year to respond to changes in landscape. Koo may also award the Yellow Tick of Eminence in exceptional circumstances not covered in the criteria.

Users may apply for Yellow Tick Eminence recognition from within the Koo App or by writing to [eminence.verification@kooapp.com](mailto:eminence.verification@kooapp.com). An evaluation response will be provided within 10 (ten) days. In certain cases responses may be delayed in order for the criteria to be met. Koo reserves the right to deny or revoke eminence tick to any accounts at its discretion and may not provide reasons for such denial.

##### LOSS OF EMINENCE

Koo may remove the Eminence recognition at any time and without notice if the original criteria for the award of eminence have changed. Users on Koo are required to comply with Koo [Community Guidelines](https://community-guidelines/), [Terms of Service](https://terms-of-service/), or [Privacy Policy](https://terms-of-service/). Koo will suspend/remove accounts that use imagery of, or similar to, the Eminence badge in a manner that may mislead the public about the accounts’ status. The criteria are neither exhaustive nor definitive and any miss is unintentional and inadvertent. Koo is committed to recognizing eminence in all domains of Indian life. In case of any questions or concerns please write to [eminence.verification@kooapp.com](mailto:eminence.verification@kooapp.com)
