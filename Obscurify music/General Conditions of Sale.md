Shipping and Returns
====================

SHIPPING
========

**When will I get my order?  
**  
Usually, it takes 3–7 days to fulfill an order, after which it’s shipped out. The shipping time depends on your location, but can be estimated as follows:  
● USA: 3–4 business days  
● Europe: 6–8 business days  
● Australia: 2–14 business days  
● Japan: 4–8 business days  
● International: 10–20 business days  

Due to COVID-19, Our fulfillment times may be longer than usual and may continue to increase until things get back to normal. We’re seeing delays in our supply chain, including distributors and shipping carriers as the entire industry is grappling with challenges.

**My order should be here by now, but I still don’t have it. What should I do?  
**  
Before getting in touch with us, please help us out by doing the following:  
● Check your shipping confirmation email for any mistakes in the delivery address  
● Ask your local post office if they have your package  
● Stop by your neighbors in case the courier left the package with them  
If the shipping address was correct, and the package wasn’t left at the post office or at your neighbor’s, get in touch with us at [\[email protected\]](https://spotiparel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with your order number.  
If you did find a mistake in your delivery address, we can send you a replacement order, but shipping will be at your own cost.

**For other shipping information, please refer to our [Terms and Conditions.](https://spotiparel.com/terms-and-conditions/)**

RETURNS
=======

Spotiparel prints your customized order as soon as they come in, so we unfortunately cannot offer refunds or size replacements. However if there’s something wrong with your order (i.e. misprint or issue with your item), please follow the instructions below.

Spotiparel does not issue replacements for buyers remorse (including song choice), incorrect sizing, or choosing the wrong color. Items are custom-made, so once your order is placed nothing can be changed. Should you attempt to return your item for any issue not related to a misprint or issue with clothing you will not be reimbursed.

**MISPRINTED ITEMS**
--------------------

Although we’ve never had severe misprints get shipped to your doorsteps as they all get screened during our QA process, if you notice a misprint or a damage in your item, we will happily replace it for you.

Any claims for misprinted/damaged/defective items must be submitted within 4 weeks after the product has been received. For packages lost in transit, all claims must be submitted no later than 4 weeks after the estimated delivery date. Claims deemed an error on our part are covered at our expense.

If you notice a severe misprint or an issue with the product you have received, please let us know by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://spotiparel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), with your order number and pictures to help expedite the process.

**WRONG ADDRESS**
-----------------

If you provide an address that is considered insufficient by the courier, the shipment will be returned to our facility. You will be liable for reshipment costs once we have confirmed an updated address with you (if and as applicable).

****NOTIFICATION FOR EU CUSTOMERS****
-------------------------------------

According to Article 16(c) and (e) of the Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, the right of withdrawal may not be provided for:

1\. the supply of goods that are made to the consumer’s specifications or are clearly personalized;  
2\. sealed goods which were unsealed after delivery and thus aren’t suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons,

therefore Spotiparel reserves rights to refuse returns at its sole discretion.
