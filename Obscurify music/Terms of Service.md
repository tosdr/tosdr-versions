Terms and Conditions
====================

Questions or concerns? Please do not hesitate to contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://spotiparel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with your **order #** and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible. 

Please review the following basic terms that govern your use of, and purchase of, products from Spotiparel. Please note that your use of Spotiparel constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by those terms.

### **INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING**

International orders are priced in USD and will be shipped through the shipping method of your choice. International shipping prices are shown at the checkout window and vary by country and weight of your order. While most packages make it to their final destination without any issues, Spotiparel is not responsible for the package once it lands in your resident country as we do not have any jurisdiction over international countries and their postal services. In the event that there are any issues after the package arrives in your resident country, the recipient is responsible for contacting their local postal service to resolve said issues. If your international shipment has been in-transit for over 20 days, please contact your local postal service or customs office to see if the package is being held for you and provide them with your tracking number along with a form of identification.

### **CUSTOMS / DUTIES FEES**

Spotiparel is not responsible for any customs/duties fees that may incur with international orders and is not included in the order total at checkout. The recipient is responsible for any and all fees determined by the customs office of their resident country. In the event that an order is returned due to a lack of claim, we will reach out to you via email to have the package shipped out for you again BUT the cost of shipping fees will need to be paid for again.

### **INCORRECT OR INSUFFICIENT ADDRESS**

If your order is returned to our facilities due to an invalid or insufficient address, lack of customs/duties payments, or other issues with being forwarded, we will reach out to you to have the package resent and will require a repayment of shipping fees. If you do not want the package to be reshipped to your address, we will process the item accordingly, but you will not receive a refund as our items are custom made based on your choices. And if we do not receive a response within 30 days from when the email is sent, the order will be null and voided.

### **LOST PACKAGES** 

We are not responsible for packages that have been lost by mail couriers. Once we have given the package to the service provider we no longer have the ability to reroute or intercept the package, along with making any updates to the address that the package is being delivered to. If your package has been lost, we advise that you reach out directly to the courier to open up a claim with them as they would be able to better assist you regarding locating your package. 

### **MODIFICATIONS TO SERVICES AND PRICES**

Prices on our products are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the service (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time. We are not liable to you or any third-party for any modifications, price changes, suspensions or discontinuance of the service.

### **RETURN & EXCHANGE POLICY**

We don’t offer returns and exchanges, but if there’s something wrong with your order (i.e. misprint or issue with your item), please let us know by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://spotiparel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), with your order number and pictures, and we will ship a replacement. Spotiparel does not issue replacements for buyers remorse (including song choice), incorrect sizing, or choosing the wrong color. Items are custom made, so once your order is placed nothing can be changed. Should you attempt to return your item for any issue not related to a misprint or issue with clothing you will not be reimbursed.

### **COLORS**

We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear at Spotiparel. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display of any color will be accurate.
