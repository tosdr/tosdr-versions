* **Event Bookings**

It is part of our terms and conditions that we require payment on booking. This means that you need a credit/debit card to hand to book a place one of our courses. In special circumstances we will accept an official purchase order number – please phone 01384 376464.

The fee for this event covers all written materials and lunch. Joining instructions will be sent to you acknowledging your booking. 

**Discounts**

Discounts for members are included in the price structure for each event.

**Payments**

For all events, payment MUST be made online at the time of booking. Invoices will only be issued to schools/colleges. Where an invoice is issued, the terms are as printed on the bottom of invoice and are strictly 30 days from the date of the invoice.

Payments made by schools/colleges can take the form of a cheque made payable to the Career Development Institute or via credit/debit cards. We accept Visa, Master Card, Switch or Delta..Please note once your payment has been processed, all card details are securely destroyed.

**Substitutions/cancellations**

Upon receipt of your booking form(s), your place(s) will be confirmed.

Any cancellation/substitutions must be received in writing before commencement of the event.

Payment for cancellation is as follows: 

0-14 days 100% 

15-30 days 50% 

31-60 days 25%

A substitute delegate can be selected no later than 7 days prior to commencement of the conference, after which an administration fee of £25.00 will be charged. Cancellation fees will still be applicable as stated.

**Accommodation/Travel**

Individual delegates are responsible for their own travel arrangements and costs.

**Recordings**

Where we take every effort to provide recordings of all of our digital events, we cannot guarantee the quality of the event livestreams or of the provided recordings. Technical issues may occur on the day which reduce the quality of the recording, render it unrecoverable, or potentially require us to edit out segments of footage deemed to be unsuitable for broadcast. 

**Important note**

This booking form constitutes a legally binding contract. It may be necessary for reasons beyond the control of the Career Development Institute to change content and timing of the programme.

In the unlikely event of the programme being cancelled, the Career Development Institute will automatically make a full refund but disclaim any further liability

* **Refunds**

In order to request a refund, you must email our Finance Manager at [accounts@thecdi.net](mailto:accounts@thecdi.net). A refund can only be granted within 28 days after the purchase.

If a payment was made digitally (by card, BACS, or Paypal), once a refund is approved it can take up to 10 days for a refund to appear on your bank statement. If the payment was made by cheque, the refund will need to be reviewed by our Finance Manager and correlated with the cheque book - this is a once a week process, and once a refund cheque has been cut and despatched, it can take up to 30 days for the refund to arrive depending on your location and the postal service. International payments can take up to two weeks to process, depending on your international bank account. 

* **Direct Debits**

The CDI accepts Direct Debit payments in single fees or in installments, but additional fees may be charged for payments paid in installments. These discounts or additional fees are subject to change at any point during the membership term, although notification of all payments included in these changes will be given well in advance.

Please note that direct debit payments at the time of writing only include CDI Membership at £105 and do not take into account the Professional Register. Payment for the Professional Register will be required seperately before the account can be activated, and this payment cannot be made by direct debit at this time.
