### What We Do With The Information We Gather

We require this information to understand your professional needs and provide you with a better range of services, and in particular for the following reasons:

* For customer service and resolution purposes.

* Proximity card access is provided from the main data centre building and is issued to provide access only to authorised facilities management suites.

The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
* We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website and app in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
* Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website and app, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website and app. The ICO provide an extensive explanation of the ways that you can block cookies, please visit [https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/) for more information on how to block cookies.

We use this information to identify how and where we can improve the customer experience. The information collected through these cookies is anonymous and does not identify specific individuals or their details.

####  _Social Sharing_

Please note that if you wish to share a product on a third-party website (such as Facebook, Twitter etc) you may be sent cookies from these websites. We don't control the setting of these cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.

### **Links To Other Websites**

Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

### Controlling Your Personal Information

You may exercise any of the rights described in this section by sending an email to [privacy@thecdi.net](mailto:privacy@thecdi.net) Please note that we will ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

* Managing Your Information. It is your responsibility as a member of the Career Development Institute to regularly check and update your personal information through the members’ area of the website.
* Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information. You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you, but you can also do this for yourself.
* Data Access and Portability. You have the right to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
* Data Retention and Erasure. We generally retain your personal information for a period of five years after your last active use of our website or app (in line with our legal obligation to keep order information for this duration for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations). If you no longer want us to keep your information, you can request that we erase your personal information. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:
* We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a Member Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Account to prevent that user from opening a new Member Account in the future.
* We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
* Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g. log records) may remain in our database but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
* Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing. Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you. Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information you may withdraw your consent at any time by sending a communication to the Career Development Institute specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, you have the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to paragraph 7.7 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the Career Development Institute override your own.
* Objection to Processing and Profiling. You are entitled to require the Career Development Institute not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
* Data Security. The security of our your data is very important to us. With this in mind we will take all appropriate steps to protect your data and will treat it with the utmost care and attention. We use ‘https’ technology to secure access to all areas of our websites. Access to your personal data is password-protected, and sensitive data such as payment card information is held securely by our 3rd party payment providers. We ensure that our systems are regularly monitored for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
* Lodging Complaints. You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by the Career Development Institute before the Information Commissioner's Office. In the UK, please read: [https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/raising-concerns/](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/raising-concerns/) for details of how to do this. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
* If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or emailing us at [privacy@thecdi.net](mailto:privacy@thecdi.net).
* We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission, are required by law to do so or it is required for the provision of our services as detailed above. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen.
