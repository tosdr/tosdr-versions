Valid email address is also needed to retrieve a lost password and to make a VPN connection.

You must maintain this information current, truthful, complete and accurate. You warrant that you are authorised to provide such information. You authorise us to verify your information at any time.

**Server load information.**  
We monitor the server performance in order to recommend the most suitable servers to our customers.  
Customer service information. vpnuk.net stores inquiries and communications with users through the Contact Us and

**Your personal data is processed for the purpose of providing you the best VPNUK services under the legal basis of performance of the contract between you and VPNUK, as provided in our Terms of Service.

**Your personal data protection rights  
**You may request us to inform you about the personal data that we have collected about you, to request any changes or correction of inaccurate information, to object to certain processing of personal data (e.g. for marketing purposes), to provide you with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to transmit (if technically feasible) your personal data to another controller, or to erase your personal data. You also may request to restrict the processing of your personal data (when there is a legal basis for that). In cases where your personal data is processed on a separate consent basis, you have the right at any time to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data.

If you disagree with your data processing by VPNUK, you are free not to use the VPNUK Service, and to discontinue using it at any time. You may request us to discontinue processing of your personal data, in which case your data will be processed only as much as it is necessary to effect the discontinuation of your use of the VPNUK Services (e.g., final settlement, or deleting all personal data based on your email address), or finalising other VPNUK’s legal relationship with you (e.g. accounting, invoicing, processing refunds).
