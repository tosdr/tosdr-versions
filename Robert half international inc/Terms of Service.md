References to “**you**” and “**your**” in these Terms will refer to both the individual using the Sites and to any such Organization. The Sites are intended for use by residents of the United States only. The Sites are controlled and/or operated from the United States, and are not intended to subject Robert Half to any non-U.S. jurisdiction or law. The Sites may not be appropriate or available for use in some non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any use of the Sites is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in doing so.

The Sites, including all content, information, and materials incorporated into or made available through the Sites, are the exclusive property of Robert Half or its suppliers, and are protected by U.S. and international law.
