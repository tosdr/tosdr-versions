* **Other Law Firms or Lawyers.** MM may share, at your direction or with your permission, your personal information with other law firms and/or other lawyers where we jointly represent a client and when we refer cases or potential cases to other counsel, or as otherwise required in connection with our legal representation of you. Personal information provided pursuant to an attorney/client relationship may not be shared with third parties except as is done with such precautions to preserve the confidentiality of such information and any attorney/client privilege as may attach to such information.
* **Authorities, Law Enforcement, and Private Parties.** MM may disclose personal information to comply with laws, regulations or other legal obligations, to assist in an investigation, to protect and defend our rights and property, or the rights or safety of third parties, to enforce our agreements, Terms of Use or agreements with third parties, or for crime-prevention purposes.
* **Business Transactions.** MM may disclose your personal information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a transaction (or potential transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, financing, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale, spin-off, or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, MM or our related companies (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
* **Advertising Partners.** We may share your personal information with third party advertising or joint marketing partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (including interest-based advertising) or at the time of collection.
* **Professional Advisors**. We may disclose your personal information to our professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.
* **Affiliates and Related Companies.** We may share your personal information with companies that are affiliated with us (that is, that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with us) or may be affiliated with us in the future for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
* **Consent**. MM may otherwise disclose your Personal Information in accordance with your prior direction or, in some cases, we may specifically ask you for your consent, such as when required by law.

YOUR CHOICES
------------

* **Opt-Out of Marketing Communications.** If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can let us know by sending an email to [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com) or by mail at the address provided below in the section called “Contact Us”. The electronic marketing communications we send may also contain an opt-out mechanism. Please note that it may take up to 10 calendar days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request. Please also contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate.
* **Text  Messages.** We may offer communications via SMS texts or similar technology sent by MM or our service providers, such as when we send you text messages for customer service, account-related, or marketing purposes. To stop receiving text messages from a short code operated by MM, reply STOP. Note that we may send you a message to confirm receipt of your STOP request. Message and data rates may apply for this service. You can also opt-out of MM marketing texts by emailing us your request and mobile telephone number to [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com).
* **Cookies**. Most browsers let you remove or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Platform and our Site may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
* **Advertising Choices**. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and are subject to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You can obtain more information about these companies’ information collection practices and opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from participating NAI and DAA members at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp and/or the DAA’s website at optout.aboutads.info. You can also limit collection of your information for interest-based ads by blocking third party cookies in your browser settings or using privacy plug-ins or ad blocking software that help you block third party cookies. In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for targeted online advertising purposes. Some of the third party advertising companies we may work with offer their own opt-out options that you can use to limit their use of your information for interest-based advertising, such as Google (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/about/ads),  or do not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above. Many of the opt-out preferences described in this section must be set on each device and/or browser for which you want them to apply. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you. Even after using these opt-out mechanisms, you may receive interest-based advertising from other companies.
* **“Do-Not-Track”.** Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a “Do Not Track” signal to the online services that you visit. At this time, the Site does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
* **Declining to Provide Information**. We need to collect personal information to provide certain services. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide those services.

INFORMATION SECURITY
--------------------

MM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the personal information we collect. Nevertheless, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks.

LINKED WEBSITES
---------------

This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or social media features that may be accessed through links that we provide for your convenience and information. Accessing those links will cause you to leave MM’s website and may result in the collection of information about you by a third party. We do not control, endorse or make any representations about those third party websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any site you interact with before allowing the collection and use of your information.

USING THE PLATFORM FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
-------------------------------------------------

MM is headquartered in the United States of America, and we may have affiliates and service providers in the United States and other countries. Please be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated, and other locations outside of your home country. The data protection and other laws of these countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using any portion of the Platform, you understand and, where applicable law permits, consent to the transfer of your personal information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties to whom we disclose it as described in this Privacy Policy.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

--------------------------------------------------------

The following disclosures supplement the information provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and apply to residents of certain U.S. states where local law requires us to provide additional information about our processing activities. For purposes of this section, “personal information” means “personal data” or “personal information” as such term is defined under applicable U.S. state privacy law but does not include information exempted from the scope of such law.

Where we maintain deidentified data, we will maintain and use the data in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the data except as required or permitted by law.

**Retention of Personal Information**

We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process it (and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means), and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer personal information.

Depending on your residency and subject to certain legal limitations and exceptions, you may have certain rights relating to your personal information, such as the rights listed below. Please note, these rights may not apply in your jurisdiction, or may otherwise be limited by applicable law.

* **Right to Know**. The right to confirm whether we are processing personal information about you and to obtain certain details about the personal information we have collected about you, including, where applicable:  
    \- the categories of personal information collected;  
    \- the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;  
    \- the purposes for which the personal information were collected;  
    \- the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties (if any), and the recipients to whom this personal information were disclosed;  
    \- the categories of personal information “sold” (if any), and the third parties to whom the personal information were sold; and  
    \- the categories of personal information shared for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising purposes (if any), and the categories of recipients to whom the personal information were disclosed for these purposes.

* **Right to Access & Portability.** The right to obtain access to the personal information we have collected about you and, where required by law, the right to obtain a copy of the personal information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another entity without hindrance.
* **Right to Correction.** The right to correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information. 
* **Right to Deletion.** The right to request the deletion of personal information that we maintain about you, subject to certain exceptions.
* **Right to Opt-Out of “Sales.”** If we “sell” your personal information within the meaning of applicable U.S. state privacy law, you can request to opt-out of such sales. In most cases, a “sale” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to a third party for monetary consideration or, in some cases, for other valuable consideration.
* **Right to Opt-Out of “Sharing” or “Targeted Advertising.”** If we share or use your personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising within the meaning of applicable U.S. state privacy law, you can request to opt-out. 
* **Right to Revoke Consent or Limit the Use of Sensitive Data.** Where provided under applicable U.S. state privacy law, you have the right to revoke your consent or to request we limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information to only certain business purposes set forth in applicable U.S. state privacy law.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination**. The right not to receive retaliatory or discriminatory treatment for exercising any of the rights described above. However, please note that if the exercise of the rights described above limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our services or engage with you in the same manner.  
     

**Exercising Your Privacy Rights**  
To request to exercise the privacy rights listed above where available under applicable law, please complete (or have your authorized agent complete) our interactive webform available by clicking here: Privacy Rights Portal, or call us toll-free at: 1-(844) 256-4550. 

If you wish to exercise your right to opt-out of “sales,” “sharing,” or “targeted advertising” as it relates to the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our Site, please click the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the persistent footer of the Site. Where required by applicable law, the Site also recognizes the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. Note that due to technological limitations, if you visit our Site from a different computer or device, or clear cookies on your browser that store your preferences, you will need to return to the Site to select your preferences or rebroadcast the GPC signal.  

While we take measures to ensure that those responsible for receiving and responding to your request are informed of your rights and how to help you exercise those rights, when contacting us to exercise your rights, we ask you to please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Tell Us Which Right You Are Exercising**: Specify which right you want to exercise and the personal information to which your request relates (if not to you).
* **Authorized Agents:** If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of another consumer, please clearly indicate this fact and your authority to act on such consumer’s behalf. We may require the consumer’s proof of identification, the authorized agent’s proof of identification, and any other information that we may request in order to verify your request, including evidence of valid permission to act on the consumer’s behalf.
* **Help Us Verify Your Identity**: Provide us with information to verify your identity. Please note that if we cannot initially verify your identity and confirm you are a resident of a state that offers the relevant right(s), we may request additional information to complete the verification process. Any personal information you disclose to us for purposes of verifying your identity will solely be used for the purpose of verification.
* **Direct Our Response Delivery**: Please provide us with an e-mail or mailing address through which we can provide our response. If you make the request by email, unless otherwise requested, we will assume that we can respond to the email address from which you made the request.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee or decline to comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 45 days of your request, or as otherwise required by applicable law. Occasionally it may take us longer than 45 days to respond, for instance if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this situation, we will notify you of the delay, and may continue to update you regarding the progress of our response.

**Appealing Privacy Rights Decisions**

Depending on your state of residency, you may be able to appeal a decision we have made in connection with a request you submit to us to exercise one of your privacy rights under applicable state privacy law. All appeal requests should be submitted by emailing us at contact@forthepeople.com with the subject line, “Privacy Request Appeal.” If you have concerns about the results of your appeal, depending on your state of residency, you have the ability to contact the Attorney General in your state.  
 

**Additional Notice to California Residents (Shine the Light)**  
If you are a California resident, we consider any request to opt-out of “sales” or “sharing” as a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

**Additional Notice to Nevada Residents**

Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A allows Nevada residents to opt-out of the “sale” of certain types of personal information. Subject to several exceptions, Nevada law defines “sale” to mean the exchange of certain types of personal information for monetary consideration to another person. If you are a Nevada resident who wishes to exercise your “sale” opt-out rights, you may submit a request to us using the contact information listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.
