MM may share your personal information with third-party service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf, such as web-hosting companies, mailing vendors, analytics providers, event hosting services, and information technology providers. These third-party service providers have limited access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions on our behalf and for no other purpose. MM will not share with third-party service providers any text message originator opt-in data and consent, or any election to receive SMS communications.
* **Other Law Firms or Lawyers**.

* **Business Transactions**. MM may disclose your personal information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a transaction (or potential transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, financing, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale, spin-off, or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, MM or our related companies (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

YOUR CHOICES
------------

* **Opt-Out of Marketing Communications**. If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can let us know by sending an email to [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com) or by mail at the address provided below in “Contact Us”. The electronic marketing communications we send may also contain an opt-out mechanism. Please note that it may take up to 10 calendar days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request. Please also contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate.
* **Text Messages**. We may offer communications via SMS texts or similar technology sent by MM or our service providers, such as when we send you text messages for customer service, account-related, or marketing purposes. To stop receiving text messages from a short code operated by MM, reply STOP. Note that we may send you a message to confirm receipt of your STOP request. Message and data rates may apply for this service. You can also opt-out of MM marketing texts by emailing us your request and mobile telephone number to [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com).
* **Cookies**. Most browsers let you remove or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Platform and our Site may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).
* **Advertising Choices**. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and are subject to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You can obtain more information about these companies’ information collection practices and opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising from participating NAI and DAA members at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) and/or the DAA’s website at optout.aboutads.info. You can also limit collection of your information for interest-based ads by blocking third party cookies in your browser settings or using privacy plug-ins or ad blocking software that help you block third party cookies. In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for targeted online advertising purposes. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you. Some of the third party advertising companies we may work with offer their own opt-out options that you can use to limit their use of your information for interest-based advertising. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms, such as Google ([https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)) and Facebook ([https://www.facebook.com/about/ads](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads)), or do not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above. Even after using these opt-out mechanisms, you may receive interest-based advertising from other companies.
* **Declining to Provide Information**. We need to collect personal information to provide certain services. If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide those services.

INFORMATION SECURITY
--------------------

MM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the personal information we collect. Nevertheless, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks.

LINKED WEBSITES
---------------

This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or social media features that may be accessed through links that we provide for your convenience and information. Accessing those links will cause you to leave MM’s website and may result in the collection of information about you by a third party. We do not control, endorse or make any representations about those third party websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any site you interact with before allowing the collection and use of your information.

USING THE PLATFORM FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
-------------------------------------------------

MM is headquartered in the United States of America, and we may have affiliates and service providers in the United States and other countries. Please be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated, and other locations outside of your home country. The data protection and other laws of these countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using any portion of the Platform, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
------------------

We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information online from children under the age of 16. Please contact us as provided below in the Contact Us section if you believe we may have collected such information.

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
------------------------------

This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we collect, use, and share personal information of California residents when we act as a “business” as defined under California privacy law, and their rights with respect to their personal information. For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning given under California privacy law but does not include information exempted from the scope of those laws. In some situations we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, whereby that notice will apply instead of this section.

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Platform who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com).

In addition, the state of California provides California residents with certain other rights concerning their personal information. This section describes (1) the categories of personal information, collected and disclosed by MM, subject to California privacy law, (2) your privacy rights under California privacy law, and (3) how to exercise your rights.

**Personal Information That We Collect, Use, and Disclose**

In accordance with California law, we describe:

* the categories of personal information we may have collected about you in the preceding 12 months and the categories of sources from which we collected your personal information in the section above called “Types of Personal Information We Collect”;
* the business and commercial purposes for which we collect this information in the section above called “Use of Personal Information”; and
* the categories of third parties to whom we disclose this information in the section above called “Sharing of Personal Information”.

MM must also disclose whether the following categories of personal information are disclosed for a “business purpose” or “valuable consideration” as those terms are defined under California privacy law, which also calls this latter category a “sale.” Note that while a category below may be marked, that does not necessarily mean that we have personal information in that category about you.

In the preceding twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information in the manner described:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Category** | **Personal Information is Disclosed for a Business Purpose** | **PurposePersonal Information is Disclosed for Valuable Consideration** |
| **A. Individual Identifiers and Demographic Information** | Yes | Yes |
| **B. Sensitive Personal Information** | Yes | No  |
| **C. Geolocation Data** | Yes | No  |
| **E. Sensory Data** | Yes | No  |
| **F. Biometric Information** | Yes | No  |
| **G. Commercial Information** | Yes; | No  |
| **H. Internet or Network Activity** | Yes | Yes |
| **I. Professional or Employment-Related Information** | Yes | No  |
| **J. Education Information** | Yes | No  |
| **K. Inferences Drawn from Personal Information** | Yes | No  |

 

**Your Privacy Rights Under California Law**  
Under California law, subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the following rights with respect to their personal information:

* **Access**. You have the right to request information on the categories of personal information that we collected about you in the previous 12 months, the categories of sources from which the personal information was collected, the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the business and commercial purposes for which such personal information is collected and shared, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose such personal information.
* **Erasure**. You have the right to request we delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.
* **Opt-Out of Sales**. If we “sell” your personal information, you can opt-out.
* **Non-discrimination**. California residents are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination or legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our products and services.

Please note, these rights are not absolute and in some situations we may not be able to respond to your request, such as when a legal exemption applies or if we are not able to verify your identity.

**How to Request to Exercise Your California Privacy Rights**

If you would like to exercise your rights listed above, please follow the directions below:

* **Access and Erasure Rights**. Send (or have your authorized agent send) an email to [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com) or call us toll-free at: [1-(844) 256-4550](tel:+18442564550).
* **Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information**. Under California law, some of the personal information that we share with our advertising partners may qualify as a “sale” as defined under California privacy law. To exercise your right to opt-out of such “sale”, please:
    * Email us at [contact@forthepeople.com](mailto:contact@forthepeople.com), or
    * Click here:Do Not Sell My Personal Information.

While we take measures to ensure that those responsible for receiving and responding to your request are informed of your rights and how to help you exercise those rights, when contacting us to exercise your rights, we ask you to please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Tell Us Which Right You Are Exercising:** Specify which right you want to exercise and the personal information to which your request relates (if not to you). If you are an authorized agent acting on behalf of another consumer, please clearly indicate this fact and your authority to act on such consumer’s behalf. We may require the requester’s proof of identification, the authorized agent’s proof of identification, and any other information that we may request in order to verify your request, including evidence of valid permission to act on requester’s behalf.
* **Help Us Verify Your Identity:** Provide us with information to verify your identity. Please note that if we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process. Any personal information you disclose to us for purposes of verifying your identity will solely be used for the purpose of verification.
* **Direct Our Response Delivery:** Please provide us with an e-mail or mailing address through which we can provide our response. If you make the request by email, unless otherwise requested, we will assume that we can respond to the email address from which you made the request.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee or decline to comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 45 days of your request. Occasionally it may take us longer than 45 days to respond, for instance if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this situation, we will notify you of the delay, and may continue to update you regarding the progress of our response.
