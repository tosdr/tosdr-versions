Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing herein shall be construed to confer any grant or license of any MM Intellectual Property Rights, whether by estoppel, by implication, or otherwise. You are strictly prohibited from using any MM intellectual property except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use. You are also advised that MM and its licensors will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law.

Any unauthorized use automatically terminates the license granted to you hereunder.

#### No Relationship or Obligation Arises from Use of the Site

The law differs in every jurisdiction, and you should not rely on any opinion except that of an attorney you have retained, who has a professional duty to advise you after being fully informed of all the pertinent facts, and who is licensed in the applicable state, and is familiar with the applicable law. Internet subscribers, mobile application users, and online readers should seek professional counsel about their legal rights and remedies. You should not act or refrain from acting on the basis of any information found the Site. Any actions or decisions about your legal rights should be based on the particular facts and circumstances of your situation, and appropriate legal advice from an attorney retained directly by you. MM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ACTIONS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN BASED UPON ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENTS OF THIS SITE. Viewing the Site, or communicating with MM by Internet e-mail or through the Site does not constitute or create an attorney-client relationship with anyone. The content and features on the Site do not create, and are not intended to create, an attorney-client relationship, and shall not be construed as legal advice. The content and features of the Site, including means to submit a question or information, do not constitute an offer to represent you or otherwise give rise to an attorney/client relationship.

THE SITE IS PROVIDED "AS IS”. MM MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE SITE AND ONLINE SERVICES AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, MM DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE ONLINE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

In connection therewith, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the information you hold for your account login, including your password, and for all Submissions made from your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your login. MM may suspend access to your account if it suspects illegal or improper use, or for other reasons, such as for account management purposes, at its sole discretion.

#### Confidentiality is Not Guaranteed

Information sent to Morgan & Morgan, P.A. via Internet e-mail or through the Site is not secure and is done on a non-confidential basis. MM may make reasonable efforts to keep communications private, but because of the nature of Internet communications and the absence of an attorney/client relationship, we cannot promise or guarantee confidentiality.

#### DISCLAIMER - This Site Does Not Provide Medical Diagnosis or Advice

The content provided on the Site, such as documents, text, graphics, images, videos, news alerts, pharmaceutical drug recalls, prescription medication history, or information on litigation concerning the foregoing topics, or other materials, is for informational purposes only. The information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition or for any questions you may have regarding a health concern. Never disregard professional medical advice, alter a prescription plan in anyway, or delay or refrain from seeking medical advice because of something you have read or seen on the Site. Links to other sites are provided for information only. Use of trade names is for identification only and does not constitute endorsement by MM.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Site may present information about pharmaceutical drug recalls, which is for information purposes only. Such information is not necessarily the most current information on subject and may or may not be updated based on the last information concerning such recalls. Do not make any make any decisions regarding medication or medical providers based on information from the Site including but not limited to information we provide about drug recalls.

#### MM Is Not Responsible for Content; Limitation on Liability

MM may periodically change, remove, or add the material on the Site without notice. This material may contain technical or typographical errors. MM DOES NOT GUARANTEE ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR SUITABILITY. MM assumes no liability or responsibility for any errors or omissions in the contents of the Site. Your use of the Site is at your own risk. Under no circumstances shall MM or any other party involved in the creation, production or delivery of the Site be liable to you or any other person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind arising from your access to, or use of, the Site. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN NO EVENT SHALL MM BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS MATERIAL, FOR ANY USE OF THIS WEBSITE, OR FOR ANY OTHER LINKED WEBSITE.

#### Third-party Web Sites

The Site contains links to third party web sites for the convenience of our users. MM does not endorse any of these third party sites and does not imply any association between MM and those sites. MM does not control these third party web sites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with these Terms of Use. If you use links to access and use such web sites, you do so at your own risk. MM is not responsible for the contents or availability of any linked sites. These links are provided only as a convenience to the recipient. These Terms only apply to the Site and do not apply to any linked sites. We encourage you to read and understand the terms of use of any linked sites that you visit. Links do not imply that we sponsor, endorse, are affiliated with or associated with, or are legally authorized to use any trademark, trade name, service mark, design, logo, symbol, or other copyrighted materials displayed on or accessible through any linked site.

#### State Laws Vary

MM has lawyers that are licensed to practice law in all 50 states and Washington DC. MM may refer prospective clients to other law firms located throughout the country, who form relationships with MM, and are experienced in handling such cases. MM may also undertake legal representation in certain cases, and will affiliate with other legal counsel located throughout the country to provide legal representation. The laws of each State are different. The Site contains information about general or common rules that apply in some states. The Site also contains information about verdicts or settlements in past cases. You cannot assume that the same rules apply, or that the same result would occur, in your state or any particular state. The Statute of Limitations is especially important. Every state has laws called the “statute of limitations” which set a deadline to file a lawsuit. That means that a lawsuit filed too late may be thrown out, regardless of the defendant’s fault or the severity of the injuries. Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims; the time period in other states may be longer or shorter. Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss. Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months. Because investigation and research is needed to identify all possible defendants and theories of recovery, if you have an accident or injury, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible.

#### MM Clients

Only individuals who have entered into a mutually signed retainer agreement with MM are MM clients (“MM Clients”). Certain portions of the Site designated as such by MM, such as the “My Case” feature of the mobile application, may be available for use only by MM Clients. When MM Clients use such portions of the Site designated by MM to communicate with us pursuant to our representation of a MM Client, we will ensure that any information provided pursuant to such attorney/client relationship may not be shared with third parties except as is done with such precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the relevant information and any attorney/client privilege as may attach to such information. MM takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect the information that we collect.

#### Legal and Ethical Requirements

MM has tried to comply with all legal and ethical requirements in compiling the Site. We welcome comments about our compliance with the applicable rules and will update the Site as warranted, upon learning of any new or different requirements. To the extent that the professional responsibility rules of any jurisdiction require us to designate a principal office or an attorney responsible for the Site, Morgan & Morgan, P.A. designates its office in Orlando, Florida (USA), 20 North Orange Avenue, Suite 1600, and attorney Alexander Clem.

#### Advertising Disclosures

Some materials on the Platform may constitute lawyer advertising. The choice of a lawyer is an important decision, and it should never be based solely upon an advertisement. Before making your choice of any attorney, you should give this matter careful thought. The selection of an attorney is an important decision. Cases will be handled by attorneys licensed in the local jurisdiction.. Before you decide, you may ask us to send you free written information about our qualifications and experience. FREE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST. No representation is made that the lawyers are certified specialists or experts in any field of law. And no representation is made that the legal services to be performed are greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Anyone considering a lawyer should independently investigate the lawyer’s credentials and ability, and not rely upon advertisements or self-proclaimed expertise. No representation is made here about your specific rights. Every case is different and must be judged on its own merits. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome. Contingent attorney fees are negotiable and not set by law. Costs and fees are charged only upon monetary recovery. Not available in all states. Cases may be handled in association with, or referred to, other law firms as co-counsel or referral counsel.

Arbitration will be the sole means of resolving such controversies, disputes and claims, and you waive your rights to resolve such controversies, disputes and claims by court proceedings or any other means. You agree that judgment may be entered on the award in any court of competent jurisdiction and, therefore, any award rendered shall be binding. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. **You understand that by agreeing to arbitration as a mechanism to resolve all controversies, disputes and claims between us, you are waiving certain rights, including the right to bring an action in court, the right to a jury trial, the right to broad discovery, and the right to an appeal. You understand that in the context of arbitration, a case is decided by an arbitrator (one or more), not by a judge or a jury.**

MM’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent or similar breaches. No consent or waiver by MM hereof will be deemed effective unless in writing. These Terms of Use, together with our Privacy Policy, as each is currently posted, constitute the entire agreement between MM and you with respect to your use of the Site and supersede all previous written or oral agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, except that this agreement shall not supersede, restrict, or replace any agreements governing the attorney-client relationship between MM and MM Clients.
