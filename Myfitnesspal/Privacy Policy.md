Social Sharing Settings
-----------------------

Within our Services there are four sharing settings: Private, Public, Friends Only, and Locked with a Key. MyFitnessPal is designed to help you along your fitness and wellness journey. As such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you share it. We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level. In the interest of safeguarding your Personal Data, we have outlined some initial default sharing settings.

### Default Sharing Settings

* **“Physical Stats,”** **“Diary”** and **“Community Social Data”** are set as **Private.** “Private” means not shared with friends or other members. You can change this default status for some of your physical stats. Information that is “Private” by default includes, for example, your height, weight and BMI.
    
* **“Activity”** is set as  **Friends Only.** “Friends Only” means visible to your friends in their news feed, but not shared with other members. You can change this default status if you want. Information that is set as “Friends Only” by default includes, for example, your friendships, news feed comments, completed food diaries, and workouts completed.
    
* **“Forum Posts”** are **Public.** “Public” means visible to all others using the service.
    
* **Lookup Information** **(“Let my friends find me”** and **“Profile”**) are set as Public. **“Let my friends find me”** allows people to see that you are on MyFitnessPal and easily add you as a friend (i.e., your account is discoverable by email address). We believe that social motivation helps you achieve your goals faster and allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial to this experience. **“Profile”** information and picture is visible only to MyFitnessPal members who are logged in (age is Private on a member’s profile by default). If you set your entire account as Private, your lookup information will no longer be available for your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire within the Services).
    

### Changing Your Sharing Preferences

Details on how to update your sharing preferences and the default settings for our Services are outlined within the [sharing standard](https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032273872-How-do-I-make-my-diary-visible-to-other-users).

**Note:** When you share information from our Services externally with a SNS, the information you post is governed by their privacy policy and settings.

Our advertising practices also include the creation and use of “audience segments.” You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. Depending on where you access our website from, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies.

These websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works.

Collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work.

We provide you several ways to manage your preferences:

### Cookie Use and Controls

Cookies serve a wide variety of purposes. Cookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users. Cookies are used to personalize your web experience and for security, analytics, marketing, and interest-based advertising. Our cookies are placed and read by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by other companies’ web servers. Information on specific cookies is found on our website via the adchoices link. You can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section. If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our Website will not work.

One way to think about cookies is based on their function. The following settings will control our use of browser cookies, the use of IP address for tracking, and the collection and use of data for cookie-based, interest-based advertising.

\[ IN \] **Required Cookies.** These strictly necessary cookies are used for core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, are necessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences. Without these cookies, some functionality on our Website may fail. You can block these cookies in your browser preferences.

\[ IN / OUT \] **Functional Cookies.** These cookies help to improve the Website by allowing us to understand how the Website is used and how the Website performs. These cookies include analytics and measurement.

\[ IN / OUT \] **Advertising Cookies.** These cookies help us and other parties personalize ads that are shown to you on the Services, as well as on other websites. If enabled, these cookies will allow third parties engaged in interest-based advertising on our Website to recognize your browser software on other websites too.

### IP Address Use

An IP address refers to an identifier assigned by a network to a computer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing device. IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include “public” IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is visible to the Internet, as well as “local” IP addresses, which are IP addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices “behind” a router (such as a home router). Our advertising and analytics partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.

You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising or analytics by using the cookie controls for “Advertising Cookies,” and “Performance/Analytics,” above.

### Web Pixels or Beacons Use

Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request. Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.

### HTML5 Local Storage

HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5 Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.

### Social Network Interaction and Widgets

Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Website passively transmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow a social network (e.g., Facebook) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited. This is true wherever social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is “clicked” or “pressed.” If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.

### Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use

Our Services may transmit Device IDs, general location data, and data from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners.

* _Device IDs_ include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI; platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple’s IDFA; and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system.
    
* _General Location Data_. Our Services may transmit general location data. General location data may be obtained from GPS services, cell tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points.
    
* _Sensor and In-Range Device Data_. Our apps and Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi Access Points.
    
* _How We Use Mobile Device Data_. We may use Device IDs, coarse location and general location data, and data from sensors, including the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes; improving our apps and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app, cross-device, interest-based advertising.
    

### Withdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs for Analytics and Advertising

Activating the “Limit Ad Tracking,” “Opt out of Ads Personalization,” or equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to us and any third parties that we use. When that signal is received by MyFitnessPal or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have Device IDs used for purposes of advertising or analytics. We honor the signal and require that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same.

To the extent our App personalizes functionality for you, you can change these settings within the App, or reset to defaults by deleting and reinstalling the App.

### Change Consent Settings for Communication Preferences

**Consent for Email Communication:** After signing up for email communications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link in any commercial email we send. Please note that if you unsubscribe from “all emails” this means “all emails other than strictly necessary emails.” You will still receive email communications from us if they are strictly necessary to provide the Services or to confirm or validate a transaction, recover accounts, etc.

**Mobile Push Notifications:** You can manage the type of push notifications you receive from MyFitnessPal by modifying the settings within the App. For more information on how to update your push notification settings for our Services please visit [here](https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032623051-How-do-I-set-up-push-notifications-).

_Residents of California_

If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights to the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under California law, the exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., maintaining confidentially when legally required ). We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Requests to exercise your rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and applicable law. To prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Data, we take steps to verify an individual’s right to the data - including requiring users to reach out to us directly from a verified email address, pass a challenge response, and/or confirm information associated with the account. Following verification of your identity, we will notify you if we are unable to fulfill your request and outline the reasons we are unable to honor your request at this time.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

You have the following rights:

* **Right of Access to Your Personal Data:** You have the right to ask us for confirmation on whether we are processing your Personal Data, and access to the Personal Data, as permitted by law. This may include what Personal Data we collect, use, or disclose about you.
    
* **Right to Deletion:** You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data, as permitted by law.
    
* **Right to Opt-out of “Sale” and Certain Sharing Practices:** You have the right to opt-out of certain data sharing practices with third parties who may use your Personal Data solely for their own purposes. Your right to opt-out is limited to information we “sell” to these third parties. “Sell” in this case does not mean providing data in exchange for money – _we don’t do that._ “Sell” instead means the disclosure of data, including technical device data that does not identify you directly, when a third party might use that data for its own purposes, such as for personalized advertising. We do not have actual knowledge that we sell personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
    
* **Right to Non-Discrimination:** We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you submit one of the rights requests listed above.

**Exercise your opt-out of “sale” rights:** For instructions on how to exercise your rights, please visit our “[do not sell my personal information](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/data-usage)” page.

**Additional California Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for that third party’s direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.

Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If we do decide to share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this disclosure at any time by submitting a request to our [support team](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/contact-us), or in writing to:

MyFitnessPal, Inc.  
ATTN: Privacy/Legal
