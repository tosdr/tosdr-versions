**Effective as of January 1, 2020**

This California privacy notice is in response to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning in this California privacy notice.

We will note that below.

### Rights and Choices of California Residents

The CCPA provides certain California residents with rights about their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. **Please note that certain California residents will not have these rights to the extent their personal information is "excluded personal information" as described above.** **The CCPA does not provide these rights to B2B personal information.**

#### California Residents' Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights

You have the right to request that the Company disclose certain information to you about our collection of your personal information over the past 12 months. First, we must verify the identity of the consumer making the request. After verification, we will disclose to you (based on your request):

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
* The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.
* The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
* The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (which allows you to port or copy your data).
* Two separate lists disclosing:
    * that we did not sell your personal information; and
    * the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

#### Deletion Request Rights of California Residents

California residents have the right to request that we delete any of their personal information that we collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions. First, we will verify your identity. After we verify your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. You must contact the applicable schools directly to delete your information that they have in their systems.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

1. Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
2. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
3. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
4. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law.
5. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
6. Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement if you previously provided informed consent.
7. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
8. Comply with a legal obligation.
9. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

We may also limit our deletion to the extent permitted by applicable law.

#### How California Residents can Exercise Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

* Filling out our web form on the Contact Us page and selecting "deletion request" or "access and portability request" in the drop-down menu ([_https://www.registerednursing.org/contact-us/_](https://www.registerednursing.org/contact-us/)).
* Sending an email to _privacy at esyoh dot com_ (at means @ and dot means .),
* Sending us a request at our physical address:

ESYOH, LLC  
Attention: Privacy  
30 N. Gould Street, Suite 25007  
Sheridan, WY 82801

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability **twice** within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collect personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

#### Timing of our Respond and the Format

We will try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of our receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We will deliver our response to you either via email or mail.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to copy and transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### Non-Discrimination against California Residents

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that **can result** in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value to the Company and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time. Currently, we do not provide any financial incentives to our users.
