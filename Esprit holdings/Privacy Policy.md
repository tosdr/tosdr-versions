B. Data processing activities
-----------------------------

### I. Provision of the website

### 1\. Description and extent of the data processing

With the mere informational use of our website, thus if you do not register or transmit information to us in any other manner, we will only collect the personal data, which your browser transmits to our server when calling our website:  
  
• IP address (if applicable in anonymised, abbreviated form)  
• Date and time of the enquiry,  
• Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT),  
• Content of the requirement (concrete site),  
• Access status/HTTP status code,  
• Respectively transmitted data volume,  
• Website, from which the requirement comes,  
• Browser type,  
• Operating system and its interface,  
• Language and version of the browser software.  
  
The data are also stored in the logfiles of our system. A storage of these data together with other personal data of the user will not take place. The anonymous data of the server logfiles are stored separately from all personal data entered by a relevant person.

### 2\. Legal basis for the data processing

The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

### 3\. Purpose of the data processing

If you would like to view our website, we will collect the data stated under 1. as they are necessary from a technical point of view in order to display our website to you and to guarantee the stability and security of the system. The storage in logfiles is carried out in order to ensure the functionality of the website. Moreover, the data serve us to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our IT systems. Our legitimate interest in the data processing is also based in these purposes according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

### 4\. Duration of the storage

The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the achievement of the purpose of their collection. In the event of the entry of the data for the provision of the website, this is the case if the respective session is ended, i.e. if you leave our website.  
  
This is the case at the latest after seven days in case of the storage in log files. A storage that exceeds the above is not possible. The IP addresses of the users will be deleted or changed in this case, which means that an allocation of the connected client is no longer possible.

### 5\. Possibility to file an objection and remedy

The entry of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in logfiles is absolutely essential for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility to file an objection on the part of the user.

### II. Use of cookies

### 1\. Description and scope of the data processing

We would also like to design our services as individually as possible in the future and consistently improve these in order to be able to offer interesting information an attractive shopping experience for you. Therefore, we partly use cookies. Cookies are small text files, which are stored on your hard disk drive allocated to the browser used by you and by which the body, which sets the cookie (here by us), receives certain information. Such a cookie contains a characteristic string, which enables a clear identification of the browser when the website is accessed once again. Cookies cannot carry out any programmes or transmit viruses to your computer. We use cookies in order to design our website more user-friendly. If you would not like to receive any cookies, you can configure this accordingly via the settings of your internet browser. However, please pay attention that certain cookies are necessary in order to use all functions of our website.  
  
We use both so-called session cookies, which are only in use for the duration of an online visit, as well as those, which are used in the long term. Long-term cookies are in particular used in order to be able to make permanent recurring settings available to you as customers in the Esprit Online-Shop, such as for example individual information coordinated to you in order to improve the comfort and to be able to present offers to you that are coordinated to your previous purchasing behaviour.  
We use the following types of cookies, the scope and functionality of which are explained below:  
  
• Transient cookies (e.g. session cookies) (see in this respect a)  
• Persistent cookies (see in this respect b).

### a) Transient cookies

Transient cookies—which in particular include so-called session cookies—are as a rule deleted automatically if you close the browser or a session has expired. These cookies store a so-called session ID, with which various enquiries of your browser can be allocated to the joint session. In this way, your computer can be recognised again if you return to our website. The session cookies are as a rule deleted when you log out or close the browser. The following data are stored and transmitted in Session cookies:  
  
• Language and country settings  
• Screen resolution

### b) Persistent cookies

Persistent cookies are deleted automatically after a stipulated duration, which can make a distinction depending on the cookie. You can delete or deactivate the cookies in the security settings of your browser at all times as determined by you. For the design suitable for the needs as well as for the optimisation of our websites, data are entered and stored as well as usage profiles are created from these data by using pseudonyms. Usage profiles are, however, not aggregated with the data about the holder of the pseudonym without the explicit consent of the visitor. When accessing our website, the users are informed by an information banner about the use of cookies for analysis purposes and referred to this privacy statement.  
  
Persistent cookies used by Esprit:

### b1) Webtrekk

We use a cookie of the company Webtrekk GmbH, Robert-Koch-Platz 4, 10115 Berlin, Germany in order to analyse and evaluate customer usage behaviour on our website.  
  
You can object to this data entry and storage at all times with effect for the future. Please call the following link.   
for this purpose. By confirming the link, a so-called opt-out cookie will be set on your computer. This cookie has a validity of 5 years. Please note that if all cookies on your computer are deleted, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted, i.e. if you continue to intend to object to the data collection using a pseudonym by Webtrekk, you must set the opt-out cookie once again. The opt-out cookie is set per browser and computer. If you visit our websites from your home and from your workplace or by using various browsers, you must activate the opt-out cookie on the various browsers or on the various computers.

### 2\. Legal basis for the data processing

The legal basis for the processing of personal data by using cookies is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

### 3\. Purpose of the data processing

Transient cookies are used for the purpose of simplifying the use of our website for the individual user. Several functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For this it is necessary that the browser is also recognised again after a change in site. Transient cookies are therefore used for example for the language and country settings.  
  
The use of persistent analysis-cookies is carried out for the purpose to improve the quality of our website and its contents. By the analysis-cookies we find out how the website is used and can so therefore consistently optimise our offer.  
  
Without your consent a collection of analysis data is merely carried out in an anonymised or pseudonymised form. We cannot recognise your identity hereby. Therefore, our legitimate interest in the processing of the personal data is also constituted in these purposes according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

### 4\. Duration of the storage, possibilities for objection and remedy

Cookies are stored on your computer and transmitted by this computer to our website. Therefore, you have as user also the full control over the use of cookies. By a change in the settings in your internet browser you can deactivate or limit the transmission of cookies. Already stored cookies can always be deleted. This can also be carried out automatically.  
  
Please note that you can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and can make individual decisions about their acceptance or you can exclude the acceptance of cookies generally or for certain cases. Each browser differs in the type, how it manages the cookie-settings. This is described in the help menu of each browser, it is explained to you how you can change your cookie-settings. You will find these for the respective browser under the following links:

D. Other
--------

### I. Existence of an automated decision-making in an individual case (including profiling)

We do not use any purely automated decision-making processes pursuant to Article 22 GDPR. If we should intend to us such a process in future in individual cases after all we will inform you hereof separately if this is stipulated by law.

### II. Scope of your obligations to make your data available to us

You only need to make those data available, which are necessary for the commencement and execution of the contractual relationship or for a pre-contractual relationship with us or which we are obliged to collect by law. Without these data we will as a rule not be in the position to conclude the contract or to continue to carry this out. This may also refer to data that are subsequently required within the scope of the contractual relationship. If we additionally receive data from you you will be informed about the voluntary nature of the details separately.

### III. Forwarding to third parties

Esprit can only access your data as is required to achieve the purposes in accordance with the internal division of tasks. To this end, only those departments and employees who are required to access your data will be granted access to this data internally.  
  
Service providers: We have involved service providers that have access to your data in their capacity as a contract processor, and who process this data for the purposes specifically defined by us. These contract processors may be marketing services providers, website hosting service providers, IT support services providers, technical service providers (stock exchange price) or website analysis service providers.  
  
Other third parties: We may also be required to forward certain data to third parties in cases where this is required by law or under the legislation. Such parties may include government authorities, external advisors, business partners, courts, experts as well as internal company committees and control instances, if required.  
  
International data transmission: Even though all recipients are currently based in the EU/EEA, it is possible that in the future recipients may be based in a country outside of the EU/EEA that does not offer a standard of data privacy that is comparable to the European data privacy standard. In particular, such service providers may be located in the US in the future. In this case, Esprit will either select service providers that have been certified under the US-EU Privacy Shield Program (Art. 45 para. 1 GDPR), or that arrange the EU standard contract clauses, such as those approved by the EU Commission, with Esprit (Art. 46 para. 2 (c) or (d) GDPR).
