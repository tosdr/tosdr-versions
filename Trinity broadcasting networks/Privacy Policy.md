Trinity Broadcasting Networks Online Privacy Policy
---------------------------------------------------

TBN realizes that you are concerned about how information you may give us is used and shared. In this regard, TBN is committed to maintaining your trust and confidence as well as to provide you with the best possible experience while visiting our website. Thus, TBN provides this online privacy policy to make sure you are aware of our security practices and to inform you of the way your personal information is collected, used and protected so that you will feel secure while visiting our website. By visiting our website, you are accepting our privacy policy and the practices described herein. Should you not agree, we also provide you with the opportunity to remove your personal information from our website.

What personal information TBN collects from you?
------------------------------------------------

The online information that we collect includes name, address, city, state, zip, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of online giving, credit card number and expiration date. In order to continuously improve your service and tailor our subsequent communications to you, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information regarding your demographics, comments, personal interests, and contact preferences.

How TBN collects personal information from you?
-----------------------------------------------

There are four different ways we collect information from visitors on our Web site: 1. From online requests for information (i.e. e-mail newsletters, contact forms, request forms, etc.); 2. From online requests for materials from our organizations (i.e. requesting a free offer, or for prayer); 3. From online donations; and 4. product purchases. We also collect information you provide during our video on demand app registration which references this privacy policy.  
You may choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, improving our website, television program and other services, matching your partner information with your community profile, and communicating with you.

During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

How your personal information is used by TBN?
---------------------------------------------

TBN uses your personal information to understand your needs and provide you with better service. We may use your information to complete a transaction, issue you an income tax receipt for a donation, or to personalize our Web site for you. We may also use this information to update you on ministry projects and activities. When we do, you will always be provided with the option to opt out of future updates. Credit card information is used only for donation or payment processing and are not retained for any other purposes.  
 

TBN does not and will not sell your personal information
--------------------------------------------------------

TBN never sells, rents, or leases your personal information with other organizations. Use of personal information is limited to TBN, its affiliates, or vendors contracted by us to perform services in support of our ministry. From time to time, we may send you special offers from our programming partners. When we do, you will always be provided with the option to opt out of future offers. Should TBN be compelled by operation of law to disclose your information to law enforcement or other third parties we will notify you prior to complying with any such order.
