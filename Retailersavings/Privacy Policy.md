A cookie is placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use cookies for tracking transactions and the user characteristics explained in detail throughout this Privacy Policy. If you choose, there are utilities available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose through most web browsers to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more satisfying website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.<br>    <br>    We may also add third party cookies. Cookies contain anonymous, segmented data about a user’s demographics (like age, gender, and location), interests, lifestyle, household details, social media memberships, and online influences. The data in the cookies may also contain individual-specific information relating to web browsing and app activity.<br>    <br>    We also collect information through our web server applications. This information includes your Internet Protocol or “IP” address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.<br>    <br>    Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion of transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.<br>    <br>    **Government Forms**<br>    <br>    The Company may be required to create, collect, maintain, and submit certain information required by the government, such as IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer identification number, will not be used, shared, transferred, or sold for marketing purposes.<br>    <br>    **HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?**<br>    <br>    We may use the collected PII and Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including but not limited to those explained below.<br>    <br>    **Ad Serving**<br>    <br>    We may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on your IP address, the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the website registration process, and other socio-economic information, psychographic information, Internet behavior (i.e., browsing, search, shopping, purchase, and ad response behavior), and lifestyle information about you that we obtain from other Company entities and from third parties.<br>    <br>    We also use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our websites. These companies may use and optimize information (not including your name, mailing address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.<br>    <br>    **Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers**<br>    <br>    Our website technology may pre-select certain offers for you to view based on the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the Company during the website registration process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some or all of the offers’ data fields with the information you submitted during the website registration process in order to prevent you from having to re-enter this information. We may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.<br>    <br>    **Upsell**<br>    <br>    We utilize customized post transactional or "upsell" technology to help advertisers generate sales, while providing you with a series of great offers we think may be of interest to you. The way it works is simple: once you purchase a product or service from one of our reward advertisers, you will be offered additional products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you elect to purchase products or services from a third party advertiser in the post transactional channel, please input all necessary information on the subsequent advertiser form, including, but not limited to, your credit card information. You need to complete this information because we do not pass this information to the third party advertiser.<br>    <br>    **Customer Service and Fulfillment**<br>    <br>    We may use your information to operate the website promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through Company websites.

We do retain customer service correspondence.<br>    <br>    **Credit Card Preauthorization**<br>    <br>    By submitting your credit card information to us or to one of our advertisers, you are authorizing the Company or its agent to periodically verify that your credit card account is valid and has credit available by charging, and thereafter crediting, a small sum to the card.<br>    <br>    **Marketing**<br>    <br>    We may use your information in our online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. With respect to telemarketing in particular, you authorize us and our third-party marketing partners to call your landline telephone and/or cell phone (if provided) by providing "prior express consent".

These should be obvious in the context of the offering at the time you sign up. By signing up, you are agreeing to receive these mobile offerings. You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages. To unsubscribe or discontinue SMS messages, send "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received.

This will not affect offerings sent on behalf of third parties.<br>    <br>    **IVR**<br>    <br>    Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this website constitutes your express written consent to receive telemarketing calls from third-party marketers, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice dialing.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to affiliated companies and their collection, use and sharing of information. With respect to online behavioral advertising, certain affiliated companies may use non-personally identifiable information (which may or may not include click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) collected during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

You can unsubscribe from these job alerts at any time. We will share your email address and job-related preferences with the vendor that we use to send you email job alerts.<br>    <br>    When you select “yes” next to an offer, we will transfer some or all of the information that you submitted during the website registration process to the applicable advertiser without providing you with another opportunity to review the information.<br>    <br>    **Ad Serving Companies**<br>    <br>    We may use third party ad networks or ad serving companies to serve advertisements on our websites.

The information passed to these companies may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and any other information you provide to us. Web pages that are served by these companies will state that they are “powered by” or “ads by” the applicable company and will contain a link to that company’s privacy policy.<br>    <br>    **Marketing Partners**<br>    <br>    We may share, license or sell your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including their online (e.g., e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs.

These third parties use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.<br>    <br>    **Governmental Agencies or Other Companies**<br>    <br>    We may share your information with law enforcement officials or governmental agencies: (1) in response to their request; (2) when permitted or required by law; or (3) to establish our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or guidelines.<br>    <br>    We may store and share your information with third parties for suppression or opt-out purposes.<br>    <br>    We also may share your information with third parties when: (1) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; (2) investigating fraud that has already taken place; (3) enforcing or applying existing terms and conditions and/or other agreements; (4) protecting the rights, property or safety of our websites, our users or others; or (5) responding to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.<br>    <br>    In all cases, this information is not provided to these entities or persons for marketing purposes.<br>    <br>    **Right to Transfer**<br>    <br>    Should the Company choose to sell or transfer business assets, it is possible that the information we possess may be transferred as part of that transaction.
