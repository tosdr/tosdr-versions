13\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms of Service and the relationship between you and AMG are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

14\. Class Action Waiver and Binding Arbitration

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CLAIMS HEARD BY A JURY.

ANY ARBITRATION AWARD PURSUANT TO THIS PROVISION IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT ONLY TO LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT INCLUDING LIMITED RIGHTS TO APPEAL THE ARBITRATION AWARD.

14.1 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND AMG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND AMG EXPRESSLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AGAINST AMG AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED DOES NOT ENTITLE OTHER AMG USERS TO SIMILAR RELIEF. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision in these Terms shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

14.2 Agreement to Arbitrate

This Section 14 is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement”. By installing a Product and/or using the Products, Sites and Services, you agree that all claims relating to or arising out of the Products, Sites and Services or these Terms or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise that have arisen or may arise between you and AMG or its parent company and affiliates, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

14.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

AMG is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. You and AMG agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve claims and disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and AMG therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), you and AMG will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any claim or dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give written notice to the other party of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to AMG that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to Ask Media Group, LLC., Attn: Legal Department, 1955 Broadway, Suite 350, Oakland, CA 94612. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address ; (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of counsel, if any; and (3) a detailed description of your claim together with substantiation of the facts on which you base your claim.

In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s claim. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.

14.4 Arbitration Procedures

If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice, you and AMG agree that the claim or dispute shall be finally resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (collectively referred to as the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and excluding the JAMS Class Action Procedures. For information on JAMS, please visit its website available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/](https://www.jamsadr.com/). Information about JAMS’s Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the JAMS consumer arbitration page available at [https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/). If there is any inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 9 of these Terms.

If your claim has not been resolved through the Dispute Resolution Conference, you may commence an arbitration against AMG by writing a demand for arbitration that includes: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. You can find a sample Demand for Arbitration at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). You should send three copies of the Demand, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS at Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111, and send one copy to AMG, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1955 Broadway, Suite 350 Oakland, CA 94612. For more information, see the JAMS arbitration rules and forms, [https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/). You may represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.

The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less you or AMG may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and AMG subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or AMG, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise and all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users of Products, Services and Sites.

The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from JAMS’ roster of arbitrators with experience in consumer and/or internet industry disputes. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) days of delivery of the Demand, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the applicable JAMS rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process is triggered, JAMS will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.

14.5 Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. Each party will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse AMG for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by AMG.

14.6 Confidentiality

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

14.7 Limited Rights to Appeal

Once the arbitrator has rendered their award, it is binding on the parties and it is not possible to appeal an arbitration award to a court on the usual appellate grounds under federal or state laws. Under JAMS Rules, there are only very narrow grounds on which parties may appeal an arbitration award.

14.8 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and AMG agree that if AMG makes any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, such change shall not be effective until at least 60 days from the date of posting, and shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against AMG prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration Agreement from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the publication of the version of these Terms removing the Arbitration Agreement on the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against AMG prior to the effective date of removal.

15\. Severability of These Terms of Service

If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, the remaining provisions contained in these Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.

16\. Limitation of Actions Brought Against AMG

You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of the Sites, Products or Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by AMG to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms of Service or any related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

17\. Third Party Beneficiaries

You agree that, except for AMG and as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms of Service, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this agreement.

18\. Section Titles

The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

19\. Ask Media Group Transparency Policy

At Ask Media Group, we understand the importance of balancing individual privacy rights with the public's right to information. Our policies are designed to respect and protect user data while maintaining transparency and accountability in our search engine operations.

Search Result Sources and Advertisement Transparency

* Source of Search Results: Our search results are primarily derived from third-party providers such as Google and Bing. Additionally, we include content from websites owned and operated by Ask Media Group, as well as our affiliates and content partners. In certain websites, search results only include content from Ask Media Group owned and operated websites.
* Advertisements: We collaborate with advertising partners like Google and Microsoft to display relevant advertisements. We also display programmatic advertisements sourced from various programmatic advertising partners. All sponsored search results and display ads are clearly labelled as "Sponsored" or quot;Advertisement" for easy identification. Please see our Privacy Policy for information on data collected by such advertising partners about you and your privacy choices.

Right to be Forgotten (RTBF) requests

* Overview: In compliance with GDPR and the EU Digital Services Act, individuals may request the removal of certain search results linked to their personal information.
