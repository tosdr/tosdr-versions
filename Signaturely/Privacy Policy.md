Privacy Policy
==============

Last modified: July 15, 2021

This Privacy Policy details how Signaturely, LLC (“Signaturely”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) collects, uses, discloses and secures personal information:

* When you visit or interact with our website at www.signaturely.com (“Site”);
* From our customers (“Customers”) who sign up for and use our products and services (“Services”) and
* When you otherwise communicate with us, such as through email or via social media platforms.

If, after reviewing this Privacy Policy, you have any questions or concerns, please send us an email to [\[email protected\]](https://signaturely.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL LOCATED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA OR THE UNITED KINGDOM:** If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (U.K.), this entire Privacy Policy applies to you. In addition, please see [Additional Information for Individuals in the EEA and the U.K.](#individuals-uk) below, which also applies to you and will inform you in detail about our legal bases for processing and which rights you have in connection with our processing of your personal information.

**IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEVADA:** If you are a resident of Nevada, this entire Privacy Policy applies to you. However, please see [Notice for Nevada Consumers](#nevada) below, which will also apply to you.

Signaturely is a California limited liability company with the following contact information:

Signaturely, LLC  
440 N Barranca Ave Ste 1760  
Covina, CA 91723  
United States

With respect to its collection and processing of personal information, Signaturely acts as either a:

* ‘Data controller’ when it collects personal information on its own behalf and for its own commercial and business purposes, such as from Site visitors or to register Customers, or
* ‘Data processor’ when it collects and processes personal information on behalf of its Customers in order to provide the Services.

Please note that how you exercise certain rights will depend on whether Signaturely is processing your personal information as a ‘data controller’ or as a ‘data processor’ – as further explained throughout this Privacy Policy.

**How to Contact Us about Privacy**

Any questions about this Privacy Policy or requests for access to or deletion or rectification of personal information that Signaturely collects and processes should be addressed to [\[email protected\]](https://signaturely.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by mail at:

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

Signaturely may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, in its sole discretion. If we do so, we will post an updated Privacy Policy on the Site along with a change notice. Changes, modifications, additions, or deletions will be effective immediately upon their posting to the Site unless otherwise stated in the change notice. If we make material or significant changes, we may also send registered Customers a notice that this Privacy Policy has been changed. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services, and/or your continued provision of personal information to us after the posting of such notice, will be deemed an acceptance of any changes and subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

International Transfers
-----------------------

We are located in the United States, and the personal information that we collect is stored on servers hosted by us or our authorized third-party service providers located in the United States. This means that your personal information will be collected, processed, and stored in the United States, which may have data protection laws that are different from (and sometimes less protective than) the laws of your country or region, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).

**By sending us personal information, you agree and consent to the processing of your personal information on servers located in the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other regions (particularly the European Union or the U.K.).**

We have implemented safeguards designed to ensure that the personal information we process remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including when processed internationally or by our third-party service providers and partners. The safeguards we may take in our discretion include, for instance, entering into specific agreements in connection with any onward transfers of personal information. We may implement other mechanisms and take similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners. Further details can be provided upon request.

Alternatively, we may sell businesses or business units, merge with other entities, obtain financing, and/or sell assets or stock, in some cases, as part of a reorganization or liquidation in bankruptcy. In order to evaluate and/or as part of these transactions, we may transfer your personal information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation, or other corporate reorganization in which Signaturely participates, to investors and/or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or a portion of Signaturely’s assets, including bankruptcy.

Signaturely may preserve or disclose your personal information in limited circumstances (other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy), including: (i) with your consent; (ii) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a valid subpoena, warrant, or other judicial or administrative order (as further explained below); (iii) to protect the safety of any person; (iv) to protect the safety or security of the Site and/or Services or to prevent spam, abuse, or other malicious activity of actors with respect to the Site and/or Services; or (v) to protect our rights or property and/or the rights or property of those who use the Site and/or Services.

If we are required to disclose personal information by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other judicial or administrative order, we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of this disclosure requirement, unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute, subpoena or court or administrative order. Our policy is to respond to requests that are properly issued by law enforcement within the United States or via mutual legal assistance mechanism (such as a treaty), and to object to requests that we do not believe were issued properly. However, if we receive information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, we may provide information to law enforcement trying to prevent or mitigate the danger (if we have it), which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

With respect to Services Data, Customers must review our [Terms of Use](https://signaturely.com/terms/), which address our retention and disclosure of information if required by law.

We do not knowingly collect any personal information directly from children under the age of 16.

If you believe that we have any personal information from or about anyone under the age of 16, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://signaturely.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Analytics
---------

### Google Analytics

The Site uses third-party analytics tools that drop cookies and/or similar technologies to collect and store information about your device and use of the Site. We use analytics tools to calculate visitor, session and campaign data for analytics reports.

### Hotjar

We use Hotjar, a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our Site with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our Site visitors’ behavior and their devices. This includes Device Information, Usage Information and Location Information.

Marketing & Advertising
-----------------------

### Direct Marketing

We market and advertise our company and Services in a variety of ways. We may gather information from or about you in the following different roles:

* Individuals who have no relationship with Signaturely, meaning that Signaturely has acquired data about them through a third party (“Leads”) or they have visited the Site, in some cases because our service providers suggest our Site and Services
* Individuals, entities or others who have contacted Signaturely or otherwise inquired about Signaturely’s Services
* Customers
* Contacts who visit our Site, including after signing a document or otherwise completing a task requested by a Customer.

In some cases, you provide personal information directly to Signaturely as part of a marketing event that Signaturely hosts or co-hosts, such as when you attend an event, through email or when you schedule a demo. Occasionally, and in some cases only with your consent, we may send you future communications. We may also acquire personal information about you when you visit our Site or Social Media Accounts (see [below](#social-media)).

Customers have the option to register for a free account and access some of our Services free of charge. If you register for a free account – for instance if you’d like to try it out first – we will send you marketing communications about upgrading to the paid Services. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, click the ‘unsubscribe’ link contained in the corresponding emails, or contact us using the contact details provided above.

Our communications to you for marketing purposes will contain instructions on how you can opt-out from receiving future communications, and if you consent to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes, you may always withdraw your consent. You may also directly contact Signaturely about its marketing activities at [\[email protected\]](https://signaturely.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### Targeted Advertising

Signaturely engages third-party advertising networks (“External Ad Partners”) to display advertising about our Services when you visit other websites within that advertising network. Like many other companies, we rely on retargeting, also known as remarketing, which is a type of marketing strategy that helps businesses “remind” visitors of their products and services after they leave their websites. For instance, through the use of cookies (and similar technologies) placed by External Ad Partners, Device Information, Usage Information and Location Information (as explained [above](#ad-partners)) are collected and then used to identify visitors to our Site on other websites or social media platforms. With this information, our External Ad Partners may serve relevant ads on consumers who previously visited the Site.

Please note that with respect to advertising, our External Ad Partners share the information that they collect on our Site with many other companies within the advertising supply chain. Signaturely does not have a direct relationship with these other companies.

To learn more about advertising cookies are, how they are used, and how to opt-out, please review our Cookie Statement .

Individuals in the EEA and the U.K. have additional rights, as explained [here](#individuals-uk).

### Facebook Pixel

On our Site, we use Facebook Pixel, which tracks user behavior. This Facebook service enables us to measure Facebook activity on our dedicated Facebook page and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Facebook stores and processes your personal information and activity. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Privacy Policy. For individuals in the EEA, please note that by enabling Facebook Pixel, we are jointly responsible for the processing, as explained [Signaturely as a ‘Joint Controller’ with Facebook](#join-controller).

To adjust how ads are targeted to you based on your activity on or off of Facebook, visit Facebook’s help page available here. Facebook also provides a tool called Off-Facebook-Activity, which can be found in your Facebook settings.

Social Media
------------

Signaturely maintains an online presence on social media platforms (“Social Media Platforms”) such as Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, to provide information about our Services and communicate with users and/or visitors to those pages or accounts. When you interact or post to our account, we process your personal information. In some cases, the Social Media Platforms are service providers or processors. In other cases, such as with Facebook, we are jointly responsible for the processing, as explained in the section titled [Signaturely as a ‘Joint Controller’ with Facebook](#join-controller) .

How We Secure Personal Information
----------------------------------

We use reasonably appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of personal information both online and offline. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. Please note, though, that no website or internet transmission is completely secure, so while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur. You can read more about our security protocols by clicking [here](https://signaturely.com/security).

Do Not Track Signals
--------------------

Certain internet web browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, we do not currently respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.

Your Choices
------------

### Use of Cookies and Automated Technologies on the Site

How you make choices about cookies and other tracking technologies depends on the type of cookie or tracking technology being used. For details on how to manage your preferences for cookies and tracking technologies within your web browser, please see our [Cookie Statement](https://signaturely.com/cookie-statement/).

### Marketing Activities

If you are receiving promotional emails from us, you can choose to stop receiving those by following the unsubscribe/opt-out instructions in those emails. You can also contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://signaturely.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

* Legal Obligation: Signaturely may have legal obligations to retain and/or disclose your personal information, or may cooperate in a legal or governmental investigation.

Information about the personal information that is collected from you by Facebook, as well as how and why it is processed by Facebook, can be found at [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy).

Signaturely and Facebook have entered into entered into an agreement in order to determine the respective responsibilities for compliance with our obligations in connection with the Joint Processing within the meaning of the GDPR.

We process your personal data on our Facebook page in the following ways:

It cannot be excluded that some processing by Facebook Ireland Ltd. will also take place in the United States by Facebook Inc.

### How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?

We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods: the amount, nature and sensitivity of your information, the reasons for which we collect and process your personal information, how long we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Services, and applicable legal requirements. We will retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements), when we are unable to reasonably verify your identity, or as may otherwise be required under GDPR. Additionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (also known as a “litigation hold”). In this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims.

When we have no ongoing business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If you have questions about, or need further information concerning, our data retention periods, please email [\[email protected\]](https://signaturely.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Note that with respect to Services Data, our retention periods may vary as set forth in the [Terms of Use](https://signaturely.com/terms/).

### Staying in Control of Your Information: Your Rights

WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES DATA OR IF YOU ARE A CONTACT, YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS REQUESTS WITH THE CUSTOMER(S) (ACTING AS ‘DATA CONTROLLER’) ON BEHALF OF WHICH SIGNATURELY PROVIDES THE SERVICES AND COLLECTS SERVICES DATA, AS EXPLAINED [HERE](#we-collect). IF WE RECEIVE SUCH REQUESTS, WE WILL SEND THOSE REQUESTS TO THE RELEVANT CUSTOMER, WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESPONDING TO AND ADDRESSING RIGHTS REQUESTS, WITH OUR COOPERATION.

If the GDPR (or its equivalent in the U.K.) applies to you because you are in the EEA or the U.K., you have certain rights in relation to your personal information:

* The right to be informed – our obligation to inform you that we process your personal information (and that is what we are doing in this Privacy Notice)
* The right of access – your right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you (also known as a ‘data subject access request’)
* The right to rectification – your right to request that we correct personal information about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings)
* The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) – under certain circumstances, you may ask us to delete the personal information we have about you (unless there is an overriding legal reason we need to keep it)
* The right to restrict processing – your right, under certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend our processing of your personal information
* The right to data portability – your right to ask us for a copy of your personal information in a common format (for example, a .csv file)
* The right to object – your right to object to us processing your personal information (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing)
* Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling – our obligation to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making.
* The right to withdraw your consent where you had previously given consent. To access our cookie banner, please click here.

These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them. If are located in the EEA and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us (see [How to Contact Us about Privacy](#how-privacy) ).

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request under those circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. **Note that if we are unable to reasonably confirm your identity, we will not be able to honor certain requests.**

We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.

In addition, if you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you. If you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing our Services.

Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please contact us directly first.
