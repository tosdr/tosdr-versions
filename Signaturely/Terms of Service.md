Terms of Service and Subscription Agreement
===========================================

These Terms of Service (this **“Agreement”**) are entered into by and between Signaturely, LLC, a California limited liability company (**“Signaturely”** or **“we”**) and you (**“you”** or **“your”**). You and Signaturely may also be referred to individually as a “Party” and, collectively, as the “Parties.”

**IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS  AS THEY DESCRIBE AND, IN SOME CASES, LIMIT YOUR RIGHTS.**

**YOUR USE OF THIS SITE INDICATES  
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.**

**WHEREAS**, Signaturely has developed, owns and operates the platform known as “**Signaturely.com**” and such other related online websites and applications as Signaturely may create and partner with (collectively, the “**Site**”);

**WHEREAS**, the Site provides users (each, a ”**User**” and, collectively, the “**Users**”) an opportunity to sign and obtain signatures from others digitally (the “**Services**”);

**WHEREAS**, the Services are provided on a subscription basis; and

**WHEREAS**, the Services provided to you shall be included in any reference to your “use” of the Site.

**THEREFORE**, the Parties agree as follows:

### 1\. AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND

You agree to be bound by this Agreement by use of the Site. If you do not agree with or do not wish to be bound by any provision hereof, cease using this Site immediately.

### 2\. DEFINITIONS

In addition to the definitions provided throughout the Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings when used herein:

“**Affiliate**” means any entity that directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under the common ownership or control with a Party, where ownership or control is denoted by having more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power (or equivalent ownership interest) of the applicable entity.

“**Document**” means a single file that can be Posted by a Posting User.  The Document may contain multiple agreements, contracts, certificates, etc., so long as they are uploaded to the Site or made available, communicated or transmitted via an application program interface provided by Signaturely (a “Signaturely API”) as one (1) file.

“**Documentation**” means any manuals, documentation, and other supporting materials related to the Site that Signaturely provides to you or that you can access under this Agreement.  Documentation is considered part of the Site.

“**Post**” means to upload a Document to the Site or to make available, communicate or transmit a Document via a Signaturely API for signature.

“**Posting User**” means a User who Posts a Document.

“**Recipient User**” means such person(s) as the Posting User requests to sign a Document when Posting a Document.

### 3\. THE SERVICES

**3.1 Registration**

Signaturely provides a platform on which a Posting User can Post a Document to make such Document available for review and signature by the Posting User, if desired, as well as by Recipient Users.

Each User who desires to Post and make Documents available for signature shall register with the Site, providing information pertaining to User’s location, age and such other information as Signaturely may deem appropriate.

A User need not be registered to receive, review and sign Documents; but every User, whether or not registered, will be subject to these terms and conditions.

At the time of registration, you may elect a complimentary account which will entitle you to the Services as described on the Site for “Free Accounts” (collectively, the “**Basic Services**”), for which no credit card is required and no charges will be imposed.

Upon successful registration, you shall have an account and access to the Site that will enable you to Post Documents for signature. You may Post as many Documents as provided in the Subscription Plan chosen during the then-current Term. You may upgrade to a different Subscription Plan at any time. You may also downgrade to a Subscription Plan that provides less Services, effective upon the renewal date of your then-current Subscription, but there will be no credits or offsets for the portion of the then-current Subscription Term after you downgrade.

If a Recipient User does not have or create a Registered Account, free or otherwise, he/she will be able to download or print Documents he/she has signed but will not be able to review at a later time Documents signed by him or her.

**3.2 Subscriptions**

Each Subscription shall commence on the day purchased and shall continue, unless terminated, on a monthly or annual basis (the “Subscription Term”). Notwithstanding termination of a Subscription, you shall continue to be bound by this Agreement as to all terms that apply to Users, in general.

You may also elect, either at the time of initial registration or at any later date, to pay for a subscription (each, a “**Paid** **Subscription**”) that will afford you Services in addition to the Basic Services (see “**Subscription Plans**” for more information).  Each purchaser of a Subscription is a “**Paid Subscriber.**”

Registration as a Paid Subscriber shall include providing a valid credit card which we will charge the “**Subscription Fee**” on a recurring basis in accordance with the Subscription Plan chosen by you.

**3.3 Termination**

Upon expiration of your Subscription, the Subscription Term shall automatically renew on the same terms and conditions as contained herein (the initial Subscription Term and all renewal Subscription Terms shall be referred to herein, collectively, as the “**Subscription Term**”) unless you terminate your Subscription by providing written notice of non-renewal to Signaturely prior to expiration of the then-current Subscription Term.  Upon renewal, the method of payment provided by you shall be charged the Subscription Fee for the same Subscription Plan as your expiring Subscription Plan.

Signaturely reserves the right to change its prices by giving you written notice of such change prior to expiration of the then-current Subscription Term and such change shall become effective for the renewal Subscription Term in the absence of cancellation by you.

A Subscription may be terminated by either you or Signaturely at any time, for any or no reason, effective on the next renewal date. However, Signaturely may also terminate your Subscription immediately due to a breach by you of this Agreement.

Upon expiration or the effective date of termination of your Subscription and in the absence of termination of your account by Signaturely,

(a) the Subscription Term shall end;

(b) your account will automatically convert to a free account to which you will have access to the Basic Services and any Documents that were Posted prior to expiration or termination that are awaiting signatures at the time that termination becomes effective, such Documents shall still be processed and available on the Site until all parties to such Document have either signed or affirmatively declined to sign, or the Posting User has removed the Document;

(c) you shall not be billed for any recurring Subscription Fees;

(d) you shall continue to have access to all reports, histories and data of your account; and

(e) in the case of a termination by you for any reason or a termination by Signaturely for any reason other than a breach of this Agreement by you, termination shall be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription Term and there shall be no refunds or discounts of the Subscription Fee paid.

In the case of a termination of your account (not only your Subscription) by Signaturely due to a breach by you of this Agreement, the effective date of such termination may, in the sole discretion of Signaturely, be at any time between the date of notice of termination and the end of the then-current Subscription Term, there shall be no refunds or discounts of the Subscription Fee paid, Signaturely reserves the right to claim additional damages as Signaturely determines to be appropriate and warranted and Signaturely reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any Documents in process at the time of termination.

**3.4 License to Branding Elements**

Customer hereby grants Signaturely a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, and worldwide license to use Customer’s trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, brand names, logos, corporate names, domain names, and other branding elements on or in connection with Signaturely’s promotional, advertising, and marketing materials in all formats and media, including, without limitation, on lists of Signaturely’s current or former customers and on advertisements for Signaturely and/or the Product, Subscription Services, and/or the Website.

Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party’s Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as such Party uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in all events at least a reasonable degree of care.

The restrictions set forth in this Section shall remain in effect during the Subscription Term, and for five (5) years thereafter. The restrictions set forth in this Section will not apply with respect to any Confidential Information that: (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving Party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving Party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing Party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing Party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing Party; or (iv) the receiving Party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party’s Confidential Information.
