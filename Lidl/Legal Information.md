This is based on the business interest of improving the Lidl website experience, customer offerings and online services. These surveys provide anonymous results and therefore do not store any information that identifies individual survey participants. Only the date and time of your participation will be saved. The data processed would include your age range, gender, location and opinions or additional information provided freely by yourself in any free text fields.

If there are any free-text fields in a survey, we ask that you do not provide any personal data relating to yourself or another individual.

Additionally, whenever you contact customer care, you are given the opportunity to participate in a satisfaction survey. If you wish to take part by phone, you can do so by giving your consent at the end of the call. If you prefer to take part by e-mail, we will send a questionnaire to the e-mail address you provide to us.

The results of our customer surveys are used for internal evaluations only.

Any information you do choose to provide also will be considered given voluntarily.

  

The purpose of collecting data is for internal evaluation to improve the customer experience both in store and when contacting the Customer Care department. On Occasion our Customer Care team may contact you to discus your NPS response in more detail.

  

Should you not wish to be contacted please email customer.care@lidl.co.uk with the subject line ‘NPS Feedback’ and our Customer Care team will ensure you are not contacted regarding your NPS survey response.

Purposes of data processing/legal basis

  

You can sign up for our marketing communications on our website, in our mobile applications, the websites or mobile applications of partner companies and via embedded content on our social media presences. If you have expressly consented to receiving our Lidl marketing communications (email, SMS, WhatsApp, push notifications), we will use your email address or mobile phone number and, if applicable, your name to send you information (see Section "Advertising content"), taking into account your user profile (see Section "Personalised user profile").

  

In order to ensure that no errors have been made when entering the email address, we use the double opt-in procedure. After you have entered your email address in the registration field, we will send you a confirmation link. Only when you click on this confirmation link will your email address be added to our mailing list. We will do the same with your mobile phone number if you have provided it to us as part of the Lidl Plus registration process.

  

You can withdraw your consent to receiving marketing communications, including the creation of personalised user profiles, at any time with effect for the future, e.g. at the end of each newsletter, in your Lidl Plus account or via our customer care department at customer.care@lidl.co.uk. When you unsubscribe, we consider your consent to the creation of this personalised user profile and the receipt of newsletters based on it to be withdrawn.

  

The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR or, if consent has been given, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The processing of existing customer data for our own advertising purposes or for the advertising purposes of third parties is a legitimate interest within the meaning of the first-mentioned provision.

  

Recipients/categories of recipients

  

The recipients include the operators of social networks, advertising partners and specialised service providers who process personal data on our behalf in accordance with our instructions.

  

If external data processors are used to carry out marketing communications, they are contractually obliged in accordance with Article 28 GDPR.

  

Storage period/criteria for determining the storage period

  

If you withdraw your consent to individual advertising measures or object to certain advertising measures, your data will be deleted from the corresponding (email) distribution lists within 48 hours.

  

If you file an objection, your contact address will be blocked for further advertising data processing. We would like to point out that in exceptional cases, advertising material may still be sent or advertising campaigns displayed temporarily even after we have received your objection. This is technically due to the necessary lead time for adverts and does not mean that we will not implement your objection.

  

Your registration data will then be stored for ten years as proof that we have complied with legal requirements. When registering for the newsletter on a social media site, the data protection information of the respective operator of the social media site also applies.

  

Further data processing for advertising purposes

  

Furthermore, we process data concerning you for advertising purposes using cookies and similar technologies as described in Section 8 in more detail.

  

13.1 Personalised user profile

  

With your consent, we and the following operators of Lidl websites and Lidl apps, as well as the senders of Lidl newsletters, record your user behaviour:

The evaluation of user behaviour includes the following information in particular:

 Used areas of the respective website, the mobile apps or the newsletter,

 Activated links,

 Time of opening,

 Products selected or added to the shopping basket,

 Time, duration and frequency of use,

 Participation in surveys,

 Redeemed vouchers,

 Purchase data,

 Frequency and timeliness/timing? of your store purchases when using Lidl Plus.

We use this data to create personalised user profiles by assigning your person and/or email address or mobile phone number in order to be able to better tailor advertising to your personal interests by means of newsletters, SMS, WhatsApp/push notifications, on-site advertising and print advertising, and to improve our offers and digital presence.

We can also enrich this user profile with information about your age and gender if you have given us your consent to do so.

If you have filled in the "About me" section in Lidl Plus, this data will also be used to customise our Services to your interests. The legal basis for this is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (contract between Lidl Stiftung and you).

13.2 Advertising content

  

The content of our marketing communications includes information about promotions, products and services (e.g. offers, discount promotions, competitions, Lidl Plus programme benefits, streaming offers, services, surveys, product reviews) from our website, the Lidl app, store operations and from the operators of the Lidl websites and Lidl apps. These are currently in particular:

13.3 Push notifications

  

Purposes of data processing/legal basis

  

To receive regular information on news, offers, promotions and reminders about unfinished orders, you can register to receive push notifications.

  

To do this, you must confirm the request from end device to receive push notifications. The login time and a push token or your device ID are then saved. This data is used to send push notifications and as proof of registration.

  

The Lidl app only uses push notifications if you activate push notifications when installing the app or at a later time in the settings of your device. You can deactivate the receipt of push notifications at any time in the Lidl app.

  

We analyse push messages statistically in order to determine whether and when push messages were displayed and clicked on. This enables us to determine the presumed interests of the recipients and thus optimise the push messages.

  

The legal basis for processing your data to send push notifications is your consent in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.

  

Recipients/categories of recipients

  

If external data processors are used to send push notifications, they are contractually obliged to do so in accordance with Article 28 GDPR.

  

Storage period/criteria for determining the storage period

  

Your data will be stored as long as you have activated push notifications.

  

14\. Use of cookies and similar technologies to process usage data

**14\. Use of cookies and similar technologies to process usage data**

  

The use of cookies and similar technologies for processing usage data (in particular local storage) means that when you visit our website (www.lidl.co.uk) and some of the web pages embedded there (in particular account.lidl.com) and the Lidl app, files are stored locally on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar). Sometimes a so-called tag is used to display personalised advertising, which is integrated into these services (hereinafter referred to as “similar technologies for processing usage data”). This is a code that collects usage data.

  

14.1 Responsibility

  

Lidl Great Britain and Lidl Stiftung are joint controllers for most data processing in connection with the use of cookies and other similar technologies (uniformly referred to as "cookies") to process usage data on these Services.

Beyond this, the responsibility relationships are as follows:

  

14.2 Responsibility for cookies for self-promotion purposes

  

For some of the data processing associated with the marketing cookies for self-promotion (see cookies under the category "Self-promotion" in our cookie notices), in addition to us, the following are also involved: Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (Facebook), RTB House GmbH, Kurfürstendamm 226, 10719 Berlin, Germany (RTB House), TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited, Kaleidoscope, 4 Lindsey Street, London, EC1A 9HP, United Kingdom (TikTok). They are joint controllers pursuant to Article 26 GDPR.

  

We use cookies and carry out associated data processing for the purposes of self-promotion. We can combine these with your age, your gender and your usage behaviour on the website or in the Lidl app to create a profile.

  

In addition, in this context, data in the Lidl app about you is also partially processed by the advertising partner The UK Trade Desk Ltd., c / o The Trade Desk, Inc., 42 N. Chestnut Street, Ventura, CA 93001, USA (“TTD”) as a separately responsible person for displaying personalised advertising and for measuring success. In order to be able to link your usage behavior with you, the identifiers (MAID, hashed e-mail address and / or hashed telephone number) are forwarded to TTD on the basis of your consent. You will find further information on data processing as well as how you can assert your rights as a data subject in TTD's data protection information.

We also use the Microsoft Advertising and Microsoft Clarity Services of the provider Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, D18 P521, Ireland (Microsoft) and the Google Advertising Service of the provider Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (Google) for self-promotion in our Services. Microsoft and Google also process your data as part of the Microsoft and Google Advertising Services under their own responsibility.

  

We use the "Facebook Custom Audience" Service of Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Meta", "Facebook") in the Lidl app. In this respect, we are joint controllers with Meta pursuant to Article 26 GDPR.

  

  

14.3 Purposes/data processing

  

14.3.1 General presentation

  

We place cookies on your end device, by means of which the data specified below is collected and then processed for the purposes stated below.

  

* Technically necessary: These are cookies and similar technologies without which you cannot use our Services (for example, to display our Services correctly, including font and colour, to provide the functions you have requested and to take your settings into account, to save your registration in the login area, etc.).
* Convenience: These technologies allow us to take into account your preferences to offer you the best user experience on our website and the Lidl app. For example, we can use your settings to display our Services in a language that suits you. In this way, we also avoid showing you products that may not be available in your region.
* Statistics: These technologies enable us to compile pseudonymised/anonymised? statistics on the use of our Services. This allows us to determine, for example, how we can customise our website or the Lidl app even better to users’ habits. We use your IP address as well as online identifiers, log files and your location (based on network) to prevent misuse and to prevent and identify any security breaches and other prohibited or illegal activities. For example, if you log in from a new/unknown device, we can inform you of such a login attempt.
* Marketing - Self-promotion: This enables us and other data controllers (see above) to display suitable advertising content based on the analysis of user behaviour and information from your customer account (age, gender, store purchase data from the Lidl Plus Service, if applicable). Your usage behaviour can also be tracked via various websites, apps, browsers and end devices using a user ID (unique identifier).

  

Further details on the processing purposes can be found in the preferences manager.

  

14.3.2 Selected Services

  

Google Ads Customer Match:

  

We use the "Google Ads Customer Match" Service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"). Lists of user data are sent to Google servers with the help of the tracking technologies we use. Google then compares whether the transmitted user data matches data from Google customers and then creates target groups that can be used to target adverts. The adverts can be displayed within the Google network (YouTube, Gmail or within the search engine) as well as across devices (known as remarketing or retargeting).

  

We have concluded an order processing contract with Google for the use of Google Ads Customer Matching in accordance with Article 28(3) GDPR. Through this contract, Google guarantees that it will process the personal data in accordance with the/our instructions and guarantee the protection of data subject rights.

  

Information on how Google uses personal data transmitted to Google by integrating Services and on your setting options for personalised advertising and data collection can be found at here and here. General information on data processing by Google can be found in the Google Privacy Policy.

  

Meta/Facebook:

  

Facebook Custom Audience enables us to create target groups and to design and display personalised advertisements on Facebook in line with requirements.

This involves uploading lists of user data to Facebook. Facebook then compares whether the transmitted user data matches data from Facebook users and then creates target groups that can be used to target adverts on Facebook. With Custom Audience, we ensure that only people who have previously visited our app or are interested in our products are shown adverts on Facebook. Facebook also uses the data for its own advertising purposes and for the advertising purposes of third parties.

  

Further selected data processing in connection with self-promotion:

  

With your consent, we use special technologies from partners so that we can record your surfing/browsing behaviour and display advertising tailored to you on our website, the Lidl app or our partners' platform (Facebook, , TDD, RTB House and TikTok). Our partners can also compare the data collected on these Services with their own databases.

  

Microsoft Advertising and Google Advertising can be used to display targeted advertisements via the Microsoft and Google networks (e.g. in search engines and email programs), optimise them and track the activities of users on our website if they have reached our website via advertisements. Microsoft Clarity can be used to track and visualise user interactions with our services.

  

We also use Microsoft and Google Advertising Services to collect information that allows us to track target groups using remarketing lists. Microsoft Advertising and Google Advertising can recognise that these Services have been visited and an advertisement can be displayed when Microsoft or Google networks are subsequently used. The information is also used to create conversion statistics, i.e. to record how many users have accessed these Services after clicking on an advert. This tells us the total number of users who clicked on our advert and were redirected to these Services. However, we do not receive any information with which users can be personally identified.

  

14.4 Data categories

  

When cookies and similar technologies are used to process usage data, the following types of personal data in particular are processed, depending on the purpose:

  

Technically necessary:

* Authentication data to identify a user after login in order to gain access to authorised content on subsequent visits (e.g. access to the Lidl Plus customer account);
* Security-related events (e.g. detection of frequently failed login attempts);
* Data required to playback multimedia content (e.g. playback of (product) videos selected by the user);
* Information to display our website correctly, including font and colour, to provide the functions you have requested and to take your settings into account, such as the choices you have made regarding cookies and similar technologies, to save your registration in the login area, etc.

* User interface customisation settings that are not linked to a permanent identifier (e.g. language selection or the specific display of search queries or maps in the store finder).

  

Statistics:

  

* Browser type/version,
* Operating system used,
* Previously visited page (referrer URL),
* Host name of the accessing computer (IP address; this is regularly anonymised so that it cannot be traced back to you),
* Time of the server request,
* Individual user ID and events triggered on the website (surfing/browsing behaviour). We only merge the user ID with other data from you (e.g. name, email address, etc.) with your express consent (see e.g. Section 8 of this Data Protection Notice). The user ID itself does not allow us to draw any conclusions about your person.

  

Marketing - Self-promotion:

  

* Information about the use of our website, in particular:

o IP address (this is regularly anonymised so that it cannot be used to identify you personally),

o Individual user ID (including cookie identifier) or other identifiers (email address, telephone number, address); we only merge the user ID with other data from you (e.g. name, email address, age, gender, etc.) with your express consent. The user ID alone does not allow us to draw any conclusions about your person. We may share the user ID and the associated user profiles with third parties via the providers of advertising networks.

o Potential product interests,

o Access information,

o Device identifiers,

o Information about device and browser settings,

o Mouse/scroll movements,

o Triggered events on the website (surfing behaviour).

* We use the following advertising identifiers for in-app analysis and the display of personalised advertising: (i) the IDFA (Identifier for Advertising) for iOS devices or (ii) the Android advertising ID or (iii) the Huawei ID, the IP/MAC address, the HTTP header as well as the email address, telephone number, address and a fingerprint of your end device (additionally: time of access, country, language, local settings, operating system and version as well as the app version). We also include user device and web activity information as well as app and event tokens in this analysis. This data is processed exclusively on a pseudonymised/anonymised basis. You can reset or deactivate the IDFA or Google GAID, the Android advertising ID and the Huawei ID at any time via your operating system. In the event that the IDFA is not available, we use the SkAdNetwork (Apple’s attribution API) to assign the installations of our app to an advertising campaign.
* Store purchasing data from the Lidl Plus loyalty program

  

Specific to the Lidl app:

  

In order to display interest-based information to you, we must be able to assign the above-mentioned information to you as a person. For this purpose, we establish a connection to your customer number from the time you complete your Lidl Plus registration. Your consent to the provision of personalised information also covers this processing step.

The use of map services is based on our contractual relationship with you, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, as well as on our legitimate interest in presenting our offers in an attractive manner and making it easy to find the locations specified by us in the app. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6. If you use the map services in the Lidl app or have agreed to geolocalisation in the settings of your mobile device via the "Give permissions" dialogue, we use this function to be able to offer you individual services based on your current location. In particular, we process your GPS and network-based location for the "store search", "e-charging station search" and "partner benefits search" functions in order to show you the stores closest to you. We do not store geolocalisation data permanently.

Controller

  

Lidl Great Britain is responsible for the data processing for Google reCAPTCHA.

  

Purposes of data processing/legal basis

  

We use Google reCAPTCHA to protect your data and the transmission of forms, in particular in the context of participating in competitions and registering for newsletters on the website, from attacks or misuse by automated programmes (known as bots). Bots are used, for example, to obtain passwords for customer accounts or to restrict the functionality of the website through mass data transfers.

  

Google reCAPTCHA determines whether the interaction with the website is by a human user or a bot. For this purpose, usage behaviour (time spent on the page or mouse movements made) is analysed and the IP address is read by Google and checked to see whether it could be assigned to a bot in the past. If the IP address has already been assigned to a bot, Google transmits this information to us. We then store these IP addresses for defence against future attacks. This analysis starts automatically as soon as you open the registration page.

  

The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the above-mentioned purposes of processing.

  

Recipients/categories of recipients

  

When using Google reCAPTCHA, the above-mentioned data is also processed by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA to provide the Service. We have no influence over the processing and use of data by Google. Further information on data processing by Google can be found here: https://policies.google.com/privacy.

The links may also contain special tracking techniques that enable the operators of the websites/applications mentioned to understand and measure where the user has learnt about them. We have no influence over data processing by these websites/apps. We recommend that you check the relevant privacy policy of each website/app you are redirected to in order to understand what information about you is processed by the operator.

  

If we redirect you to one of these websites/apps, we process your personal data in order to fulfil your (technical) request to visit the respective application or website (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR) and on the basis of the operator’s legitimate interest in carrying out advertising (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).

23\. Stores

If you pay by card, we as a retailer collect your personal data via the payment terminal and transmit the data to the network operator. The network operator and the respective payment service providers for the authorisation and settlement of the payment transactions (e.g. acquirer) process the data further. The purposes are processing of payment, prevention of card misuse, limiting the risk of payment defaults and legally required purposes, such as combating money laundering and criminal prosecution. For these purposes your data will also be shared with other responsible parties, such as your card-issuing bank. Personal Data is at no time shared with the network operator

  

  

  

We as a retailer and the acquirer are each responsible for processing the data as follows:

  

We are responsible for operating the payment terminal at the check-out and for our internal network to securely transmit data via Internet or telephone line to the network operator, whilst the acquirer is responsible for the processing and settlement of payment transactions.

  

  

  

We process your card data (card number, expiry date, issue number and cvv) and other payment data (purchase amount, date, time, terminal identification, location, company and store where you pay, as well as your signature). The purpose is the processing of the payment and carrying out the payment process with the payment service provider and, if necessary, to process a cash withdrawal and to check creditworthiness.

  

  

  

The legitimate interest consists in the processing of the cash withdrawal or the payment process. The card data is processed only in hashed form and deleted as soon as it is no longer required for processing the payment and there are no legal retention periods which require to keep the data.

  

  

  

**If you pay with debit/credit card, we forward in an encrypted format the following payment information to the network operator** Ingenico Retail Enterprise (UK) Limited, registered office is Ingenico House, Rudheath Way, Gadbrook Park, Northwich, Cheshire, CW9 7LT: **card number, expiry date, issue number, cvv, date, time, purchase amount, terminal identification, city, company and store**. **For more information please refer to their data protection regulations** https://www.ingenico.com/legal/ifs/data-processing

24\. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) In Our Car Parks

Some of our stores have ANPR cameras to prevent overstaying which ensures our customers can always park when shopping with us. For stores where Lidl directly manages its own carparks, these are operated by ParkingEye.

Some of our stores are located within retail parks where ANPR is in operation so these schemes maybe operated by other carpark management companies. Please check the signs when parking in all of our stores as this will confirm if ANPR is in operation and who the carpark management company that managed the scheme.
