If there are any free-text fields in a survey, we ask that you do not provide any personal data relating to yourself or another individual.

Additionally, whenever you contact customer care, you are given the opportunity to participate in a satisfaction survey. If you wish to take part by phone, you can do so by giving your consent at the end of the call. If you prefer to take part by e-mail, we will send a questionnaire to the e-mail address you provide to us.

14\. Social Media Plug Ins

**The Lidl website and other online/mobile sites may use Social Media plug-ins for the social networks:**

  

  

• Facebook (Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA)

  

• Twitter (Twitter, Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA)

  

• YouTube (YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, USA, a subsidiary of Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA)

  

• Instagram (Instagram Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA, a subsidiary of Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA)

  

• LinkedIn (LinkedIn Ireland, 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland)

  

• Pinterest, 505 Brannan Street San Francisco, CA 94107 United States

  

• TikTok Culver City, 10100 Venice Blvd #401, CA, United States

  

  

  

Social Media plug-ins are social network programs that are embedded on other companies’ websites. Embedding a Social Media plug-in allows personal data to be transmitted to the provider of the social media plug-in. If you are also logged on to a social network, an activated social media plug-in enables your activities to be assigned to your profile.

  

  

For data protection reasons, we have decided to initially block the social media plug-ins that are embedded on our website.

  

  

We do, however, offer you the possibility of using social media plug-ins if you so desire.

  

  

The plug-in is only activated by you clicking on the desired plug-in symbol for example, clicking on the Facebook logo, which we have pre-connected.

  

  

Please note that, when the plug-in you have selected is activated, this results in personal data being transmitted to the respective provider of the social media service.

  

  

The plug-in you have activated immediately sets up via your browser a connection to the server of the social media provider you have selected.

  

  

We would expressly point out that we have no influence on the scope, type and purpose of the processing of your personal data by the provider of the social media service and can inform you only according to our level of knowledge at this point.

  

  

**The personal data collected and processed by the social media providers includes:**

  

  

• Your IP address

  

• The address of the website on which the activated social plug-in is located,

  

• Information about the browser used and the operating system you use,

  

  

The date and time our website was accessed or the social media plug-in was activated, respectively

  

  

The above-mentioned data is transmitted and stored when the plug-in is activated irrespective of whether you are a Member of the corresponding social media provider.

  

  

In addition we would refer you at this point explicitly to the social media provider’s privacy policy.

  

View Facebook's policy here.

  

View Twitter's policy here.

  

View YouTube's policy here.

  

View Instagram's policy here.

  

View Linkedin’s policy here.

  

  

  

If at the time of the interaction you are also logged on to a social media provider, such as Facebook, it is capable of learning your user name or, if stored, your real name, and assigning the interaction to your profile.

  

  

The above-mentioned data also makes it possible for the providers of the social media services to create pseudonymised (de-personalised), and potentially also individualised, usage profiles for their own purposes.

  

  

Where there is interaction with the activated plug-in (e.g. Facebook “likes”), the social media provider may store a cookie on your device, which also makes it possible to identify your profile.

  

  

If the plug-in is activated, your IP address is stored and a cookie saved irrespective of whether you are member of the social media providers.

  

  

We would expressly point out that the duration of storage of such cookies is not known to us and we have no influence over it. In the case of non-members, a usage profile might subsequently be created by any stored cookie, when you log on to a social media provider in the future.

  

  

Please note that when a social media plug-in is activated, your personal data can also be stored, processed and used in countries outside the European Union and in countries that do not have an adequate and appropriate level of data protection to that of the European Union.

  

  

You can prevent/delete cookies for our website to prevent the above activities from happening, though it may affect your user experience.

15\. Social Listening

**Why do we use personal data?**

  

In addition to the information we have directly shared with you through social networks, we also use the option of “social listening” to get an idea and perception of our products and services and to identify any potential for improvement. Contributions made public by you on online platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) are reviewed and evaluated. Only contributions that have been made publicly available will be processed.

  

The personal data processed is determined by the type of content posted e.g. posting in text form or an uploaded image file will be processed. In individual cases, your username or ID used may be relevant if you ask for help from Lidl. We also receive information from the respective platform operators on the scope of the respective contributions.

  

  

  

The legal basis for the processing of personal data is our legitimate interest in being able to identify in publicly made comments or deficiencies in our products and services and to react to them in an appropriate manner.

  

  

  

**Who can assess your personal data?**

  

In the process of social listening personal data is also processed on our behalf by Processors in the Marketing Sector. These are carefully selected, audited by us and are contractually obliged in accordance with GDPR.

  

  

  

**How long do we store your personal data?**

  

All the companies listed as providers in our cookie notice are acting for us as processors, unless they are named as a (joint) controller at the beginning of this paragraph.

  

As part of our cooperation with Google LLC and Facebook Ireland Limited, the above-mentioned personal data is usually also processed on servers in the USA for statistical and marketing purposes.

  

To the extent covered by your respective consent, your data will also be collected as described above by Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG as separate or joint controller.

  

  

  

**Recipients outside of the EU or the UK**

  

If we transmit data to recipients in a third country (based outside the European Economic Area or the UK), you can find more information on the recipients / categories of recipients in the description of the respective data processing activity. The European Commission certifies that some third countries have a data protection standard that is comparable to the level in the European Economic Area. These are called adequacy decisions. A list of these countries can be found here.

  

  

  

If the data protection standard in a country should not be adequate, we ensure that data protection is guaranteed by other measures, for example binding company regulations, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data, certificates, or recognised codes of conduct. Please contact our Data Protection Officer (Section 19) if you would like to find out more information on this.

  

  

  

  

**Storage duration / criteria for determining the storage duration:**

  

The relevant personal data is not permanently stored by Lidl, but only viewed and analysed to understand where we can potentially take action and do better.

17\. Stores

If you pay by card, we as a retailer collect your personal data via the payment terminal and transmit the data to the network operator. The network operator and the respective payment service providers for the authorisation and settlement of the payment transactions (e.g. acquirer) process the data further. The purposes are processing of payment, prevention of card misuse, limiting the risk of payment defaults and legally required purposes, such as combating money laundering and criminal prosecution. For these purposes your data will also be shared with other responsible parties, such as your card-issuing bank. Personal Data is at no time shared with the network operator

  

  

  

We as a retailer and the acquirer are each responsible for processing the data as follows:

  

We are responsible for operating the payment terminal at the check-out and for our internal network to securely transmit data via Internet or telephone line to the network operator, whilst the acquirer is responsible for the processing and settlement of payment transactions.

  

  

  

We process your card data (card number, expiry date, issue number and cvv) and other payment data (purchase amount, date, time, terminal identification, location, company and store where you pay, as well as your signature). The purpose is the processing of the payment and carrying out the payment process with the payment service provider and, if necessary, to process a cash withdrawal and to check creditworthiness.

  

  

  

The legitimate interest consists in the processing of the cash withdrawal or the payment process. The card data is processed only in hashed form and deleted as soon as it is no longer required for processing the payment and there are no legal retention periods which require to keep the data.

  

  

  

**If you pay with debit/credit card, we forward in an encrypted format the following payment information to the network operator** Ingenico Retail Enterprise (UK) Limited, registered office is Ingenico House, Rudheath Way, Gadbrook Park, Northwich, Cheshire, CW9 7LT: **card number, expiry date, issue number, cvv, date, time, purchase amount, terminal identification, city, company and store**. **For more information please refer to their data protection regulations** https://www.ingenico.com/legal/ifs/data-processing

  

**If you pay with an American Express card, we will forward your payment information to American Express** Services Europe Limited, Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, United Kingdom **For more information about the processing of your data by the card provider, please refer to their data protection regulations** https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/legal/european-implementing-principles.html

  

**In line with repairing card terminals, the used service provider** Ingenico Retail Enterprise (UK) Limited, registered office is Ingenico House, Rudheath Way, Gadbrook Park, Northwich, Cheshire, CW9 7LT, **may gain access to the payment data stored on the payment terminals.**

  

**If required by law, your data will be transmitted to law enforcement agencies and money laundering reporting offices.**

  

**You are neither legally nor contractually obliged to provide us with your data. However, a card payment is not possible without the data. Alternatively, you can pay with cash at any time.**

  

  

  

**Age verification checks**

  

When selling products with age restrictions, such as alcohol (18 years) / the sale of computer games, DVDs, videos cassettes with age restrictions , our cashier staff will carry out a visual inspection of your ID card for the purpose of age verification in line with our Think25 policy as advertised in our stores. The legal basis is compliance with our legal obligation to not sell age-restricted products to persons under-age and legitimate interest in carrying out due diligence checks.

18\. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) In Our Car Parks

Some of our stores have ANPR cameras to prevent overstaying which ensures our customers can always park when shopping with us. For stores where Lidl directly manages its own carparks, these are operated by ParkingEye. You can find out more about how they process your personal data by visiting their privacy policy.

  

  

  

Some of our stores are located within retail parks where ANPR is in operation so these schemes maybe operated by other carpark management companies. Please check the signs when parking in all of our stores as this will confirm if ANPR is in operation and who the carpark management company that managed the scheme.
