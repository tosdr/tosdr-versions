Terms of Service
----------------

**Effective Date: December 4th, 2017**

Please read these Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) carefully before using the https://www.drift.com website and the Drift mobile application (together, or individually, the “Services”) operated by Drift.com, Inc. (“Drift”, “us”, “we”, or “our”). Your (“Customer,” “you”, or “your”) access to and use of the Services is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Services. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you disagree with any part of this Agreement then you do not have permission to access the Services.

1. **Definitions**
    1. “Activation Link” means the link through which Customer may sign up and make payment in order to receive Services.

    3. “Documentation” means Drift’s then-current generally available documentation, specifications, user manuals, etc. for the Services, which can be located at www.drift.com or such other URL as Drift may provide from time to time, as well as any documentation included in or attached to any Order Form or such other Services-related documents provided to Customer.
    4. “Order Form” the document describing the Services and pricing purchased by Customer and which incorporates these Terms of Service.
    5. “Platform” means Drift’s proprietary, enterprise-level messaging platform.
    6. “Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.

We will provide you with notice of non-payment of any undisputed amount due. Unless the full amount not in dispute has been paid, we may suspend your access to the Services thirty (30) days after such notice. We will not suspend the access to the Services while you are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If your Services are suspended for non-payment, we may charge a re-activation fee to reinstate your access to the Services.

The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information will remain solely the Disclosing Party’s property and proprietary information of the Disclosing Party and that the Receiving Party’s knowledge of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information may enable the Receiving Party to cause the Disclosing Party’s irreparable harm upon the unauthorized disclosure of such matters. The Receiving Party covenants and agrees that it will not use or appropriate for its own behalf, or disclose or communicate, directly or indirectly, any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any external third-party individual, firm, company or other entity or person without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, except to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under the Agreement.  
            The Receiving Party shall take all commercially reasonable steps required to protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure to any third party and shall keep the Confidential Information protected while stored with industry standard and commercially reasonable measures typically used in similar commercial sectors.

            The Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party’s option, return or destroy all Confidential Information in Receiving Party’s possession, and all copies thereof, at any time upon the Disclosing Party’s request.

    4. No Waiver. No delay in exercising any right or remedy or failure to object will be considered a waiver of such right or remedy, or of any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion shall not be a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.
    5. Severability. If any part of these Terms of Service or of an Order Form is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Service will continue in effect.

    13. Changes. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms of Service at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
