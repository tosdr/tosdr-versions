Drift Terms of Service
======================

**Effective Date: December 4th, 2017**

Please read these Terms of Service (the "Agreement") carefully before using the https://www.drift.com website and the Drift mobile application (together, or individually, the "Services") operated by Drift.com, Inc. ("Drift", "us", "we", or "our"). Your ("Customer," "you", or "your") access to and use of the Services is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Services. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you disagree with any part of this Agreement then you do not have permission to access the Services.

1. **Definitions**
    1. "Activation Link" means the link through which Customer may sign up and make payment in order to receive Services.

    3. "Documentation" means Drift’s then-current generally available documentation, specifications, user manuals, etc. for the Services, which can be located at www.drift.com or such other URL as Drift may provide from time to time, as well as any documentation included in or attached to any Order Form or such other Services-related documents provided to Customer.
    4. "Order Form" the document describing the Services and pricing purchased by Customer and which incorporates these Terms of Service.
    5. "Platform" means Drift’s proprietary, enterprise-level messaging platform.
    6. "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual.
    7. "Sensitive Personal Information" means Personal Data subject to specialized security regimes, including without limitation the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), and the standards promulgated by the PCI Security Standards Council ("PCI").
    8. "Services" means Drift’s products and/or services provided to Customer.
    9. "Subscription Term" means the term for the Services set forth in the applicable Order Form or Activation Link.
    10. "User" means an individual employee, consultant, contractor, or agent of Customer who has been authorized by Customer to use the Platform on behalf of Customer and its Affiliates.

    1. Access. During the term of your Order Form, we will provide you with access to the Services.
    2. Fees and Payment. You agree to pay all applicable fees for the Services as set forth on the invoice unless you provide written notice of a dispute regarding such fees no later than 30 days after the invoice date. Any and all payments you make to us for the Services are final and non-refundable. If we agree to accept your payment via invoice rather than by credit card, full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. We will provide you with notice of non-payment of any undisputed amount due. Unless the full amount not in dispute has been paid, we may suspend your access to the Services thirty (30) days after such notice. We will not suspend the access to the Services while you are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If your Services are suspended for non-payment, we may charge a re-activation fee to reinstate your access to the Services.
    3. Subscription Fees and Payment. If you are paying via a credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account for all fees payable during the Subscription Term. You further authorize us to use a PCI-compliant third party to process payments, and consent to the disclosure of your payment information to such third party. If you are paying by invoice, we will invoice you no later than thirty (30) days before the beginning of the Subscription Term and all other times during the Subscription Term when fees are payable.
    4. Availability. Drift will make commercially reasonable efforts to make the Platform available within the defined uptime percentage of at least 99.5% during the monthly billing period.
    5. Warranties. Drift represents and warrants that the Services will be provided in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards.

    4. Subscription Term and Termination.
        1. Term and Renewal. Your initial Subscription Term will be set forth in the Order Form or Activation Link.

        2. Termination. If either party materially breaches any of its duties or obligations under these Terms of Service or an Order Form, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) calendar days of the non-breaching party providing the breaching party of written notice of the breach, the non-breaching party may terminate these Terms of Service or the applicable Order Form, as applicable.
        3. Effect of Termination or Expiration. All provisions of these Terms of Service, which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

The indemnified party will promptly: notify the indemnifying party in writing of any such Claim; give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of such a Claim; and provide the indemnifying party with any and all information and assistance reasonably requested by it in connection with the defense or settlement of the Claim. The indemnifying party shall not accept any settlement that (i) requires the indemnified party to make an admission of fault or wrongdoing; or (ii) imposes liability not covered by these indemnification provisions without the indemnified party’s consent.
    5. Confidentiality. Each party acknowledges that as a result of the Services provided, such party (the "Receiving Party") may receive information from the other party (the "Disclosing Party") that is designated as Confidential Information communicated orally will be considered Confidential Information if the information is confirmed in writing as being Confidential Information within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure.

    4. No Waiver. No delay in exercising any right or remedy or failure to object will be considered a waiver of such right or remedy, or of any other right or remedy. A waiver on one occasion shall not be a waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.
    5. Severability. If any part of these Terms of Service or of an Order Form is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Service will continue in effect.

    9. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. No person or entity not a party to the Agreement will be a third-party beneficiary.

Each party represents and warrants that (a) it has full corporate power and authority, and has obtained all corporate approvals, permissions and consents necessary, to enter into these Terms of Service and to perform its obligations hereunder; (b) these Terms of Service are legally binding upon it and enforceable in accordance with its terms; and (c) the execution, delivery and performance of these Terms of Service do not and will not conflict with any agreement, instrument, judgment or understanding, oral or written, to which it is a party or by which it may be bound.
    11. Precedence. In the event of a conflict of terms between these Terms of Service and any Order Form, the Order Form will control.
    12. Governing law. These Terms of Service shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    13. Changes. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms of Service at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Services after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms of Service. If you do not agree to the new Terms of Service, you are no longer authorized to use the Services.
