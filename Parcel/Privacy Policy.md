Privacy Policy

**Personal Information**  
Parcel does not require its customers to provide any personal information. The only exception is your email address which is required only if you decide to create a Parcel account with an email and password.  
  
You can always create an account with "Sign in with Apple" and your email will not be provided to us.

**Your Deliveries**  
Any information that is related to your deliveries (e.g. tracking numbers, postcodes, tracking history) is not shared with any 3rd parties.

**Anonymous Information**  
Parcel collects anonymous data about your device that does not directly identify you, such as: version of the app, version of the operating system you are running, system language, device model, timezone, country code. This information is used solely for the purpose of improving our services and is not shared with any 3rd parties.

**Account Deletion**  
You can delete your Parcel account in the app settings.

**Advertisements**  
If you are not a subscriber, you will see advertisements in the iOS version of the app. Those ads are managed by Google’s AdMob system. This system was configured not to show personalized ads in Parcel. Tracking and analytic capabilities were also disabled. You can read more about Google’s Privacy policies [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US).
