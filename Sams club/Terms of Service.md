Clubs, Site and Membership Terms of Use
---------------------------------------

### I. Introduction

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the SamsClub.com site and Sam's Club Mobile Application (collectively, "Site") and Sam's Club Stores ("Clubs"). These Terms apply to both Sam's Club Members and non-Members. Your use of the Site constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by these Terms. By using the Site, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms, or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into these Terms. If you violate or do not agree to these Terms, then your access to and use of the Site is unauthorized.

For Sam's Club Members, these Terms also govern your Membership with Sam's Club as further set forth in the Membership section below ("Membership Terms"). By entering and maintaining your Sam's Club Membership, you agree to be bound by these Terms, including the Membership Terms and the terms and conditions related to related Sam's Club policies and programs cross-referenced in the [Additional Terms](#additional-terms) section below.

IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION X BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND SAM’S CLUB ARE EACH GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE EACH OTHER IN COURT OR IN CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.

We may update these Terms from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting revised Terms through the Site. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms incorporating such changes or otherwise notified you of such changes.

As part of this process, you may be required to provide additional information to Sam’s Club to confirm your tax-exempt status (for example, a valid state tax-exempt number). You represent and warrant that any information you provide to Sam’s Club as part of the tax-exempt registration process is valid, accurate, and complete. You will promptly notify Sam’s Club of any updates or changes to your tax-exempt status and will promptly provide Sam’s Club with any updated information or documentation.

#### A. Arbitration Agreement.

EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND SAM’S CLUB, INCLUDING ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED OR SOLD BY SAM’S CLUB, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, YOU AND SAM’S CLUB AGREE THAT EACH IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BY A JURY. This paragraph may be referred to as the Arbitration Agreement in these Terms.

#### B. Class Action and Mass Action Waiver.

YOU AND SAM’S CLUB AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION REQUIRED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. You and Sam’s Club each agree to waive the right to have any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a class arbitration, class action, collective action, or Mass Action to the maximum extent permitted by law. “Mass Action” means a situation in which a party is represented by a law firm or other representative, or a collection of law firms or other representatives, that has initiated more than one hundred (100) arbitration Demands with common questions of law or fact against Sam’s Club within 180 days of initiating your arbitration Demand. This paragraph may be referred to as the “Class Action and Mass Action Waiver” in these Terms. Nothing in these Terms precludes you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local government agencies and, if the applicable law allows, such agencies may seek relief against Sam’s Club for you.

#### C. Initiating a Demand for Arbitration.

Any arbitration required by the Arbitration Agreement shall be initiated by You or Sam’s Club by sending the other a written demand for arbitration (“Demand”) only via first-class mail, FedEx, or UPS within the statute of limitations period. Your Demand shall be delivered to: Sam’s Club Legal Department, 702 SW 8th Street, Mailstop 0215, Bentonville, AR 72716. The Demand must include (i) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address of the person or entity seeking arbitration; (ii) a statement of the legal claims asserted and the factual basis for those claims; (iii) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (iv) the original personal signature of the party seeking arbitration; and (v) the original personal signature of any legal counsel or other representative purporting to represent the party seeking arbitration. For purposes of this paragraph, “original personal signature” does not include any digital, scanned, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature. An original personal signature on the Demand certifies the following: (i) the Demand is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The original personal signature by the party seeking arbitration shall verify under penalty of perjury that the factual statements contained in the Demand are true and correct. Compliance with this paragraph tolls any applicable statute of limitations as to any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement that is stated in the Demand.

#### D. Filing a Demand for Arbitration.

A party seeking arbitration of any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement shall submit a copy of the Demand to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) sixty (60) or more days after the Demand is initiated pursuant to Section X(C) of these Terms. The arbitration will be administered by the AAA pursuant to the current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, except to the extent modified by these Terms. The AAA rules and instructions are available on the AAA website at www.adr.org/consumer.

#### E. Conduct of Arbitration.

In any arbitration of a dispute or claim that is subject to the Arbitration Agreement:

1. You or Sam’s Club may file such dispositive motions as would be permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure without obtaining permission from the arbitrator. Upon the filing of any dispositive motion, the arbitrator may stay all further action and deadlines in the arbitration until deciding such motion.
2. The parties shall have the right to conduct such discovery from the opposing party or any third party that is proportional to the needs of the claim or dispute, considering the importance of the issues at stake, the amount in controversy, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Proportionality shall be decided by the arbitrator when requested by either party.
3. The arbitrator shall conduct any calls, conferences, or hearings by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person hearing will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient. You and an employee of Sam’s Club shall attend all arbitrator calls, conferences, and hearings.
4. A party may make a written offer of judgment at least seven (7) days before the date set for the arbitration hearing.
5. If the arbitrator finds that a party’s claim, counterclaim, or appeal was frivolous, asserted in bad faith, or pursued for purposes of harassment, the arbitrator shall award the opposing party its attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses and all amounts charged by AAA for the arbitration.
6. The arbitrator will follow these Terms and the law. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to commit errors of law or legal reasoning. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual party’s claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party, though the individual relief awarded by the arbitrator may incidentally affect non-parties.
7. You or Sam’s Club may appeal an arbitration award that manifestly disregards the law by filing a notice of appeal with the AAA within 30 days after an award is rendered and delivered to the parties. The appeal shall be heard by a single arbitrator unless the parties agree to a multi-arbitrator appellate panel. The arbitrator(s) assigned to the appeal shall be selected by agreement of the parties from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. If the parties are unable to agree, AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s) from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. An arbitrator who previously presided over any aspect of a case shall be ineligible from serving as an appellate arbitrator in that same case. The appeal, including briefing, shall be conducted pursuant to the parties’ agreement or the appellate arbitrator(s)’ orders if the parties are unable to agree.

#### F. Process for Arbitration Bellwether Demands.

If twenty-five (25) or more Demands for arbitration of a dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement are initiated (i) that involve common questions of law or fact and (ii) where the initiating parties are represented by the same law firm, the same group of coordinated law firms, or the same representative, then such Demands shall be coordinated pursuant to this paragraph. The group of claimants and group of respondents shall each select five (5) Demands, for a total of ten (10), to be filed with AAA (collectively the “Bellwether Demands”). Each of the Bellwether Demands shall be assigned by AAA to a different arbitrator chosen from its national roster. After ninety (90) days from the date all Bellwether Demands have been arbitrated and any appeals exhausted, any remaining Demands subject to this paragraph may be filed with AAA. The AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings shall apply to the extent they are not inconsistent with this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Terms, You and Sam’s Club agree that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce the terms of this paragraph with injunctive or other relief.

#### G. Severability.

If (i) any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement is filed as a class arbitration, class action, collective action, representative action, or Mass Action and (ii) if the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to such dispute or claim, then the Arbitration Agreement does not apply to that dispute or claim and such dispute or claim must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of Section X other than the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to a particular dispute or claim, then such provision shall be severed from the Terms, and the remainder of the Terms shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

#### H. Applicable Law.

The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section X of these Terms. If the FAA is found not to apply to any portion of Section X of these Terms, then the applicable laws of the State of Arkansas shall apply without regard to choice-of-law principles

Sam’s Club Refer a Friend Terms of Use
--------------------------------------

Sam’s Club may, from time to time, offer Sam’s Club members the opportunity to refer friends to try the Sam’s Club membership program ("Sam’s Club Referral Program"). We reserve the right to terminate the Sam’s Club Referral Program at any time for any reason without notice to you.

### Sam’s Club Referral Program Participation, Generally

To participate, Sam’s Club members will receive a ”Refer a Friend” email or text with a unique personal URL and must follow the instructions in the email or text and link to refer up friends, family members or colleagues to the Sam’s Club Referral Program. Sam’s Club who make referrals are called "Referrers." Individuals who receive a referral are called "Referred Customers." Referrers and Referred Customers who are fully-compliant with these terms of use will sometimes each earn Sam’s Club Referral Program incentives (“Incentives”) for every "Qualified Referral" as set forth further below and as set forth in the email.

### Eligible Referrer

1. be a legal resident of the United States of America;
2. be at least 18 years old;
3. have a valid active Sam’s Club membership; and
4. be in compliance with Sam’s Club Membership Terms and Condition, and comply with all of the terms set forth herein.

### Making and Receiving a Referral

To make referrals, you must receive an email or text with a unique referral link ("Personal Link") that you can copy and then send to friends, family members, or colleagues. Individuals to whom you send the Personal Link are Referred Customers. Personal Links may be issued only to individuals who can legally become a Sam’s Club member.

You cannot refer yourself. For example, you may not create multiple or fake accounts with Sam’s Club or participate in the Sam’s Club Referral Program using multiple or fake email addresses or identities.

Referred Customers will receive an email or text containing the Personal Link from their Eligible Referrer. Referred Customers must click the provided Personal Link, which will connect them to the enrollment process for a Sam’s Club membership. In order for the Eligible Referrer and Referred Customer to earn an Incentive, the Referred Customer must be eligible to establish a Sam’s Club membership account and must complete the required enrollment process (provided through the Personal Link), and after the expiration of any relevant trial membership period, their membership must convert to a fully-paid annual Sam’s Club membership.

1. The Referred Customer has enrolled in and paid an annual Sam’s Club membership and otherwise completed the registration process for a Sam’s Club membership, using the "Personal Link" provided by an Eligible Referrer as set forth above. If a Referred Customer enrolls in a Sam’s Club membership using any other link or method, the registration will not count as a Qualified Referral, and neither party will earn an Incentive.;
2. Referred Customer has not previously enrolled in a Sam’s Club membership (either trial or paid membership) under any email address or alias;
3. The Referred Customer is a) a legal resident of the United States of America and b) at least 18 years old; and

Incentives are not available for redemption on SamsClub.com or Curbside Pickup.

Referred Customers will receive one (1) Incentive valued up to $20 discount on the price of a Club-level Sam’s Club membership once the initial Referral becomes a Qualified Referral according to the terms set forth herein. This incentive may not be combined with other incentives, promotions or discounts.

All earned Incentives are subject to verification. Sam’s Club may delay issuing an Incentive for the purposes of investigation. Sam’s Club may also refuse to verify and process any transaction Sam’s Club deems, in its sole discretion, to be fraudulent, suspicious, in violation of these terms of use, or believes will impose potential liability on Sam’s Club, its subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents.

Incentives may not be redeemed by Referred Customers in Sam’s Club physical locations. Incentives may not be redeemed for cash.

### Bulk Distribution ("Spam")

Bulk email distribution, distribution to strangers, or any other promotion of a Personal Link in a manner that would constitute or appear to constitute unsolicited commercial email or "spam" in Sam’s Club sole discretion is expressly prohibited and may be grounds for immediate termination of your membership and deactivation of the Personal Link.

### Additional Terms, Conditions, Exclusions, and Restrictions ("Spam")

Additional terms, conditions, exclusions, and restrictions may apply to your use of Incentives; Incentives may expire if not used by the date specified in the delivery email (if any). Incentives accumulated under the Sam’s Club Referral Program have no monetary or cash value and are for individual use only and may not be transferred to any individual, group, company, or other entity. Any Incentives you have earned, as well as your membership account under the Sam’s Club Referral Program are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred, or assigned to, or shared with, family, friends, or others. We reserve the right (in our sole discretion) to deduct Incentives that were issued in error or that were not earned legitimately. Once an Incentive has been redeemed, redemption is considered final, and no changes may be made by you. Partial redemption of Incentives are not allowed. Incentives may not be reused. Participation in the Sam’s Club Referral Program and the receipt of or redemption of Incentives may result in tax liability to you.

We reserve the right to modify, limit, terminate, discontinue, or cancel the Sam’s Club Referral Program, its benefits, and these terms at any time in our sole discretion and without notice to you. At any time, we may change the monetary value of unissued Incentives, or cap the number of Incentives you may earn in any time period. The accumulation of Incentives does not entitle Sam’s Club Referral Program participants to any vested right with respect to the Incentives or the Sam’s Club Referral Program. You agree Sam’s Club or Walmart will not have any liability for any modification or termination of the Sam’s Club Referral Program, even if any modification or termination affects your ability to use any Incentives already accumulated. Upon termination of the Sam’s Club Referral Program, your Incentives may automatically be cancelled, and you will not be permitted to redeem those Incentives. Incentives are void where prohibited by applicable law. We are not responsible for Incentives lost through your own negligence, or due to fraudulent or unauthorized use of your account. You agree not to engage in fraud or abuse in the accumulation of Incentives or use of any Personal Links provided to you. Any fraud or abuse relating to your accumulation of Incentives or submission of Referred Customers may result in the annulment of all Incentives earned under the Sam’s Club Referral Program as well as cancellation of your account. We reserve the right to monitor all Sam’s Club Referral Program account activity and terminate your account and/or your participation in the Sam’s Club Referral Program if Sam’s Club believes (in its sole discretion) that you have violated these Terms of Use, or the Sam’s Club Membership Terms of Use or any other terms applicable to the Sam’s Club Referral Program, provided false or inaccurate information, abused the Sam’s Club Referral Program, or that the use of your account is unauthorized, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful or in violation of these terms. Sam’s Club will have final decision in any disputes over Incentives, Qualified Referrals, or your participation in the Sam’s Club Referral Program.

### GENERAL PROVISIONS, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION, AND APPLICABLE LAW

#### A. Arbitration Agreement.

EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND SAM’S CLUB, INCLUDING ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED OR SOLD BY SAM’S CLUB, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AND SAM’S CLUB AGREE THAT EACH IS WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BY A JURY. This paragraph may be referred to as the Arbitration Agreement in these Terms and Conditions.

#### B. Class Action and Mass Action Waiver.

YOU AND SAM’S CLUB AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION REQUIRED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. You and Sam’s Club each agree to waive the right to have any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a class arbitration, class action, collective action, or Mass Action to the maximum extent permitted by law. “Mass Action” means a situation in which a party is represented by a law firm or other representative, or a collection of law firms or other representatives, that has initiated more than one hundred (100) arbitration Demands with common questions of law or fact against Sam’s Club within 180 days of initiating your arbitration Demand. This paragraph may be referred to as the “Class Action and Mass Action Waiver” in these Terms and Conditions. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions precludes you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local government agencies and, if the applicable law allows, such agencies may seek relief against Sam’s Club for you.

#### C. Initiating a Demand for Arbitration.

Any arbitration required by the Arbitration Agreement shall be initiated by You or Sam’s Club by sending the other a written demand for arbitration (“Demand”) only via first-class mail, FedEx, or UPS within the statute of limitations period. Your Demand shall be delivered to: Sam’s Club Legal Department, 702 SW 8th Street, Mailstop 0215, Bentonville, AR 72716. The Demand must include (i) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address of the person or entity seeking arbitration; (ii) a statement of the legal claims asserted and the factual basis for those claims; (iii) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (iv) the original personal signature of the party seeking arbitration; and (v) the original personal signature of any legal counsel or other representative purporting to represent the party seeking arbitration. For purposes of this paragraph, “original personal signature” does not include any digital, scanned, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature. An original personal signature on the Demand certifies the following: (i) the Demand is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The original personal signature by the party seeking arbitration shall verify under penalty of perjury that the factual statements contained in the Demand are true and correct. Compliance with this paragraph tolls any applicable statute of limitations as to any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement that is stated in the Demand.

#### D. Filing a Demand for Arbitration.

A party seeking arbitration of any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement shall submit a copy of the Demand to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) sixty (60) or more days after the Demand is initiated pursuant these Terms and Conditions. The arbitration will be administered by the AAA pursuant to the current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, except to the extent modified by these Terms and Conditions. The AAA rules and instructions are available on the AAA website at www.adr.org/consumer.

#### E. Conduct of Arbitration.

In any arbitration of a dispute or claim that is subject to the Arbitration Agreement:

1. You or Sam’s Club may file such dispositive motions as would be permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure without obtaining permission from the arbitrator. Upon the filing of any dispositive motion, the arbitrator may stay all further action and deadlines in the arbitration until deciding such motion.
2. The parties shall have the right to conduct such discovery from the opposing party or any third party that is proportional to the needs of the claim or dispute, considering the importance of the issues at stake, the amount in controversy, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Proportionality shall be decided by the arbitrator when requested by either party.
3. The arbitrator shall conduct any calls, conferences, or hearings by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person hearing will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient. You and an employee of Sam’s Club shall attend all arbitrator calls, conferences, and hearings.
4. A party may make a written offer of judgment at least seven (7) days before the date set for the arbitration hearing.
5. If the arbitrator finds that a party’s claim, counterclaim, or appeal was frivolous, asserted in bad faith, or pursued for purposes of harassment, the arbitrator shall award the opposing party its attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses and all amounts charged by AAA for the arbitration.
6. The arbitrator will follow these Terms and Conditions and the law. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to commit errors of law or legal reasoning. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual party’s claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party, though the individual relief awarded by the arbitrator may incidentally affect non-parties.
7. You or Sam’s Club may appeal an arbitration award that manifestly disregards the law by filing a notice of appeal with the AAA within 30 days after an award is rendered and delivered to the parties. The appeal shall be heard by a single arbitrator unless the parties agree to a multi-arbitrator appellate panel. The arbitrator(s) assigned to the appeal shall be selected by agreement of the parties from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. If the parties are unable to agree, AAA shall appoint the arbitrator(s) from among those on the AAA Appellate Panel. An arbitrator who previously presided over any aspect of a case shall be ineligible from serving as an appellate arbitrator in that same case. The appeal, including briefing, shall be conducted pursuant to the parties’ agreement or the appellate arbitrator(s)’ orders if the parties are unable to agree.

#### F. Process for Arbitration Bellwether Demands.

If twenty-five (25) or more Demands for arbitration of a dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement are initiated (i) that involve common questions of law or fact and (ii) where the initiating parties are represented by the same law firm, the same group of coordinated law firms, or the same representative, then such Demands shall be coordinated pursuant to this paragraph. The group of claimants and group of respondents shall each select five (5) Demands, for a total of ten (10), to be filed with AAA (collectively the “Bellwether Demands”). Each of the Bellwether Demands shall be assigned by AAA to a different arbitrator chosen from its national roster. After ninety (90) days from the date all Bellwether Demands have been arbitrated and any appeals exhausted, any remaining Demands subject to this paragraph may be filed with AAA. The AAA Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings shall apply to the extent they are not inconsistent with this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Terms and Conditions, You and Sam’s Club agree that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce the terms of this paragraph with injunctive or other relief.

#### G. Severability.

If (i) any dispute or claim subject to the Arbitration Agreement is filed as a class arbitration, class action, collective action, representative action, or Mass Action and (ii) if the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to such dispute or claim, then the Arbitration Agreement does not apply to that dispute or claim and such dispute or claim must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision other than the Class Action and Mass Action Waiver is held invalid or unenforceable as to a particular dispute or claim, then such provision shall be severed from the Terms and Conditions, and the remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

#### H. Applicable Law.

The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and Conditions. If the FAA is found not to apply to any portion of these Terms and Conditions, then the applicable laws of the State of Arkansas shall apply without regard to choice-of-law principles

Irrespective of the payment method used for initial purchase, a valid preferred card is needed on file to complete checkout of a third-party service subscription.

### IV. Third-Party Service Subscription Billing

**The price, plus any applicable taxes, for a third-party service subscription is disclosed to you when you place your order. You will be charged when you place your order, regardless of when you activate or start the service subscription with the third party. You will then be automatically charged on a recurring basis at the interval you have selected (e.g., monthly) unless and until you change or cancel your third-party service subscription**. Note that the service subscription price may change at any time, and the price will change if your Sam's Club membership tier changes. See the table in Section V, below, for details. You agree to waive the right to receive notice of all variations in price, and instead agree to receive such notice only if the price for the third-party service subscription increases by more than twenty dollars ($20.00). In such a case, and if the payment method you selected, or that Sam's Club will charge, is a debit or prepaid card, Sam's Club will provide you with notice at least ten (10) days in advance of the next recurring charge at the higher price, and you will have the option to cancel your subscription. The notice will be sent to the email associated with your SamsClub.com account.

The price, plus any applicable taxes, for each interval (e.g., each month) will be billed to the payment method selected by you on the subscriptions page of your SamsClub.com account, subject to Section III (Accepted Payment Methods) above. If we are unable to complete payment for your third-party service subscription with the payment method you selected to purchase your third-party service subscription (for example, because that payment method has expired or is otherwise unavailable), you agree that we may charge any other payment method stored in your SamsClub.com account until you select a new designated payment method. If no payment methods in your account can be used, your service subscription will be canceled by Sam's Club unless or until you update your payment method information in your SamsClub.com account. Please remember to update your payment method information as necessary to avoid delays or cancelations. Your third-party service subscription will otherwise remain in effect until it is canceled by you or Sam's Club.

Any free-trial period for a third-party service subscription will begin on the date of purchase on SamsClub.com. You will be automatically charged for the third-party service subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless you cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the free-trial ends. See Section V, below, for instructions on how to cancel. If you upgrade your third-party service subscription during the free trial period, you will lose your free trial, and Sam's Club will charge you immediately for the upgraded third-party service subscription plan.

### V. Changing and Canceling Third-Party Service Subscriptions

If you choose to purchase a third-party service subscription, you will continue to receive the subscription until you change or cancel the subscription or your Sam's Club membership. You can change or cancel your third-party service subscription on the subscriptions page in your SamsClub.com account. From there, you can also modify or update your payment method. You must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of your current interval in order to avoid being charged for the next interval of your third-party service subscription. For example, if your subscription is monthly, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the current monthly billing interval in order to avoid a charge for the next monthly interval, and if your subscription is annual, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the current annual billing interval in order to avoid a charge for the next annual interval.
