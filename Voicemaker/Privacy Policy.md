Data Protection and Security Policy
===================================

Last Updated: November 10, 2024

At Voicemaker, we prioritize the security, privacy, and confidentiality of your data. We understand that your privacy and confidentiality are important to you, and we share those concerns. We are dedicated to treating the information of our customers, employees, stakeholders, and other interested parties with the highest level of care and confidentiality. This page has been created to address any questions you may have regarding the use, storage, sharing, and deletion of your data.

  

#### Key Principles of Data Security:

* **Project Confidentiality:** Your projects are kept strictly confidential, with access limited solely to you. Voicemaker team members have no access to your projects from the backend, as everything is encrypted at source and only end-user can access it. Even if you request assistance, we handle it securely by asking for relevant screenshots and necessary details from you, without direct access to your files. Any support requests are managed securely, ensuring that your work remains private and protected at all times.
* **Data Protection:** If you choose to delete your data from Voicemaker, we ensure its permanent removal from our servers. We do not retain any backup or redundancy copies of your data.
* **PCI DSS Compliance:** We comply with PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry, Data Security Standard.
* **ISO/IEC 27001 Certification in Progress:** Voicemaker is currently in the process of obtaining certification for ISO/IEC 27001, which focuses on Information security.
* **Security Testing:** Voicemaker regularly conducts Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) reports & OpenVAS scans to mitigate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Enterprise users can request access to our latest VAPT reports by reaching out to our support team.

  

#### Our Core Security Practices:

* **Data Classification and Sensitivity Levels:** At Voicemaker, we classify every single data as "highly sensitive" to ensure maximum protection across the board. This means that every piece of information entrusted to us—whether personal details, project files, or payment data—receives the highest level of security. **End-to-End Encryption:** Any data uploaded to Voicemaker is stored in an encrypted MongoDB Atlas database & AWS S3 (data files) while at rest. Any time your data is “in transit,” it is encrypted over HTTPS (256-bit encryption), the industry standard for secure internet transactions. This means that the data you send to and from Voicemaker is secure, even if your network is not secure, such as when you’re on a public Wi-Fi network.
* **Project Access Controls:** At Voicemaker nor any of our employees will ever have access to your project or work, even from backend. It remains completely your property, and any information related to it is kept confidential. We only know your work when it is shared by you with our support team for resolving any conversion issues or errors. Once the issue is resolved, we delete your work promptly. Our employees do not have the right to store it on their personal systems or access your cloud saved files.
* **User Rights and Deletion Policy:**Users have full rights to access, correct, and delete their data. Voicemaker enables easy data export and deletion processes to give users control. However, Voicemaker reserves explicit right to delete a user's account if they violate our Terms of Service.
* **Data Minimization:** We carefully assess the data we need to provide a high-quality, reliable service and to enhance the user experience. This includes data such as project files for text-to-speech conversion, login credentials for account security, and basic contact information for communication. We avoid gathering any information that isn’t directly relevant to our service or that doesn’t contribute to a user benefit.
* **User Access Controls and Monitoring:**For External Users (Customers): We use Cloudflare's default security tools to monitor user's authentication and protect our systems from malicious requests. This setup helps track customer interactions with their data, ensuring robust security and privacy while safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential threats.  
    For Internal Users (Employees): Every Voicemaker employee uses Cloudflare Zero Trust and Cloudflare Warp VPN to securely connect to our backend networks and infrastructure. This ensures that only verified devices can access our backend network, continuously monitors traffic to block unauthorized access, and protects against risks like data leaks and shadow IT. With strict access controls and ongoing monitoring, we make sure that only the right people handle sensitive information, keeping your data safe every step of the way. This framework secures employee access with strict authentication, reducing unauthorized access and potential data leaks. **Non-Company Device Use:** External devices are required to pass security checks before accessing Voicemaker network and cannot log in without Cloudflare Zero Trust and WARP, ensuring an additional layer of security.
* **Secure Payment:** We prioritise payment security, which is why we have teamed up with industry-leading payment transfer companies to ensure the utmost protection for our clients' payment information. At present, we proceed your payments using Stripe, PayPal & RazorPay.
* **Account Security:** We encrypt all login information, including emails, passwords, project data, and files, to ensure secure storage within our database. We strongly encourage users to create strong, unique passwords and avoid sharing or storing their login credentials digitally. Voicemaker only can reset a user’s password upon explicit request, ensuring full control over account access. For added security, we also offer Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), which requires multiple verification steps to access accounts, adding an extra layer of protection.
* **AI Model Usage and Data:** We respect your data privacy and are committed to ensuring that your data is solely yours. Voicemaker does not use or even knew about any of your data—whether text or audio files—for training or improving our AI models without your explicit consent. Any AI-related data processing is done with full transparency, maintaining strict boundaries around user confidentiality. Furthermore, any data processed and created by our AI is encrypted and handled with the highest security standards, ensuring that only you retain access and ownership rights. This data protection strategy allows us to deliver a powerful AI experience without sacrificing user privacy or confidentiality.
* **Secure Data Storage & Backup Policy:** We securely store user data and web-data in an end-to-end encrypted MongoDB Atlas database, with regular backups and continuous replication across multiple droplets for added resilience. Audio files are safely stored on AWS S3 with built-in backup options. Our core platform & Voice AI Models operates on Amazon AWS EC2 (us-west-2) and Google Cloud (us-west1-a) servers, with automated hourly backup snapshots. These snapshots are then encrypted and transferred daily to other servers, ensuring secure, off-site backup storage. **Isolation:** Our systems are built to keep user data isolated, preventing any unauthorized cross-access and ensuring that each user’s data remains strictly separated and protected.
* **Incident Response and Data Breach Protocol:** We maintain a transparent incident response plan to handle data breaches promptly. In the event of a breach, we promptly assess, contain, and resolve the issue, notifying users of any potential risks and implementing immediate safeguards to protect their data.
* **Third-Party Vendor Risk Management:** At Voicemaker, we carefully assess the security practices of any third-party vendors we engage to ensure they align with our stringent data protection standards. Each vendor must meet Voicemaker's security and privacy benchmarks before integration. Our core infra and AI models are hosted exclusively on our hosted servers, minimizing reliance on third-party vendors and reducing associated security risks. **Fourth-Nth Party Utilization:** For certain services, we utilize third-party providers, ensuring each one meets Voicemaker’s security and privacy standards. No unauthorized sharing of personally identifiable information occurs.
* **Regular Security Assessments and Audits:** We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments using tools like OpenVAS, Qualys, and Detectify, alongside Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS CloudTrail for continuous monitoring and threat detection, ensuring all system components are up-to-date and resilient against potential vulnerabilities. For kernel updates and system hardening, we utilize tools like Tripwire and OSSEC to monitor for unauthorized changes, alongside automated patch management tools for timely kernel and software updates.
* **Compliance with Legal Standards and Regulations:** Voicemaker complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection laws, ensuring user privacy and control over their data. We are also in the process of obtaining ISO/IEC 27001 certification, which demonstrates our commitment to comprehensive information security practices and standards.
* **Employee Training and Data Protection Policies:** At Voicemaker, all employees undergo regular training on data privacy and security best practices to stay informed about the latest developments and threats in cybersecurity. Our Data Protection Officer oversees data handling practices, ensuring compliance with all security policies and coordinating efforts to secure our users. **Staff Augmentation:** For specialized projects, we utilize staff augmentation while strictly enforcing our security protocols. All third-party personnel are required to adhere to Voicemaker’s rigorous security standards and confidentiality agreements, ensuring that our high standards of data protection extend to every team member.
* **Data Protection Officer:** Voicemaker has put in place a set of internal policies and procedures regarding data protection, which all employees are required to adhere to. The collaboration between our Data Protection Officer and engineering team ensures that we maintain complete visibility on the user data we possess, its storage location, and authorized access. To ensure compliance with these policies and prompt communication of data protection matters to our CEO, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer. The Officer is responsible for enforcing the policies and overseeing the protection of data.
* **Continuous Improvement and Security Updates:** Using industry-leading tools, we continuously monitor and update our security practices to address emerging threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring robust protection.
* **Privacy by Design and Default:** By our core principle - "Encrypt Everything", our privacy standards are embedded into our systems from the ground up, ensuring your data is secure without the need for adjustments, so you can trust that your information is protected. Our commitment is simple: to protect your privacy at every step, with strong encryption and built-in safeguards that respect your data and give you peace of mind.
  

##### Infrastructure Security:

* **DDoS protection:** We use "Cloudflare" to enhance the security, speed, and reliability of Voicemaker’s main platform and its API, providing features such as DDoS protection, SSL encryption, email protection, Argo Smart Routing and various built-in tools.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** We use Cloudflare’s WAF to protect our web applications from security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and DDoS attacks. This advanced firewall adds a crucial layer of defense, ensuring a secure and seamless experience for our users.
* **Zero Trust:** As previously mentioned, we rely on Cloudflare Zero Trust to secure access to all backend networks. This system rigorously authenticates every employee login, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data leaks.
* **Uptime and Monitoring:** We use AWS CloudWatch to monitor CPU, RAM, and disk usage, with automated alerts triggered when resource thresholds are reached. By tracking system health and performance through data logs, we ensure optimal service levels are maintained. For real-time system uptime, visit our [status page](https://status.voicemaker.in/).
* **Data Storage:** As previously mentioned, all data, including Voicemaker’s AI models, is securely stored on Amazon AWS (us-west-2) and Google Cloud (us-west1-a) servers. These secure environments ensure robust data protection and reliable performance.
* **Physical Security:** At Voicemaker, once an employee’s device connects to the network, we rely on leading cloud providers like Amazon AWS and Google Cloud to ensure robust physical security for our platform and your data. These world-class data centers adhere to strict physical security protocols, undergo regular security audits, and comply with certifications such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS, confirming that they meet high standards for physical and information security.
