Data Protection and Security Policy
===================================

Last Updated: March 10, 2023

At Voicemaker, we prioritize the security, privacy, and confidentiality of your data. We understand that your privacy and confidentiality are important to you, and we share those concerns. We are dedicated to treating the information of our customers, employees, stakeholders, and other interested parties with the highest level of care and confidentiality. This page has been created to address any questions you may have regarding the use, storage, sharing, and deletion of your data.

##### Here is a summary of our policies, followed by a detailed Q&A:

* Your Projects are confidential, even from Voicemaker.
* If you choose to delete your data from Voicemaker, we permanently delete it from our servers.
* We are PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry, Data Security Standard) compliant company.
* Voicemaker is currently in the process of obtaining certification for ISO/IEC 27001, which focuses on Information security.
* Voicemaker conducts periodic Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) reports & OpenVAS scans to mitigate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

  

#### How does Voicemaker protect my data?

##### We use SSL Certificate & encrypt it

Any data uploaded to Voicemaker is stored in an encrypted MongoDB Atlas database while at rest. Any time your data is “in transit,” it is encrypted over HTTPS, the industry standard for secure internet transactions. This means that the data you send to and from Voicemaker is secure, even if your network is not secure, such as when you’re on a public Wi-Fi network.

  

##### Strict no project access

At Voicemaker nor any of our employees will ever have access to your project or work. It remains completely your property, and any information related to it is kept confidential.

We only access your work when it is shared by you with our support team for resolving any conversion issues or errors. Once the issue is resolved, we delete your work promptly. Our employees do not have the right to store it on their personal systems or access your cloud saved files.

  

##### Third-party highly secured systems for payments

We prioritise payment security, which is why we have teamed up with industry-leading payment transfer companies to ensure the utmost protection for our clients' payment information. At present, we proceed your payments using Stripe, PayPal & RazorPay.

  

##### Login Information

We encrypt all login information, including email and passwords, in our database. We strongly encourage users to create the strongest possible passwords and to never share or digitally store their login credentials. Please note that Voicemaker is only authorized to reset a user's password at the explicit request of the user.

  

##### We have a Data Protection Officer

Voicemaker has put in place a set of internal policies and procedures regarding data protection, which all employees are required to adhere to. The collaboration between our Data Protection Officer and engineering team ensures that we maintain complete visibility on the user data we possess, its storage location, and authorized access.

To ensure compliance with these policies and prompt communication of data protection matters to our CEO, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer. The Officer is responsible for enforcing the policies and overseeing the protection of data.

##### Our commitment to data protection includes the following actions:

* We restrict and monitor access to sensitive data.
* We develop transparent procedures for data collection.
* We train our employees in online privacy and security measures.
* We build secure networks to protect online data from cyberattacks.
* We establish clear procedures for reporting privacy breaches or data misuse.
* We communicate our data handling practices through contract clauses or statements.
* We establish data protection practices such as document shredding, secure locks, data encryption, frequent backups, and access authorization.

Additionally, we provide privacy provisions for Voicemaker users and subscribers on our website.

  

#### How does Voicemaker use my data?

Voicemaker keeps a record of your Project Information, including the files you upload to the platform, the text that has been converted to speech, audio files, and other metadata within a Project, on our servers. This feature enables us to provide you with various benefits, such as live collaboration, complete version history of your Projects, and the ability to access your Projects from any computer.

We don't use your Project Information for anything other than providing the service we offer — e.g. we don’t sell it; we don’t use it for marketing; we don’t use it for advertising.

Your Project Information is confidential from us. The exception is if you specifically ask us to look at a Project for the purpose of customer service, or if you explicitly opt-in to sharing Project Information (e.g. The results of your automatic text-to-speech converts) with us for the purpose of improving the quality of the algorithms we use to provide our service.

  

##### Name, email address, password and billing details

**Name** - To personalize your experience with Voicemaker, we use your name. Instead of addressing you as "User", we address you by your actual name, such as "Hi, Johnny." When you collaborate on a Project with other users on Voicemaker, your collaborators will also see your name when you interact with them by leaving a comment or sharing a Project.

**Email** - Your email address serves as your primary identifier in Voicemaker and also serves as the main point of contact for us to communicate with you.

**Password** - Upon logging in, we utilize your password to verify and validate your account.

**Billing details** - When you sign up for a paid account, we collect billing details including your credit card information and billing address. We use this information to collect payments. (We do not have access to your credit/debit card numbers or CVCs since they are handled by our payment gateways such as Stripe, PayPal & RazorPay.)
