Privacy Policy
==============

Date of Last Revision: February 01, 2024

1) Introduction
---------------

Thank you for using Toptal’s websites and services that link to this Privacy Policy, including toptal.com (the **“Sites”**). Toptal, LLC (**“Toptal,”** “**we,**” “**us,**” and/or “**our**”) operates these Sites to provide our users (“**you**” and “**your**”) with tools and information about Toptal and our services.

Toptal sources and matches the world’s top freelancers (“**Freelancers**”) in a variety of fields with clients who need the Freelancer’s skills and expertise (“**Clients**”). Toptal also operates tools across our Sites that support Freelancers and Clients, such as our time tracking tool, [TopTracker](https://www.toptal.com/tracker/). Our tools, sourcing and matching service, and other offerings, such as matching Clients with groups of Talent or providing outcomes-based deliverables, are referred as the “**Services**” for this policy.

Toptal screens Freelancers with skills in areas such as software development, design, finance, product management, and project management to curate a proprietary network of highly skilled Freelancers (the “**Network**”). We call Freelancers in the Network “**Talent**” or Top Talent, which is the origin of the name Toptal.

Toptal values your privacy rights, and we take our responsibilities and obligations about your privacy rights seriously. We want you to know that Toptal is not in the business of selling your information. This privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) explains our data practices in depth, so that you know how and why we collect and use your information in compliance with applicable data regulations.

* * *

2) Scope
--------

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, retain, and use information, including personal data (“**Personal Data**”), about Freelancers, Talents, Clients, potential Clients, Site visitors, vendors, blog readers, and job applicants, and others in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations as described below.

### a) Freelancers, Including Talents

#### i) Information We Collect

##### 1\. **Information That You Provide to Us**

We collect information from applicants and during [our screening process](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) we need to evaluate your qualifications such as your language skills, personality, domain-specific knowledge, competence, professionalism, and technical skills. If we admit you as a Talent, we may also collect this information throughout your time in the Network. We may ask you to provide information about yourself, which could include your:

* Name;
* Contact information;
* Address;
* Location;
* Work experience;
* Education;
* References;
* Photo;
* Government-issued identification;
* Social network information; and
* Billing information.

During the screening process or your time as a Talent, we may also record your audio and video calls with us or with Clients to help document your skills or to be used for our quality assurance or training purposes. Toptal provides Talent and our internal team members the use of a toptal.com email address. Toptal stores and processes information sent to and from all toptal.com email addresses.

##### 2\. **Biometric Data and Retention**

We may request that you provide information to verify and confirm your identity. As part of this identity verification, we may ask you to take a photo of yourself and of your government-issued identification through an application on your mobile phone or computer (the “**Verification Data**”). The Verification Data is provided to our biometric technology service provider (currently, LexisNexis Risk Solutions FL Inc. – “**LexisNexis**”). LexisNexis completes such verifications through its approved third-party identification verification provider, Veriff OÜ (“**Veriff**”), who uses facial recognition technology to analyze the geometry of your face through the photographs you provide and extracts biometric information or biometric identifiers relating to you (collectively, “**Biometric Data**”), as well as validates the legitimacy of your government-issued identification to confirm your identity. LexisNexis sends us the Verification Data that indicates whether Veriff was able to verify your identity, and the details from your government-issued identification for reference and fraud investigation purposes pursuant to our legitimate interests. LexisNexis securely stores a copy of your government-issued identification for as long as there is a continued and legitimate need for our verification of your identity in accordance with direction from Toptal. Toptal also retains the results and related Verification and Biographical Data, for as long as an account related to the individual being verified is active, for its legitimate purpose of verifying the identities of people applying or receiving services; to assist in complying with applicable laws and regulations; and/or to help prevent and investigate fraud and other violations of our systems.

As part of our screening process, we may require additional information to verify your identity in this remote environment. A member of our team may request additional details, such as your relevant address, (collectively, “**Biographical Data**”) to verify your identity. The Biographical Data is provided to our identity verification service provider depending on your location and processed based on its related privacy policy:

* United States: [LexisNexis Consumer Instant ID](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/corporate/privacy-policy)
* Germany, Italy, Austria, or Switzerland: [Crif](https://crif.co.uk/privacy-policy/)
* Netherlands: [CDDN](https://www.cddn.nl/en/privacy-cookie-statement/)
* Any other location: [Global Data Consortium (“**GDC**”)](https://www.lseg.com/en/policies/privacy-and-cookie-statement)

LexisNexis also uses the Verification Data and Biographical Data to improve the accuracy, reliability, usability, and functionality of its identity verification technology, for fraud prevention and incident investigation efforts.

LexisNexis does not sell nor retain your Biometric Data and permanently deletes it within twenty-four hours after sending us the information on whether your identity and government-issued identification have been verified. As noted above, Toptal does not receive the Biometric Data. In no event does LexisNexis or Veriff retain Biometric Data for longer than the purpose described above, or three years from your last interaction with Toptal, whichever is earlier unless required by law. Please refer to LexisNexis’ [Privacy Policy](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/corporate/privacy-policy) for more information.

##### 3\. **Sharing Your Biometric Data**

LexisNexis may share your Biometric Data and Verification Data with Veriff to provide the verification services. For more information on how LexisNexis handles your Verification Data and Biometric Data, please review LexisNexis’ [website](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/products/risknarrative) and [Privacy Policy](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/corporate/privacy-policy), or Veriff’s [website](https://www.veriff.com/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.veriff.com/privacy-notice).

If you are a California resident, you, or a person verifiably authorized to act on your behalf, have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act and its successor legislation, the California Privacy Rights Act, collectively the “CCPA.” For the purpose of this section, certain words, including “sale,” “share,” “business purpose,” and “personal information” have the meanings defined in the CCPA. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we use “Personal Data” to cover “personal information” as defined in the CCPA.

We update our Privacy Policy based on our current practices. As required by the CCPA, the information in this section is relevant for the last twelve-month time period. During that time, we collected the categories of Personal Data listed in the relevant section above (i.e., Freelancers, Clients, Job Applicants, or Site Visitors) from the sources listed in those sections (i.e., from you, third parties, or automatically). During the last twelve-month period, we have not sold Personal Data.

During the last twelve-month period, we disclosed for business purposes the following categories of Personal Data:

* Identifiers (i.e., names, email addresses, or online identifiers and IP addresses).
* Biometric information (i.e., video and voice recordings).
* Internet activity (i.e., information regarding your interaction with our websites or advertisements).
* Geolocation data (i.e., information regarding where you access our site from).
* Professional or employment information (i.e., job title, employer, or prior titles and employers).

For information about who we may share or disclose your Personal Data to, please review the relevant information in the above Freelancers, Clients, Job Applicants, or Site Visitors sections.

Your rights under the CCPA include the following, which you may execute by contacting us at privacy@toptal.com where possible and allowed by law:

* **Right to request deletion of your Personal Data.** You may ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data. If we shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the deletion where possible. If you ask us, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data with so you can contact them directly.
* **Right to request Toptal correct inaccurate Personal Data.** If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to ask that we correct or complete it. If we shared your Personal Data with others, we will tell them about the correction where possible. If you ask us, we will also tell you with whom we shared your Personal Data so you can contact them directly.
* **Right to know what Personal Data is sold or shared and with whom**. Toptal is not in the business of selling your Personal Data. You may ask us to clarify what Personal Data, if any, is shared and with whom we share it, along with certain additional details.
* **Right to opt out of sale or sharing of Personal Data for behavioral advertising and right to not be retaliated against for opting out**. If you would like to opt out of Toptal sharing your Personal Data with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, you have the right to do so. To opt out:
    * Email your request to [privacy@toptal.com](mailto:privacy@toptal.com); and
    * Disable the use of analytics/advertising cookies as we describe in our Cookie Policy. You must complete this step on each of our websites from each browser and on each device that you use.
    * If you block cookies, we may be unable to comply with your opt out request with respect to device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies. If you clear your cookies, you may need to disable the use of all advertising cookies again.
* **Right to access your Personal Data**. If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data and, if so, provide you with a copy of that Personal Data along with certain other details. If you require additional copies, we may charge a reasonable fee.
* **Shine the Light Requests**. You may also request that we provide you with a list of the categories of Personal Data, if any, that we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year and the identity of those third parties.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination**. Toptal will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of your rights under the CCPA.

If you would like to exercise your rights or have questions about your rights or information, please contact us at privacy@toptal.com or at the post addresses included in the Contacting Toptal section below.
