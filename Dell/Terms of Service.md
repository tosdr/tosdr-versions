============

**About These Terms of Use**These terms (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and Dell Technologies and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (“Dell”). The Terms control your use and access to Dell’s websites and online information (the “Sites” or “Site”). By using Dell’s Sites, you agree to these Terms. Dell may revise these Terms at any time by updating this page. You should revisit this page from time to time to determine what terms govern your use of the Site.

**License Disclaimer and Use Restrictions**Nothing on any Dell Site gives you any license under any Dell or third party intellectual property rights. All intellectual property rights in this Site belong to Dell or other parties that licensed their material to Dell. Subject to these Terms, Dell grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive right to access and use the Site and the materials and information on the Site (“Dell Content”). This limited license is only for your personal, noncommercial use. You must keep Dell’s proprietary notices on any copies you make of Dell Content. Unauthorized use of Dell Content may violate copyright, trademark, privacy, communications, or other laws. You are responsible to Dell for your unauthorized use of Dell Content. This right terminates automatically if you breach any part of these Terms. Upon termination, you must immediately destroy any Dell Content in your possession or control. Other than as stated above, you must not:

* change, alter, copy, distribute, republish, download, display, post, or send the Dell Content in any form or by any means without Dell’s or the copyright owner’s prior written permission, unless the Site states otherwise about specific Dell Content;
* use the Site or Dell Content for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms;
* use the Site to solicit any activity that is illegal or may infringe upon the rights of others;
* “mirror” or “frame” any Dell Content on any other device without Dell’s written permission;
* use the Dell Content to benchmark any Dell Content against any other person’s or entity’s products, services or information; or
* use the Dell Logo or any other Dell trademark as a "hot" link to any part of the Site unless Dell approves that use in writing.

**Miscellaneous**

* These Terms do not create any legal relationship between you and Dell.

* If a court or other tribunal finds any provision of these Terms unenforceable, Dell will change that provision only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Other terms will remain in full force and effect.
* Any interpretation of these Terms will look at fair meaning, and ambiguities must not be construed for or against any party.

**Governing Law; Dispute Resolution  
**You agree that the laws of the state of Texas will govern any claim or dispute relating to these Terms, the Site, Dell Content, your access to and use of the Site, or any combination of these items (the “**Dispute**”), without regard to Texas conflicts of laws principles. You agree to submit to, and waive any objection to, the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located within Travis County, Texas. . Before you or Dell file any lawsuit regarding a Dispute, you and Dell will attempt to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or through mediation using a mutually agreeable mediator. You and Dell will treat the existence or results of any negotiation or mediation as confidential. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty days of notice of the Dispute to the other party, the parties will be free to pursue all remedies available at law or equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party has the right to seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to preserve the status quo, prevent irreparable harm, avoid the expiration of any applicable limitation periods, or preserve a superior position with respect to other creditors.
