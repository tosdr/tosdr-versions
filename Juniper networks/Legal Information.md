**What We Do**

We, Juniper Networks, Inc., 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, California 94089 USA, and other companies in Juniper Networks, Inc.’s group worldwide, including Mist Systems, Inc. (collectively, “Juniper Networks”), provide network infrastructure products, services, and solutions for enterprise networks, for the cloud and for service providers (collectively, the “Juniper Products”). Our technology includes, for example, routers, switches, network management software and network security products, both wired and wireless. You can find examples of our products, solutions, and services on our [website](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products.html).

We typically distribute Juniper Products through resellers and channel partners. When Juniper Products are used by our customers and channel partners on their own premises and in their own cloud account(s), we generally do not have access to the personal data processed by the Juniper Products unless we are providing installation services, customer support or success services, quality assurance, testing or other professional services.

When we do have access to personal data of individuals, it is typically as a service provider/supplier to our customers and channel partners, with limited exceptions, such as, for example:

* For our websites [Juniper.net](https://www.juniper.net/us/en.html) and [Mist.com](https://www.mist.com/), related sub-sites and other websites and mobile applications (_e.g._, Juniper Support Portal) that we provide (collectively “Our Websites”).
* For our advertising, marketing, promotion, industry outreach and educational efforts (which are primarily in a business-to-business context versus direct-to-consumer).
* In our relationships with our service providers.

In our role as a service provider/supplier, our contracts generally restrict us from processing personal data of our customers and channel partners except for the purposes permitted under our contracts and under applicable law. We do not “sell” (as defined by certain privacy laws) personal data of individuals, except to the extent such term includes “sharing” (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising or the use of your personal data for targeted advertising, as discussed [here](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/privacy-policy/united-states-supplement.html).

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

Juniper Networks respects and is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. Together with the additional information at the links available above, this Privacy Notice (the “Notice”) describes our personal data processing, including in connection with the Juniper Products. This Notice is provided to current and prospective customers, channel partners, service providers, OEMs, distributors, end users of any Juniper Products, visitors to, and users of, Our Websites, and other third parties. Information on the protection of privacy relating to job applicants is provided in our [Recruiting Privacy Notice](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/privacy-policy/recruiting-privacy-policy.html). Additional license terms, terms of use, contracts, agreements, and privacy statements may also apply to particular Juniper Products. If there are contradictions between this Notice and the more specific information for a particular Juniper Product, the more specific information shall prevail to the extent permitted under applicable law.

**Information We May Collect**

Juniper Networks has service providers, affiliates, subsidiaries, and operations globally, including within the United States, and may transfer your personal data on a global basis to operate its business. If Juniper Networks transfers personal data to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection, Juniper Networks will take measures designed to adequately protect your personal data, such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses or any other applicable data transfer mechanisms.

**Security of Personal Data**

Juniper Networks safeguards the security of personal data with industry-standard physical, technical, and organizational measures. Juniper Networks secures Personal Data in controlled servers with limited access.

When you use Our Websites, you are transferring information to the United States and other locations where Juniper Networks or its service providers operate. While we strive to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the personal data provided to us, as no transmission of information through the Internet can be completely secure. We urge individuals to protect their personal data when using the Internet by, for example, changing passwords often and using a combination of letters and numbers, and making sure to use a secure browser.

If we learn of and confirm the occurrence of a security incident leading to the misappropriation, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, your personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed on Juniper Networks’ systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of your personal data, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on Our Websites or by sending you an email. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing or in any other form required by applicable law.

**Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

Juniper Networks and our service providers use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as web beacons and device identifiers) to recognize visitors to Our Websites and provide those users with certain website functionality. For more information, see our [Cookies and Tracking Technologies Notice](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/privacy-policy/cookies-and-tracking-technologies-notice.html).

**Retention of Personal Data**

Juniper Networks will retain your personal data as needed to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, including to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. For Juniper Products, the criteria used to determine the retention period for specific categories of personal data varies and is based on what is required to deliver that product or service.

**Job Applicants**
