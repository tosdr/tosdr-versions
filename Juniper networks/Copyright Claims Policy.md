==============================================

**Reporting Claims of Copyright and Trademark Infringement**  

Juniper Networks, Inc. respects the intellectual property rights of others and expect users of its websites or websites of its affiliates (collectively, the “Services”) to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. We may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, in addition to our other remedies, terminate, discontinue, suspend and/or restrict the account/profile or ability to access, visit, and/or use the Services for users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and we may choose to remove, delete, erase, or disable access to content deemed to be infringing.

**DMCA Policy and Copyright Infringement**

If you have reason to believe that your content has been copied and/or is accessible on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that the Services contains links or other references to another site, application, destination or service that contains content or activity that infringes your copyright rights, you may notify us by providing a document via first class U.S. mail or email that includes the following information (as required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512), the text of which may be found on the [U.S. Copyright Office website](http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf), to our copyright agent (DMCA Agent) set forth below:

* Provide your full legal name and your electronic or physical signature.
* Provide information reasonably sufficient to enable us to contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).
