Bitly Terms of Service
======================

Updated: September 2024

Bitly, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “Bitly,” “we” or “our”) provide URL shortening, custom-branded link, link management, link-in-bio, QR code and analytics products and services to our users (collectively, the “Bitly Services”). Please read these Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) carefully, as they govern your access to and use of the Bitly Services and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Bitly. If you accept this Agreement or use the Bitly Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the Agreement and, in such event, “you” “your” or “Customer” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity. If you have been granted access to and use of the Bitly Services by and on behalf of the primary account holder, whether directly or through an administrator, you also agree to abide by this Agreement. In addition to this Agreement, your use of the Bitly Services is governed by the Bitly [Privacy Policy, the](https://bitly.com/pages/privacy) [Bitly Acceptable Use Policy](https://bitly.com/pages/acceptable-use) and [Bitly’s DMCA Copyright Policy](https://bitly.com/pages/dmca-copyright-policy).

**YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY CREATING A BITLY ACCOUNT (“ACCOUNT”), PURCHASING A PAID ACCOUNT, OR ACCESSING OR USING THE BITLY SERVICES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACES (“API”), YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE BITLY ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE BITLY SERVICES.**

**THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 12.1 BELOW. YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**

**1\. SCOPE & MODIFICATIONS**

**1.1** **Modifications.** Bitly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If we modify this Agreement, we will post the modification on our site and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms of Use or provide you with notice of the modification in the Bitly platform. Any change to this Agreement will be effective as of the Last Updated Date in at the top of this page. By continuing to access or use the Bitly Services after the Last Updated Date, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. You agree that it is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes and that your use of the Bitly Services following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Bitly Services.

**1.2** **Service Changes.** Bitly may add, remove, suspend, discontinue, modify or update the Bitly Services at any time, at its discretion. After the effective date of such a change, Bitly shall bear no obligation to run, provide or support legacy versions of any affected Bitly Services.

**1.3** **Customer Support.** Bitly provides a help center for all users. More details about additional support services can be found in the help center which is accessible through the platform.

**1.4** **Destination Preview.** Certain tiers of Bitly Services may include “Destination Preview.” Destination Preview pages may be seen by someone who interacts with your link or QR Code prior to proceeding to the destination URL. Destination Preview will include information about the destination URL. Destination Preview pages may also include advertising as described in Bitly’s Privacy Policy. If an end user elects to interact with the advertising contained on the Destination Preview, such interaction is not governed by the Bitly Terms of Services, and is not part of the Bitly Services. Bitly makes no warranty, express or implied, related to the accuracy, quality or content related to the products, services or content included in any advertising. _If you wish to have an advertising free experience for your end users, you may purchase a fee-based Bitly Service that excludes advertising._

**2\. PAID ACCOUNTS**

**2.1** **Fees.** Bitly offers fee-based Bitly Services that provide additional features and functionality. If you sign up for a paid account, you agree to pay Bitly all applicable fees for the tier of Bitly Services according to your selection. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.

**2.2** **Subscription Period.** Paid account plans will be charged the rate stated at the time of initial purchase on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your subscription until you cancel. Fees are subject to change and Bitly will notify you of any pricing change prior to processing your next recurring charge. You may cancel your paid account subscription at any time, however, unless required by law, no refunds or credits will be provided for any early termination or for any non-use of the Bitly Services. Bitly reserves the right to update, change, modify or terminate your subscription benefits at any time in its sole discretion.

**2.3** **Payment.** You will pay Bitly on the payment interval selected. If not otherwise specified, payments will be due immediately. You authorize Bitly to charge you for all applicable fees on a recurring basis using your selected payment method through Bitly’s online payments platform. By providing a saved payment method (“Payment Method”) in your account, you expressly acknowledge and authorize Bitly (or our third party online payment processor) to charge you on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your subscription unless you cancel your paid account subscription. You are responsible for any and all fees charged to your Payment Method. You will provide complete and accurate billing and contact information to Bitly. Bitly may make changes to the offered Payment Method from time to time. It is your responsibility to update your payment information if necessary due to such changes. Bitly may suspend, downgrade or terminate the Services if Fees are past due. Unpaid Fees are subject to a finance charge of one percent (1.5%) per month (18% per annum), or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower. In addition, Bitly will be entitled to recover its expenses for collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Failure to pay Fees or Renewal Fees when due may lead to termination, cancellation or suspension of Services. **FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, BITLY MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES CORRESPONDING TO THE TERM OF YOUR SELECTED SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES OR NOTIFY BITLY THAT YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION.**

**2.4** **Taxes.** Fees are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (collectively, “Taxes”), and you are responsible for all Taxes resulting from this Agreement or your use of the Bitly Services. Bitly will invoice you for Taxes when required to do so by applicable law, and you agree to provide payment under the terms of the invoice. In the event you are required by law to deduct and withhold any Taxes on amounts payable under this Agreement, any amounts required to be withheld will be promptly deducted and timely remitted by you on behalf of Bitly to the appropriate taxation authority and you agree that you will provide Bitly with copies of all necessary documents (including but not limited to tax receipts received from the applicable tax authority) in order for Bitly to claim and receive a foreign tax credit in an amount corresponding to the amount withheld by you.

**3\. USE OF SERVICES**

**12\. GOVERNING LAW, VENUE & DISPUTES**

**12.1** **For US and non-EU Customers:**

**12.1.1** This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be governed by and construed under the Federal Arbitration Act and the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof and without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. To the extent any dispute between us is not subject to arbitration as set forth herein, the parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York for resolution of such dispute.

**12.1.2** **Limitation for Bringing Claims.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree that any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Bitly Services or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.

**12.1.3** **Arbitration of Disputes; Class Action Waiver.** All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) shall be finally resolved in arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. In an arbitration, an arbitrator decides any Disputes, and neither of us will have the right to bring a lawsuit in court or to have a judge or jury decide any Dispute. Each of us further agrees that any dispute over the scope of this arbitration provision, and any dispute as to whether a claim is subject to arbitration, shall be submitted to the arbitrator for decision.

If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, the venue for such hearing shall be (i) in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or, (ii) if you are an individual consumer, then at your option either in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you reside at the time the dispute is submitted to arbitration.

The foregoing notwithstanding, if you are an individual consumer then you and we both retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for any Dispute falling within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction.

In addition, we each agree that any Disputes will be adjudicated on an individual basis, and **each of us waives the right to participate in a class action, collective or other joint or consolidated action with respect to any Disputes**. This arbitration and class action waiver provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

**12.2** **For EU Customers:**

**12.2.1** This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be governed by and construed under the laws of Germany without regard to its conflict of laws provisions and to the exclusion of CISG.

**12.2.2** Except to the extent set out in the clause below, you and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the German courts in respect of any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement. In such cases, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of Berlin, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to the venue of such courts.

**12.2.3** **Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.** We each agree that any Disputes will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. All disputes arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC said Rules. The venue for such proceedings shall be in Berlin, Germany.

**12.2.4** The European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access at [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). We are not obliged and will not participate in an alternative dispute settlement procedure before a consumer dispute resolution entity.

**13\. MISCELLANEOUS**

**13.2** **Entire Agreement and Severability.** This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between the parties with respect thereto, including any non-disclosure agreements signed by the parties, and may be modified only by an express written agreement between the parties. Without limiting the foregoing, no additional or conflicting terms set out on any purchase order, invoice or similar document are binding.

**13.3** **Force Majeure.** Except for any Fees due hereunder, neither party shall not be liable for any delay in performing or failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such delay or failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, cyber-attacks, mechanical, electronic or communications failures, acts of God, terrorism, war, natural disasters, failure of any telecommunications or transportation or of any third party provider or supplier (e.g., host or app store providers) or labor disputes.

**13.4** **Assignment.** Except to an affiliate or in the event of a merger, acquisition or other change of control, neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written permission of the other party, and any attempt to do so is void. This Agreement shall be binding on any permitted successors and assigns.

**13.5** **Notices.** Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when sent, if transmitted by email; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.

**13.6** **Headings; Interpretation.** The section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Any use of “including” “for example” or “such as” in this Agreement shall be read as being followed by “without limitation.”

If you use the Bitly Services in its official capacity as an employee or representative of a U.S state or local government entity and are legally unable to accept the indemnity, jurisdiction, venue or other clauses herein, then those clauses do not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law.

**13.9** **General.** The failure of Bitly to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Bitly. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

**13.10** **Publicity.** You grant Bitly the right to use your name, trademarks and/or logos on its website, customer lists and/or in marketing, advertising or publicity materials to identify you as a customer that uses the Bitly Services.

**4\.** **PERSONNEL**

**6\.** **SECURITY AND AUDIT**

**6.1** **Controls for the Protection of Customer Data.** Bitly shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect the security (including against unauthorized or unlawful Processing of, and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Personal Information), confidentiality and integrity of Customer Personal Information; and Bitly shall monitor compliance with these measures in accordance with its internal information security program as set out in Bitly’s security documentation which is available upon written request. Customer agrees that the security measures set forth by Bitly provide an adequate level of protection for the Customer Personal Data processed under this DPA. If Customer deems that the security measures are insufficient to provide adequate protection, Customer shall inform Bitly in writing and the parties agree to work together to resolve such matter(s).

**6.2** **Audit and Reports.** Upon Customer’s written request Bitly shall make available to Customer all reasonably required information, certificates, documents and reports to demonstrate Bitly’s and Bitly Affiliate’s compliance with this DPA.

**7\.** **CUSTOMER DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION**

Bitly maintains security incident management policies and procedures and shall notify Customer without undue delay and in line with the timelines required by applicable Data Protection Laws after becoming aware of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Personal Information that is transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed by Bitly or its Subprocessors which results in any actual loss or unauthorized use of Customer Personal Information (a “**Data Security Incident**”). Bitly shall make reasonable efforts to identify the cause of such Data Security Incident and take those steps as Bitly deems reasonably necessary in order to remediate the cause of any such Data Security Incident to the extent the remediation is within Bitly’s reasonable control. Bitly shall have no liability for costs arising from a Data Security Incident unless caused by Bitly’s violation of Data Protection Laws for which Bitly is legally responsible. In the event of a Data Security Incident, Customer shall be responsible for notifying Data Subjects and/or Supervisory Authorities. Before any such notification is made, Customer shall consult with and provide Bitly an opportunity to comment on any notification made in connection with a Customer Data Incident. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not restrict Customer’s ability to comply with its legal obligations, if Bitly does not comment on such notification in a timely manner. Upon Customer’s written request and if required to deal or comply with any assessment, enquiry, notice or investigation by the Supervisory Authority Bitly will provide commercially reasonable assistance to Customer at Customer’s expense.

**8\.** **RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA**

Bitly shall, on the written request of Customer, return all Customer Personal Information to Customer and/or at Customer’s request delete the same from its systems, other than any back-up copies which Bitly or its Affiliates are required to retain for compliance with applicable laws or regulatory requirements provided that such copies are kept confidential and secure in accordance with this Agreement.
