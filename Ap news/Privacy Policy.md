**5\. Cookies Policy: How Do the Services Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We, and/or our service providers or partners on our behalf, may use tracking technologies, which may run on your device and/or browser when you use the Services. These technologies enable us to assign a unique number to your computer or device and to relate information about your use of the Services and other information about you, including Personal Information. These technologies also enable us to recognize you when you access our Services using different web browsers or devices.  
  
**_Types of Tracking Technologies:_** These tracking technologies may include:  

* **Cookies.** These are small pieces of text that are provided by most web sites and stored by your web browser on the computer, phone, or other device that you are using. Cookies serve many purposes, such as helping a web site remember your preferences, learning which areas of a web site are useful and which areas need improvement, and providing you with targeted advertisements or personalized content. Sometimes, cookies are enabled when pixels (see below) are placed on a web site. Cookies can be first-party or third-party. A first-party cookie is one that you receive directly from The Associated Press when visiting our Services. A third-party cookie is one that you receive from another party. Please note, we do not control what third parties do on other web sites. We may work with certain third-party providers to permit their cookies to function through our Services so we can learn more about your web experience on our Services and better personalize our Services for you.
* **Pixels.** Also called web beacons, clear GIFs, and tags, pixels are one-pixel transparent images that are located on web pages or messages. Pixels track whether you have opened web pages or messages. They enable web sites to read and place cookies.
* **Software Development Kits (SDKs).** SDKs are pieces of code provided by our digital vendors (such as third-party advertising companies, ad networks, and analytics providers) that may be in our mobile app to collect and analyze certain device and user data.
* **JavaScript.** This is a programming language that can be used to write trackers that, when embedded into a page, allow us to measure how you interact with our web site and other web sites.
* **Device Identifiers.** These are identifiers that are stored directly on a device and are unique to that specific device.

**_How We May Use Tracking Technologies:_** Circumstances in which we may deploy tracking technologies include:  

* We may use cookies or local shared objects, such as “Flash cookies.” Cookies are small packets of data that a web site stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive (or other storage medium) so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We use both first- and third-party session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Services; a session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time or until you delete them. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your web browser’s “help” file. To the extent we provide a log-in portal or related feature on our Services, persistent cookies can be used to store your passwords so that you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to personalize the experience on our Services. Similar to many other web sites, if you have enabled cookies in your browser, we, independently and through enabled third-party tools and programs, may collect certain technical information using cookies, such as originating IP address, browser type, browser language, how a user got to the Service (i.e., the URL of the last web site you visited), the next web site the user visits, what pages are visited, the length of each site visit, and the date and time of the user’s visit. This information helps us track trends and improve user experiences when using the Services.
* HTML5 may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Service usage activities. This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Services are being used by our visitors, how our Services may be improved, and to customize our Services for our users.
* We may send instructions to your computer or device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Service.
* We use Meta Pixel and Google Pixel to understand how our web site, services, and products perform, how you use them, and to serve you with ads on third-party web sites and social networking sites. These pixels may collect certain limited information such as your IP address, browser/device type, and the pages you visit on our Services. This data is stored and processed by Meta and Google, as applicable. For information about how Meta may use this data, please visit Meta’s Privacy Policy at [https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/). For information about how Google may use this data, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

**_How You Can Manage Tracking Technologies:_**   
  

* A cookie banner will be displayed to users of our Services who are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”), which will invite users to give their consent, where applicable, and will provide further options for the management of tracking technologies.

You can access Your Privacy Choices by going to our web site’s navigation menu (the three-line menu in the upper left corner of our web site), then scrolling down to and clicking on “Your Privacy Choices.”

The Services may allow you to share Personal Information with us that you have already provided to a third-party social networking platform. For example, you may be able to create an account on the Services or log in to the Services using your Facebook account or other third-party credentials. If you do so, Personal Information or other data that you have provided to the third party may be made available to us by that third party subject to its own privacy policy, terms, and conditions. Privacy policies of social networks and other external platforms explain how those third parties use, protect, and share your information, including any information you share on those platforms from the Services, and we encourage you to read these privacy policies. The information we receive from these platforms may depend on your privacy settings.  
  
We may also include tools in the Services that allow you to share or publicly post content from the Services to your profile on a third-party social network. You may choose to share information about your activities on the Services with such third-party platforms and their users, including publishing your information about what content you may have viewed on the Services. If you visit the Services while logged into certain social media platforms, the social media platform may be able to identify your browser and associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that they have already collected about you, which may result in their ability to identify you. In addition, when you choose to share information about your activities on the Services with certain social media platforms, AP may send technical information about you to that platform as well as information about what content you are viewing.  
  
**_Third-Party Web Sites and Content._** The Services may allow access to third-party content and services, such as via links, banners, widgets, or advertisements that lead to third-party web sites (“Third-Party Web Sites”).

California’s Shine the Light Law: Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to obtain certain information about the types of Personal Information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship (and that are not otherwise exempt) have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, including the names and addresses of those third parties, and examples of the types of services or products marketed by those third parties. If you wish to submit a request pursuant to Section 1798.83, go [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9efcd77d-fbf7-40b0-a4b6-8fe108d3d374/766ad301-0e47-4688-b35c-08a0bd369481).  
  
**_B. US Residents_**  
Residents of certain US States have state-law rights regarding use of their Personal Information. While some of these laws may not apply to not-for-profit organizations, we permit residents of these states to exercise similar control over their Personal Information. If you are a resident of a US state that does not currently have applicable laws in effect, you may not be able to make these privacy choices at this time, but your ability to do so may change as data privacy laws change.  
  
  
**Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information and Sharing/Processing for Targeted Ads. _For California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Utah, and Virginia Residents Only._**  
  
**Tracking Technologies.**  
To opt out of the sale or sharing/processing of your Personal Information for targeted ads for the site/app on your browser/device via tracking technologies, go to “Your Privacy Choices” on our web site, which you can access by going to the navigation menu (upper left corner of our web site), then scrolling down to and clicking on “Your Privacy Choices.” When opt-out preference signals are detected, they will be honored. As you make your privacy choices, please keep in mind the following:  

* If you decide not to allow the sale of Personal Information or sharing/processing of Personal Information for targeted ads, you will continue to see ads, but they may be less relevant or based only on information that we collect directly from your use of the Services.
* Choices related to tracking technologies (including cookies and device identifiers) are specific to the site/app on the browser/device where you are making the selection, meaning that you must make Your Privacy Choices selections on each site/app on each browser/device you use to access our web site.
* You must renew your selections for Your Privacy Choices each time you clear your cookies.

**Name, Email, and Associated Personal Information (“Do Not Sell or Share/Process My Personal Information for Targeted Ads”).** We do not sell your Personal Information in exchange for monetary consideration. Our use of certain technologies described in this Privacy Policy may be interpreted as sharing your Personal Information for targeted advertising. You can opt out of the use of your name, email, and other associated Personal Information for targeted advertising activities by completing and submitting our [Do Not Sell or Share/Process My Personal Info Form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9efcd77d-fbf7-40b0-a4b6-8fe108d3d374/766ad301-0e47-4688-b35c-08a0bd369481).  
  
**Access, Correct, or Delete Personal Information. _For California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Utah, and Virginia Residents Only._**  
Residents of states with relevant laws may make the following requests regarding use of Personal Information:  

* **Request to Access Information.** You may request that we confirm whether we are collecting or processing your Personal Information. Depending on relevant law, you may ask us to provide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible
* **Request to Delete Information**. You may request that we delete your Personal Information that we have collected from you. We will honor your request to the extent we are able to, but please not that we may have reason to deny or limit your request, such as a legal obligation to retain information or to provide goods or services that you have requested.
* **Request to Correct Personal Information**. You may request that we maintain accurate Personal Information about you and correct any inaccuracies in your Personal Information that we have collected from you, subject to exceptions within the law.
* **Request to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information**. California law permits residents to limit the use or disclosure of their “Sensitive Personal Information” as defined under relevant law. We generally do not collect or process Sensitive Personal Information. In the event we do process Sensitive Personal Information, we will not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes as allowed under relevant law.

To make a request to access, correct, or delete your Personal Information, you may make this request [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9efcd77d-fbf7-40b0-a4b6-8fe108d3d374/32b3f960-c18a-4dad-96b3-28213a220bd8).  
  
**_Authorized Agent_.** Depending on relevant law, you may authorize another person (your “agent”) to submit a request on your behalf.  
  
**_Processing Requests._** Once you submit your request, we will contact you with instructions for how to verify the request.

Please note that it may take additional time to verify and fulfill agent-submitted requests. Also note that many of the above requests are subject to exceptions and limitations.

Residents of some countries outside the US, such as the EEA and the UK, have the rights, in certain circumstances, to: (i) require us to delete your Personal Information, (ii) require us to restrict processing of your Personal Information (also referred to as Personal Data) (for example, if you contest the accuracy of that information), (iii) receive a copy of the Personal Information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or instruct us to transmit that data to a third party, and (iv) object to our continued processing of your Personal Information, for direct marketing (including profiling) or other purposes. If you reside in one of these countries, you can exercise these rights [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9efcd77d-fbf7-40b0-a4b6-8fe108d3d374/32b3f960-c18a-4dad-96b3-28213a220bd8).  
  
You may object to Personal Information processed pursuant to our legitimate interest (see Section 10 for information about our legitimate interest as a legal basis). In such case, we will no longer process your Personal Information unless we can demonstrate appropriate, overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or if needed for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. You may also object at any time to processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. You may make these objections [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/9efcd77d-fbf7-40b0-a4b6-8fe108d3d374/32b3f960-c18a-4dad-96b3-28213a220bd8).

**10\. What Is Our Legal Basis for Use of Your Personal Information?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The laws of some jurisdictions, such as the EEA and the UK, require us to tell you about the legal basis for using, sharing, or disclosing your Personal Information. To the extent those laws apply, we may rely on the following legal bases:

* **Contract** \- The performance of a contract we have with you.  
    
* **Legal Obligation** \- The compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.  
    
* **Legitimate Interest** – Where use of your Personal Information is necessary for our or third parties’ legitimate interests and where the use is not outweighed by your rights and interests. Legitimate interests include: providing the Services; improving the Services and developing new ones; recognizing and better understanding our users; conducting security and fraud-prevention activities; marketing and promoting our content and Services; conducting compliance and risk-management activities; ensuring the network and information security of our systems.

We do not knowingly collect personal information of individuals under the age of 18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 18, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided personal information to us, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://apnews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
