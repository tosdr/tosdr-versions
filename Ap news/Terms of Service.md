**16\. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**
----------------------------------------------------

Please read the following arbitration agreement (the “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with us and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, including a class action waiver.  
  
You agree that, in the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, related to, in connection with, or resulting in any way from your use of the Services, these Terms of Use, the Content, or any aspect of your relationship with us (each, a “Dispute”), such Dispute, including threshold questions of the arbitrability of such Dispute, will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY SUCH SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. DISCOVERY, AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will prevent AP from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect AP’s proprietary interests and intellectual property rights.  
  
You and we both agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve Disputes prior to either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement. You must initiate this dispute resolution process by sending a letter describing the nature of your claim and desired resolution to the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us section of these Terms of Use (see Section 20). You and we agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (“Conference”) to discuss the Dispute and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while you and we engage in the informal dispute resolution process and Conference required by this Section14.3. If you and we do not reach agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either you or we may commence arbitration or, provided such claims qualify, file an action in small claims court or file a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual property infringement.  
  
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent at to the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us Section of these Terms of Use (see Section 20). The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. JAMS’s rules are available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, we will pay them for you if you complied with the dispute resolution process set forth above. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process set forth above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in the United States), or at another mutually agreed upon location that is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  
  
The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.  
  
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any Dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  
  
YOU AND WE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section14.2. An arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms of Use as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  
  
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party’s claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and we agree that no Dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.  
  
If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  
  
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.  
  
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we make any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to us at the address provided for Legal Matters in the Contact Us Section of these Terms of Use (see Section 20).
