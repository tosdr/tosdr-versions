(e) Euractiv is in the process of prioritising first-party data over third-party data in order to provide a better user experience to its readers. This may lead to being requested to 'register an account' or 'sign in'. Details that you provide to Euractiv will be held and used in accordance with Euractiv's [privacy policy.](https://www.euractiv.com/privacy/)

Any other use is subject to syndication and is allowed only with prior approval of Euractiv and may be subject to a fee. For details in this sense please contact: digital(@)euractiv.com.

**4\. Community Guidelines**

(a) Euractiv's online Code of Conduct is composed of a handful of clear and easily graspable rules.

1. **Dialogue, not monologue:** If you engage in a debate, please make sure that your line of argumentation is clear, specific, well–founded and grammatically correct. Avoid drifting away from the topic do not forget to link your statement to the context of the initial discussion. Please do not over-speculate and instead come up with a coherent argumentation based on evidence.
2. **No venue for online hate speech**: Any forms of propaganda, threat, inflammatory comments, personal insults or defamatory and discriminating remarks are not tolerated anywhere on Euractiv. You must also exercise prudence when it comes to irony and sarcasm in online communication in order to minimise the scope for misinterpretations. “Do as you would be done by” – recall this rule before you press the “send” button. Ask yourself whether you would have chosen the same wording in a real-life conversation – if not, rephrase your message along the lines of this codex. In case you detect hate speech coming from fellow users, report these comments straight away and avoid engaging with the author. Help the [Euractiv team](http://www.euractiv.com/contactus/) to ensure a good atmosphere on its channels.
3. **The Internet is not a “lawless” space**: Check whether you are entitled to share a post, post a link or publish content before doing so. Copyright, intellectual property rights, the right to the protection of one’s image and appropriate marking of quotations – none of these loose validity online. Moreover, followers should not use fake accounts to engage in debates – Euractiv aims to strengthen transparent discussions and seeks to limit any form of bias and distortion.
4. **Euractiv is not a free advertising platform**: Euractiv has set up several online accounts to foster a trans-European dialogue. Non-official advertisements and spam of all sorts hinder coherent conversations and are therefore removed from Euractiv pages.

(b) Repercussions

1. **Deletion**: If the editorial team detects a statement which falls into the category of hate speech, Euractiv will delete it.
2. **Blocking**: If a person repeatedly violates our online code of conduct, their profile will be denied access to comment in future.

(c) If you see comments that you believe ought not to be published, please contact digital@euractiv.com.

**5\. Third Party Content and Websites**

(a) Some contents (including links, letters to the editor, blog posts and comments to articles) of the website are supplied by a third party and may lead to other websites, including those operated and maintained by third parties (‘Third Party Content’).

(b) Euractiv includes Third Party Content solely as a convenience to its users, and the presence of such contents does not imply Euractiv's responsibility for them, for the linked website or an endorsement of the contents or the linked website or its operator.

(c) The Third Party Content must be civil and tasteful. It must not be disruptive or offensive. It must not contain unlawful content, inappropriate usernames (e.g. vulgar, offensive etc.) or off-topic material.

(d) Advertising in Third Party Content is not allowed unless prior written approval of Euractiv has been given.

(e) By sharing any Third Party Content (including any text, photograph, graphics or video) with Euractiv you grant to Euractiv, free of charge, permission to use the material in any way it wants (including modifying and adapting it for operational and editorial reasons) for Euractiv services. In certain circumstance Euractiv can share your contribution with third parties.

(g) Address Third Party Content to the editor at [editor@euractiv.com](mailto:editor@euractiv.com).

Intelligence Terms & Conditions
-------------------------------

1. **Access to and use of the platform and user obligations**
    1. Euractiv points out that it strives for an uninterrupted usability and accessibility of the Platform. However, temporary restrictions or interruptions may occur, especially due to technical faults (e.g. interruption of the power supply, hardware and software faults and technical problems in the data lines).
    2. The Authorised User has the following obligations:
    3. The Authorised User must keep the access credentials confidential and may not communicate or disclose its access credentials to third parties (including without limitation other individuals within its organisation, company or legal entity) and has to protect its access credentials against intentional or accidental notice by third parties.
    4. The Authorised User is obliged to inform Euractiv  immediately if the Authorised User has reason to assume that third parties have become aware of its access credentials or has indications of any form of unauthorised use of access credentials; the Authorised User shall be liable for any unauthorised use of its access credentials by third parties unless the Authorised User can prove that such unauthorised use was not caused by actual fault of the Authorised User.
    5. The Authorised User is not allowed to provide access to the Platform to third parties or to rent, lease, lend, trade, sell, resell or otherwise monetise the access to the Platform; Euractiv shall not be liable for any damages for such use of the Platform by third parties;
    6. The Authorised User must refrain from any form of unauthorised use of the Platform, including but not limited to attempts made to overcome or circumvent the security mechanisms of the Platform or to otherwise incapacitate them, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Platform or any related technology that is not open source, using computer programs enabling automatic data readouts as for example crawlers or bots, as well as using and/or circulating viruses, worms, trojans or other malware, brute force attacks, spam or using other links, programmes or procedures that are suited to damage Euractiv, the Platform and/or other Authorised Users.
    7. The Authorised User may not use the Platform or any Platform Content to commit or promote or to help to commit or to promote:
        1. (a) physical or non-physical violence or criminal behaviour, including terrorist activity, mass or serial murder and human trafficking;

    8. The Authorised User has to take all necessary and reasonable steps to prevent or limit damage caused using the Platform or any Platform Content, in particular to:
        1. (a) arrange for the regular backup of its own data outside of the Platform;
        2. (b) diligently check the information provided via the Platform (including without limitation the results of calculations or computations provided via Platform applications) or have such information checked and cleared by an expert, particularly with regard to compliance with applicable norms and permits, prior to using them for own purposes, as the information provided via the Platform only serves as an aid for evaluation, interpretation and assessment by the Authorised User.
    9. The Authorised User has to avoid giving the impression that he or she is affiliated with or endorsed by Euractiv if that is not the case.
    10. The Authorised User may not operate a service which frames, mirrors or otherwise simulates the appearance or functioning of the Platform.
    11. The Authorised User must keep the data provided to Euractiv up to date, especially regarding the data provided with the registration (including contact details).
    12. Euractiv reserves the right to temporarily limit an Authorised User's access to the Platform or certain parts of the Platform if and as long as it has substantive indications of fraud or misuse of the Platform in connection with the access credentials of an Authorised User. Euractiv will accordingly inform the Authorised User without undue delay regarding such limitation. Euractiv will remove any such limitation or issue new access credentials once it can exclude negative impacts on the Authorised User, Euractiv, the Platform or third parties.
2. **Intellectual property rights** 
    1. The Platform and the Platform Content may be protected under copyright law and other statutory provisions. Euractiv reserves all intellectual property rights to the Platform. Use of the Platform does not mean that the Authorised User has any ownership rights with respect to the Platform or the Platform Content made available through the Platform. The trademarks and logos used in connection with the Platform are trademarks of their respective owners.
    2. Euractiv grants to the Authorised User for the duration of the registration the revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Platform for its own purposes, provided that this use complies with the provisions of these General Terms and applicable special terms as well as with applicable statutory provisions. Authorised Users will not be granted any further rights of use. In particular, Authorised Users are not entitled to allow third parties to access the Platform, nor may they modify or otherwise process the Platform and Platform Content, incorporate it into another work, or use it to create databases and/or information services of their own, unless a corresponding functionality is explicitly provided for this purpose within the Platform.
3. **Liability and limitation of liability**
    1. Euractiv shall be held liable only under the following circumstances, regardless of the legal grounds:
        1. If one of its legal representatives or executives or other vicarious agents has acted intentionally or grossly negligently;
        2. In the event of slight negligence, each party undertakes liability only in case of the breach of an essential contractual duty. The expression "essential contractual duty" describes a duty in the abstract, the fulfilment of which is an essential pre-requisite for the due implementation of Euractiv's obligations, and that is a duty on whose fulfilment the respective other party can rely as a general rule.
    2. In the event of liability pursuant to Clause 9.1.2, this shall be limited for financial losses and damages to property to the amount of the typically foreseeable loss.
4. **Modifications of term of use**
    1. Euractiv reserves the right to amend provisions of these General Terms and applicable special terms that are minor in scope or nature if deemed necessary, especially in case of changes in law and jurisdiction and provided that the user is not disadvantaged thereby against good faith. Euractiv will communicate, by e-mail or within the Platform, the modified conditions at least two weeks prior to the effective date. Users who do not object in text form (letter, e-mail, fax) to the modification within four weeks after the receipt of the e-mail or their notice of corresponding Euractiv communication within the Platform will be deemed to have accepted the respective modification. Euractiv will specifically indicate the possibility of objecting to the modification and the consequences of above deadline.
    2. If the user objects to the new (modified) General Terms or applicable special terms, Euractiv's request to modify them to this extent will be deemed to have been rejected. The agreement will then be continued without the proposed modification. Euractiv's right to withdraw the registration or Service or the user's right to terminate the registration or Service remains unaffected.

5. **Data protection**
    1. The Authorised User must process any personal data in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions, especially but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    2. For information on how Euractiv processes personal data please see the [Privacy Policy](http://intelligence.euractiv.com/privacy/).

6. **Miscellaneous**
    1. The use of the Platform and the Platform Content requires the use of special technical systems such as end user devices, software programs, transmission networks, telecommunications and other services provided by third parties, all of which may entail further costs. Euractiv does not provide such end user devices, software programmes, communication channels, telecommunications services or other services and therefore will not assume any liability for such services provided by third parties.
    2. Any addition or amendment of these General Terms or applicable special terms as well as individual agreements deviating from these General Terms must be in written form (on paper and signed) to be valid. This shall also apply to any waiver of this written form requirement.
    3. The rights and duties under the Authorised User's registration may only be transferred with the prior written consent of Euractiv.
    4. The registration does not authorise either of the parties to make any legally binding declarations on behalf of both parties together, or on behalf of the respective other party, nor does it authorise them to place the respective other party under any obligation or to represent it in any other way.
    5. Should any individual provision of these General Terms or applicable special terms be of no effect, as a whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The invalid provision will be deemed replaced by that provision that is legally effective and comes closest, in the usual understanding, to the economic intent and purpose of the invalid provision. The same applies to any unintentional omission.

7. **Governing law, jurisdiction and online dispute resolution**
    1. The General Terms are governed by the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The application of the Convention on Contracts of the International Sale of Goods 1980 and the conflict of law rules are excluded. The legal regulations for the restriction of the choice of law and for the applicability of compelling regulations in particular of the country, in which the user as a consumer has its usual stay, remain unaffected.
    2. If the user is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes in connection with these General Terms and their validity is Hamburg, Germany.
    3. The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR) with consumers which can be found on the European Commission platform: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr) . Policy Insider (contact@policy-insider.ai) is not obliged or willing to participate in this or another dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration body.

    5.

    6. Some of the data may be protected by copyright law and may be copyright of Euractiv or third parties.
