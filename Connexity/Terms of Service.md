Search results and certain other links on the Connexity Network contain links to Merchant web sites. For purposes of these Terms, the "Connexity Network" means [www.connexity.com](http://www.connexity.com/), [www.shopzilla.com](http://www.shopzilla.com/), www.bizrate.com, www.beso.com, and other affiliated domains in the United States, and all other web sites we operate now or may operate in the future, and other media or services we may offer to consumers from time to time.

Sponsored Shopping Content

6.1

Subject to your continued compliance with the Terms (including the Eligibility Requirements noted above), you may present the Connexity and/or third party advertisements, content, creative materials, search queries or results that we provide you ("Sponsored Shopping Content") only on those Sites you have enrolled in the Program and that are approved by us in our sole discretion, where such Sponsored Shopping Content links to Merchants in the Connexity Network as determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, placing Sponsored Shopping Content on any Site that was not approved by us (pursuant to Section 3) is strictly prohibited and you are not entitled to payment for any traffic from such unauthorized Sites. If requested by Connexity, you agree that you will present the Sponsored Shopping Content to users of your Site in a form and manner and using creative elements as specified by Connexity from time to time. In addition, if you are permitted access to Shopping Content Technology (as defined in Schedule 1), you will use the Shopping Content Technology in accordance with Schedule 1 hereto. You will direct the Sponsored Shopping Content to the location(s) indicated to you by Connexity and provide linked attribution to the applicable Connexity Network website as the source of the Sponsored Shopping Content on each page of your Site displaying the Sponsored Shopping Content.

You agree the Sponsored Shopping Content and related logo(s), creative materials, programming, Javascript, Analytics Code (as defined below) and other information or materials provided by or on behalf of Connexity ("Connexity Materials") shall not be altered, modified, circumvented, impaired, disabled or otherwise interfered with by you.

7.2

Upon and throughout your participation in the Program, you will post and maintain a clear and conspicuous privacy policy on your Site that: (a) complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and self-regulatory industry standards, including the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as published by the Digital Advertising Alliance; (b) accurately informs visitors to your Site of your data collection practices, including but not limited to the collection of Analytics Data by third parties; and (c) includes all of the minimum privacy terms as set forth in Schedule 2 hereto ("Minimum Terms"), which may be updated by us from time to time in our sole discretion. For avoidance of doubt, where your Site requires a download, you will (i) post such privacy policy on your website and any online marketplace or app store where such Site is made available for download; and (ii) make such privacy policy available to users at the time they seek to download the Site. You agree that you will include the Minimum Terms in your privacy policy exactly as written and without modification, or if modified by you, then you do so at your own risk. Unless you use the Sample Policy described below, there are no exceptions to the above requirement to include the Minimum Terms. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any failure to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.2.

7.3

For your convenience, a sample privacy policy that contains the Minimum Terms is set forth in the attached Schedule 3 ("Sample Policy"). You may use this Sample Policy on your Site, provided you modify it, as needed, to accurately reflect the data collection practices on your Site, while ensuring compliance with Section 7.2 above. You understand and acknowledge that the Sample Policy is not suitable for use on sites operating outside the US and is provided solely for your convenience and illustration purposes. Connexity does not warrant that the Sample Policy is fit for your Site or that it will remain suitable and in compliance with these Terms, or the laws as they evolve, including without limitation the laws, regulations, or industry guidelines that may apply to you or your Site. For avoidance of doubt, your use of the Sample Policy does not relieve you of your obligations set forth in this Section 7. Any use of the Sample Policy by you is at your sole risk.

7.4

In addition to the foregoing, you agree that on each page within your Site that displays Sponsored Shopping Content, you will provide clear, meaningful, and prominent links that will take your visitors directly to (a) the Minimum Terms within your privacy policy, and (b) to the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page, currently located at www.aboutads.info/choices.

8.

Your Information

You grant to Connexity and our parent company, subsidiaries, and affiliates ("Affiliates"), the right to transmit, process and maintain the personal and business information that you provide to Connexity via the Program, to use such information for Connexity's and its Affiliates business purposes, and share such information with selected third parties, including but not limited to Connexity's agents, accountants, attorneys and other representatives for Connexity's and its Affiliates' business purposes.

9.

Payment and Reporting

You agree as follows:

9.1

For each month or portion thereof in which you participate in the Program, Connexity will make a payment to you based upon the Net Revenue received by Connexity from valid users clicks on links containing the Sponsored Shopping Content on your Site in such period, as determined by Connexity's standard tracking method ("Payment"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that your ability to earn Payments under this Program are expressly conditioned upon your satisfaction and continued compliance with the Eligibility Requirements set forth above, including providing and maintaining accurate payment information. If at any time during the Term (as defined in Section 16 below), you fail to satisfy the Eligibility Requirements, any amounts otherwise payable to you during the period of such failure will be deemed unearned and will not accrue to your Account due to your ineligibility for participation in this Program. "Net Revenue" shall mean revenue less an administrative fee no more than five (5) percent to cover collections, serving and administrative costs, among others. We will grant you access to an online reporting tool to view traffic activity and estimated Payments generated by Sponsored Shopping Content from your Site during the Term. "Account" shall mean your publisher account for this Program. You understand and agree that Connexity shall have the right in its sole discretion to credit, adjust or discount charges to Merchants based on its determination of quality of traffic or source (e.g., non-US) generated via the Sponsored Shopping Content and to offset future Payments to you based on such credits or adjustments to Merchants for traffic generated by your Site. You further agree that Connexity shall have no obligation to issue any Payment(s) to you if Connexity has not received remittance from the relevant Merchant(s) of all monies due to Connexity. In the event of such non-payments or bad debts, Connexity reserves the right to offset future Payments to you or invoice you for such amount owed in its sole discretion. Your recourse for any such adjustment due to non-payment shall be to make a claim against the relevant Merchant(s), and Connexity disclaims any and all liability for such Payments.

9.2

Subject to these Terms, including, without limitation, your satisfaction of and continued compliance with all Eligibility Requirements, Connexity will issue the Payment for the previous month's activity forty-five (45) days after the last day of that month, subject to a minimum Payment of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), or such other minimum payment as Connexity may establish ("Minimum Payment"). Account balances of less than the Minimum Payment will remain in your Account until a balance of the Minimum Payment is met. Connexity will make one or more methods, by which to receive Payments, available to you, in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Payment(s) that is less than a certain monetary threshold as determined by Connexity, in its sole discretion, Connexity reserves the right (but has no obligation) to issue such Payment(s) to you via PayPal to the email address on file in your Account. All Payments under these Terms will be made in U.S. Dollars. We reserve the right to assess a charge on your Account of ten dollars ($10.00) for each attempted issuance of a Payment to you which is returned or undeliverable.

9.3

We reserve the right to suspend, withhold or adjust any Payment to you in the event of any suspected or actual violation of these Terms or part thereof, or other policy or guideline established by Connexity in connection with the Program (including, but not limited to reviews of merchant credit requests), and in particular we reserve the right to suspend, withhold or adjust any Payment based on any amounts which result from clicks generated by any person, robot, automated program or similar device in violation of the Terms, as reasonably determined by Connexity, including without limitation any valid clicks co-mingled with invalid clicks. You agree to forfeit and/or have offset any payments made which are determined by Connexity (in our sole absolute discretion) to have been generated by you or from your Site in violation of these Terms or other policy or guideline established by Connexity in connection with the Program.

9.4

You agree to pay all applicable taxes, including any applicable value added tax (VAT) or other similar taxes, imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Program. You are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information in connection with your participation in the Program. U.S. taxpayers must provide, among other information, a valid U.S. tax identification number and a fully-completed Form W-9. Non-U.S. taxpayers must provide either a fully-completed Form W-8 or other form, which may require a valid U.S. tax identification number, and signed certification that the taxpayer does not have U.S. activities as required by the U.S. tax authorities.

9.5

Any questions or claims by you regarding any charges or payments must be raised with us in writing within sixty (60) days after the date such charges are accrued or payments issued, or else the charges or payments will be deemed final and will not be subject to any further claims or disputes. No refunds, credits or other billing adjustments will be made if a question or dispute is not asserted by you in writing within sixty (60) days of the date on which the applicable charges are accrued or payments issued. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Connexity.

10.

Program Management

We may, for any period of time, suspend the Program, the use of any or all Connexity Property (including any Shopping Content Technology), or your Account, in whole or in part, to: (a) undertake any routine or emergency maintenance to the Program, the Shopping Content Technology or the Connexity Network; (b) to maintain the security and/or integrity of our network, hardware, other technology or associated systems or those of our suppliers; (c) any unusual increases in traffic or quality of traffic on your Site; or (d) the actual or alleged violation of the Terms by you. We reserve the right, in our sole absolute discretion, to change all or any part of these Terms and/or other policies or guidelines related to the Program, including but not limited to prohibiting certain Site content, changing the basis of compensation and/or changing the payment schedule. We further reserve the right to change or discontinue the Program altogether. We may make these changes at any time, by posting such changes to the Program portion of our web site.

Your continued participation in the Program will constitute your acceptance of the then-current Terms.

Introduction

Maintaining your privacy is one of our highest priorities. Accordingly, we have created this privacy policy ("Policy") to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as it relates to your use of our website and services (the "website").

2.

Information we Collect

We collect two types of information from users through our website: personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-personally identifiable information ("non-PII").

PII identifies you individually. We may collect PII such as: (a) your contact information (e.g., your name, email address, physical address, or phone number) that you may provide to us in filling out forms or when you enter into a contest or promotion on our website; or (b) photographs or other information about yourself that you may upload or post to our website through comments or otherwise, including information on your gender, sexual orientation, marital status, religious views, age, occupation, or other similar information.

Non-PII does not identify you as an individual. We may collect non-PII such as: (a) certain non-personal data when you visit our website, such as the type of operating system or browser you are using, the URL of sites from which you arrive or leave our website and how you interact with our website, your internet service provider, your mobile carrier; or (b) user information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes.

3.

Your Consent

We will collect, use, or disclose your PII only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, or as compelled by a court of law or other government body of competent authority. When you choose to provide us with your PII you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Policy (i.e., in connection with your use of our website and services) and as may be further identified at the time of collection. You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information. We will accommodate your request subject to any legal and contractual restrictions.
