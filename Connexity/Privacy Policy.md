**Your Rights**

Where you are located in the European Union, in certain circumstances you are entitled to the following rights with respect to your personal data:

**(a) Right to object to processing based on our legitimate interests:** You have the right to object to us processing your personal data on the grounds of it being in our legitimate interests.

**(b) Right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications:** You have the right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us.

**(c) Right to access, delete and correct your personal data:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, to delete and/or correct it.

**(d) Right to be forgotten:** In certain circumstances you can ask for the personal data we hold about you to be erased from our records.

**(e) Right to restriction of processing:** Where certain conditions apply to have a right to restrict the processing of your personal data.

If you think you are entitled to exercise any of the above rights and would like to do so, please contact us by [clicking here.](https://www.connexity.com/your-rights/)

**Privacy Shield**

Connexity participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Connexity is committed to subjecting all personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, to the principles underlying the Privacy Shield (the “Principles”). To learn more about the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program, and to view Connexity’s certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce site at https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

**Accountability for Onward Transfer**

If we transfer personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, to a third party acting as a controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to data subjects and any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given us contractual assurances that it will (i) process the personal data for limited and specific purposes consistent with any consent provided by the data subjects; (ii) provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles and notify us if it makes a determination it cannot do so; and (iii) cease processing of the personal data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If Connexity has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is processing such personal data in a way that is contrary to the Principles, Connexity will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.

With respect to our third-party agents, we will transfer only the personal data needed for an agent to deliver to Connexity the requested product or service. Furthermore, we will (i) permit the agent to process such personal data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) require the agent to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the personal data transferred in a manner consistent with Connexity’s obligations under the Principles; and (iv) require the agent to notify Connexity if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles. Upon receiving notice from an agent that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.

Connexity remains liable under the Principles if an agent processes personal data received from EU member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield, in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where Connexity is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**Complaints**

If you are located in the European Union, in the event that you wish to make a complaint about how your personal data is being processed by us or that we have not taken any action requested by you in relation to your rights set out above, you have the right to lodge a complaint directly with our EU supervisory authority and our data protection representative. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us in the first instance.
