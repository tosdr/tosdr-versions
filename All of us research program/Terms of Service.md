By choosing to participate in _All of Us_ Research Program (RP) or by using any _All of Us_ RP Services, you are agreeing to the terms below.

Using _All of Us_ Research Program Services
===========================================

The Services contain documents that talk about _All of Us_ policies, and these documents are available for you to read. You must follow these policies.

Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law. If you do not follow our terms or policies, or if we are investigating possible misuse of our Services, we may temporarily or permanently stop providing our Services to you.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights to our Services or the information and materials you access. You may not use information or materials from our Services unless the owner gives you permission or if the law allows you to use them. You may not use any branding or logos used in our Services unless you are given permission. Don't remove, hide, or change any legal information or notices shown inside or with our Services.

We may send you announcements and other messages about your use of _All of Us_ Services, either during recruitment processes or enrollment. You may choose not to receive those communications.

Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use these Services in a way that distracts you or prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, do not use these Services while operating a car.

Your _All of Us_ Account
========================

To protect your _All of Us_ RP account, keep your password private. If you find out about someone using your account without your permission, please contact the _All of Us_ support center.

Privacy and Copyright Protection
================================

Our privacy policy explains how we treat your personal information and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By choosing to participate in _All of Us_ and by completing a consent document, you agree that _All of Us_ can use your information in the ways explained in our privacy policy and the consent document. You may change your mind and withdraw your consent later; the limits of withdrawing your consent are explained in the consent document.

Your Responses and Information in _All of Us_
=============================================

All information collected from you by _All of Us_ is described in the online electronic consent you complete when you create your account.

You can find more information about how _All of Us_ uses and stores your content in the privacy policy, on our website ([www.joinallofus.org](http://www.joinallofus.org/)), and within any consent documents that you agree to.

About Software in our Services
==============================

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

Participation in _All of Us_ provides you with a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by _All of Us_. This license is only to allow you to participate in the _All of Us_ Research Program. You may not copy, change, give out, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software. You also may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software without permission from _All of Us_, unless there are laws that say you can do so.

Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that allow some things that are otherwise not allowed by these terms.

Modifying and Terminating our Services
======================================

We are constantly changing and improving. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.

You can stop using our Services at any time, although we'll be sorry to see you go. The _All of Us_ Research Program may also stop providing Services to you, or limit or expand our Services, at any time.

We believe that you own your information and preserving your access to your information is important. If we discontinue a Service, whenever reasonably possible, we will give you advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.

Our Warranties and Disclaimers
==============================

We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don't promise about our Services.

OTHER THAN AS SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS AND MATERIALS, NEITHER THE _All of Us_ RESEARCH PROGRAM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES "AS IS".

SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.

Liability for our Services
==========================

AS PERMITTED BY LAW, THE _All of Us_ RESEARCH PROGRAM, AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE _All Of Us_ RESEARCH PROGRAM, ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

IN ALL CASES, _All of Us_ AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

About these Terms
=================

We may change these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We will post notices of modifications to these terms on this page. We'll post notices of modified additional terms in the Service those terms apply to. Changes will not apply retroactively, only going forward, and most changes will become effective at least fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes required by new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you may discontinue your use of that Service.

If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will make changes to fix that conflict.

These terms control the relationship between the _All of Us_ Research Program and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

If you do not follow these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not change any other terms.

Venue and Jurisdiction. You and "Services" both agree that, except as described in the next two paragraphs, (i) any claim or dispute regarding "Services" will be resolved exclusively by a federal or state court located in Fairfax, Virginia, and (ii) we each agree and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts for litigating any claims or disputes.  
  
Dispute Resolution. If you have a dispute with "Services", you agree to contact us and try to resolve the dispute in good faith before pursuing other avenues.
