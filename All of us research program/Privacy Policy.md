There's a gap in medical research that only you can fill.
=========================================================

The _All of Us_ Research Program has a simple mission. We want to speed up health research breakthroughs. To do this, we’re asking one million people to share health information. In the future, researchers can use this to conduct thousands of health studies.

What Is the _All of Us_ Research Program?
-----------------------------------------

_All of Us_ is a new research program from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal is to advance precision medicine. Precision medicine is health care that is based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Precision medicine’s goal is to be able to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, precision medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best.

To get there, we need one million or more people. Those who join will share information about their health over time. Researchers will study this data. What they learn could improve health for generations to come. Participants are our partners. We’ll share information back with them over time.

### How It Works

![Participants Share Data](waf-failover/images/participants-share-data-icon_0.png)

##### Participants Share Data

Participants share health data online. This data includes health surveys and electronic health records. Participants also may be asked to share physical measurements and blood and urine samples.

##### Data Is Protected

Personal information, like your name, address, and other things that easily identify participants will be removed from all data. Samples—also without any names on them—are stored in a secure biobank.

##### Researchers Study Data

In the future, approved researchers will use this data to conduct studies. By finding patterns in the data, they may make the next big medical breakthroughs.

##### Participants Get Information

Participants will get information back about the data they provide, which may help them learn more about their health.

##### Researchers Share Discoveries

Research may help in many ways. It may help find the best ways for people to stay healthy. It may also help create better tests and find the treatments that will work best for different people.

What Will Participants Do?
--------------------------

When you join the _All of Us_ Research Program, you will be asked to enroll, give consent, and agree to share health records. You can do this online, or at one of our partner centers.

If you take part, you will be asked to complete health surveys. You may be asked for physical measurements and biosamples (blood and urine samples).

You may be invited to share more data in the future, through additional health surveys, health trackers, or other research studies.
