When and Why We Disclose Data

We will disclose (give out) data that we collect through the _All of Us_ website and app only for the reasons we list here. Other than these reasons, we will not sell, rent, lease, give, or share your data without your permission.

Reasons we disclose data:

1.     **For research.** The purpose of _All of Us_ is to help researchers make discoveries. Study data we collect through the app and website will be stored in the _All of Us_ research database. Researchers will use this database for their studies. You can learn more about the use of your study data in the consent forms, the [FAQs](https://www.joinallofus.org/en/faq) on our website, and the _All of Us_ [Privacy and Security webpage](https://www.joinallofus.org/privacy-safeguards).  
  

2.     **To service providers**. If we work with a service provider, we will give them any data they need to do the job we have asked them to do. A service provider is someone who is helping us with a part of _All of Us_. The service provider will have to sign a contract promising to use the data only for the job they are doing for us. Also, they will promise to keep the data safe and do not re-share outside their organization.  
  

3.     **For legal reasons.** We may give out data if we are required to by law. Otherwise, we will not give out data in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.

In cases where the law says we are required to give out data, we will try to give out as little data as possible. We will try to protect your privacy as much as we can. Whenever possible, we will tell you if we have to give out data.
