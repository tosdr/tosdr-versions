### **1\. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

1.1           Description. 9GAG is an online platform and social media website that allows users to upload and share user-generated content. It is a leading platform for entertainment content with millions of daily visitors. As used in this EULA, “**User**” means any user of the Service.

1.2           Eligibility.  IN THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13.  FOR USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR PERSONS UNDER THE AGE FOR WHICH RULES APPLY ON A AGE-BASED BASIS FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA (“**RESTRICTED AGE**”).  IN ALL CASES, THE SERVICE IS NOT FOR ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY 9GAG.  IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE RESTRICTED AGE IN THE TERRITORY WHERE YOU RESIDE, THEN YOU MUST NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.  Furthermore, by using the Service, you affirm that either you are at least 18 years of age or have been authorized to use the Service by your parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age and entered into this EULA on your behalf.  If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity or organization, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to this EULA and you agree to be bound by this EULA on behalf of that entity or organization.

1.3           Changes.  As the Service may undergo changes over time, we need the right to modify this EULA to match the changing functionalities of the Service.  You therefore agree that 9GAG may change this EULA at any time without prior notice other than posting an updated EULA to the 9GAG website or within our App. 9GAG will endeavor to provide you with prior notice when there are any material changes, and may require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging agreement to the revised EULA before continuing to access the Service.  You may read a current, effective copy of this EULA at any time at [https://about.9gag.com/tos/](https://about.9gag.com/tos/) .  The revised EULA will become effective at the time of posting on the Service, and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your acceptance of the revised EULA.  If any change to this EULA is not acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 1.3, no revisions to this EULA will apply to any dispute between you and 9GAG that arose prior to the effective date of those revisions.

1.4           Consideration. 9GAG currently provides you with access to the Service for free.  In return for enjoying this free access, you acknowledge and agree that 9GAG may generate revenues (including, by way of example and not limitation, through the sale of advertising and sponsorships, and the sublicensing of your User Content), increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of 9GAG from your use of the Service, and you will have no right to share in any such revenues, goodwill or value whatsoever.  9GAG in its sole discretion may eventually charge you fees to access certain features on the Service.  9GAG will provide you with advance notice of any such changes before they take effect.  Even if we charge you a fee for the use of the Service, you will have no right to share in the revenues we charge you or other Users or to share in any goodwill or value created. 

1.5           Privacy Policy. Your access to and use of the Service is also subject to 9GAG’s Privacy Policy located [here](https://about.9gag.com/privacy), the terms and conditions of which are incorporated herein by reference.

1.7           Mobile Services.  The Service will be accessible via a mobile phone, tablet or other wireless device (collectively, “**Mobile Services**”).  Your mobile carrier’s normal messaging, data and other rates and fees will apply to your use of the Mobile Services.  In addition, downloading, installing or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.  Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile device(s), what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you.  Nevertheless, all use of the Service and the related Mobile Services must be in accordance with this EULA.

1.8           Additional Terms.  9GAG may require you to agree to additional terms and/or policies that it makes available to you from time-to-time in connection with your use of the Service (“**Additional Terms**”), including the [9GAG Rules](https://about.9gag.com/rules).  Except as expressly stated otherwise in Additional Terms, such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into and subject to this EULA, and this EULA will control in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency, unless such Additional Terms expressly supersede a term in this EULA.

1.9           Fun Off Contest Rules.  By signing up, entering into, submitting User Content in connection with, or otherwise participating in a [9GAG Fun Off](https://funoff.9gag.com/) contest, you agree that you have read and understood, and, as a condition to your entering into the contest, you agree to be bound by the 9GAG Fun Off Contest Rules located [here](https://funoff.9gag.com/terms-conditions) (“**Content** **Rules**”). The Contest Rules are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, this EULA.  To the extent there is a conflict between the Contest Rules and this EULA, the Contest Rules will govern.

You authorize 9GAG and our Payment Processors to charge all sums for the purchases that you make on the Website.  Any processing or other transaction fees, whether imposed by an issuing bank of a credit card or Payment Processor involved in the processing of a payment transaction, are the sole responsibility of the User, as established by the Payment Processor.  You must be authorized to use the payment method used to make purchases through the Service.  9GAG may seek pre-authorization of your credit card prior to a purchase or charge to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.  These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge.  Charges for Merchandise occur within a reasonable time of the transaction or shortly thereafter, and 9GAG reserves the right to aggregate multiple charges together into one transaction where such multiple charges occur in close proximity to one another.  This aggregation will help reduce 9GAG’s credit card transaction fees and enable us to continue to offer the Service for free. 

7.7           Taxes.  When you are a buyer of Merchandise, you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and fees arising out of such transaction.  You agree to indemnify and hold 9GAG harmless from any claims by any taxing authority arising out of your purchase of Merchandise on or through the Service.

7.8           Refunds and Exchanges.  ALL SALES OF MERCHANDISE FROM THE SERVICE (BUT NOT NECESSARILY FROM EXTERNAL SERVICES) ARE FINAL, and 9GAG does not offer refunds for any purchased Merchandise.  If the Merchandise you purchased is misprinted, damaged, or defective, then in order to be eligible to exchange the Merchandise, you must submit a claim to us by sending an email to [shop@9gag.com](mailto:shop@9gag.com) within four weeks from the date of receipt of the Merchandise.  If you do not receive your purchased Merchandise and believe it was lost in transit, then in order to be eligible to receive replacement Merchandise, you must submit a claim to us by sending an email to [shop@9gag.com](mailto:shop@9gag.com) within four weeks of the estimated delivery date. 9GAG is not obligated to provide you with any exchanges or replacement merchandise if you fail to comply with the timing requirements set forth in this Section 7.8.

7.9           Cancellation of Payments and Purchases.  Payments and purchases may not be cancelled by the User, except as required by law.  However, 9GAG reserves the right to refuse or terminate any purchase or attempted purchase at any time in its sole discretion.  You understand and agree that if you authorize a payment transaction with your credit card, debit card or other payment method, but your charge is rejected for any reason, there may be a hold on your use of that transaction amount for several days.

7.10         Disputed Charges.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTES REGARDING ANY CHARGE TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR CREDIT CARDS FOR PURCHASES THROUGH THE SERVICE (BUT NOT ANY EXTERNAL SERVICES) IN WRITING TO 9GAG WITHIN 60 DAYS OF SUCH CHARGE, OTHERWISE SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE WAIVED AND SUCH CHARGE WILL BE FINAL AND NOT SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE.

  
  

### **8\. EXTERNAL SERVICES**

The Service may contain links to or the ability to share information with third party websites and services (“**External Services**”), including through features that allow you to link your Account on 9GAG with an account on an External Service, such as Facebook and Google.  9GAG does not endorse any External Services or the content made available on such External Services.  All External Services and any content thereon is developed and provided by others.  You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Services if you have any concerns regarding such content located on such External Services.  9GAG is not responsible for the content of any External Services and does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of any materials on such External Services.  You should take precautions when downloading files from all websites to protect your computer and mobile devices from viruses and other destructive programs.  If you decide to access any External Services, purchase any content from External Services or subscribe to services offered by such External Service, then you do so at your own risk.  You agree that 9GAG will have no liability to you arising from your use, engagement, exposure to or interaction with any External Services.

  
  

### **9\. TERM AND TERMINATION**

9.1           Term.  As between you and 9GAG, the term of this EULA commences as of your first use of the Service and continues until the termination of this EULA by either you or 9GAG. 

9.2           Termination.  You may terminate this EULA by sending written notification to 9GAG at [support@9gag.com](mailto:support@9gag.com), deleting your Account, deleting the App from your mobile devices, and terminating all other uses of the Service.  If you wish to delete any of your User Content from the Service, then you can ask 9GAG to do so for you by contacting 9GAG at [support@9gag.com](mailto:support@9gag.com).  9GAG will delete your User Content within 30 days of receipt of your request.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the revocation of any license grant from you to 9GAG will not be effective until 60 days following 9GAG’s receipt of such revocation notice; provided, however, that your license grant to 9GAG for your User Content will be irrevocable with respect to backup copies made of your User Content in the ordinary course of business. 9GAG reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend or terminate this EULA and your access to all or any part of the Service at any time without prior notice or liability if you breach any provision of this EULA or violate the rights of any third party copyright owner.  9GAG may further terminate this EULA immediately for any other reason with or without notice to you, using the email address associated with your account credentials.  9GAG reserves the right to change, suspend or discontinue all or any part of the Service at any time without prior notice or liability.

9.3           Survival.  Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5, 7.3, 7.5, 7.7, 7.8, 7.10, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.1, and all defined terms used therein will survive the termination of this EULA indefinitely.  

### **10\. NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTS**

10.1         Respect of Third Party Rights.  9GAG respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and 9GAG asks Users to do the same.  Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.

10.2         Repeat Infringer Policy.  9GAG’s intellectual property policy is to: (i) remove or disable access to material that 9GAG believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Service; and (ii) remove any User Content uploaded to the Service by “repeat infringers.”  9GAG considers a “repeat infringer” to be any User that has Posted User Content and for whom 9GAG has received more than three takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content.  9GAG has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon 9GAG’s own determination. 

10.3         Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.  If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “**Notification of Claimed Infringement**” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below.  Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by 9GAG with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to 9GAG making such disclosure.  Your communication must include substantially the following:

a. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;

b.  Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works;

c.    Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit 9GAG to locate the material;

d.  Information reasonably sufficient to permit 9GAG to contact you, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;

e.    A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and

f.  A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 

You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 or other applicable laws to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement. 

10.4         Designated Agent Contact Information.  9GAG’s designated agent for receipt of Notifications of Claimed Infringement (the “**Designated Agent**”) can be contacted at:

10.5         Counter Notification.  If you receive a notification from 9GAG that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide 9GAG with what is called a “**Counter Notification**.”  To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to 9GAG’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 10.4 and include substantially the following information:

a.    A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;

b.   Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;

c.   A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and

d.   The subscriber’s name, address and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which 9GAG may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 10.3 above or an agent of such person.

A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 or other applicable laws to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.

10.6         Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.  If you submit a Counter Notification to 9GAG in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then 9GAG will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that 9GAG will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and 9GAG will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless 9GAG’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on 9GAG’s system or network.

10.7         False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.  The United States Copyright Act provides that: any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)\] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of 9GAG relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

17 U.S.C. § 512(f). 

9GAG reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of applicable law.

  

### **11\. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER**

THE FOLLOWING TERMS IN THIS SECTION 11 APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:

11.1         NEITHER 9GAG NOR ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**9GAG PARTIES**”) MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, APPROPRIATENESS, TIMELINESS OR RELIABILITY THEREOF.  THE 9GAG PARTIES WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR THE TRUTH, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, OR FOR ERRORS, MISTAKES OR OMISSIONS THEREIN, OR FOR ANY DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS OF THE DATA, OR INFORMATION STREAMED ON THE SERVICE FROM WHATEVER CAUSE.  AS A USER, YOU AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT THEREON AT YOUR OWN RISK.  YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CONTENT YOU UPLOAD TO THE SERVICE.

11.2         THE 9GAG PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL OPERATE ERROR FREE, OR THAT THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT THEREON ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES.  IF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT THEREON RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, NO 9GAG PARTY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS. 

11.3         THE SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT THEREON AND ANY MERCHANDISE PURCHASED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  ACCORDINGLY, THE 9GAG PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES THERETO, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES’ RIGHTS AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 

11.4         ALL MERCHANDISE PURCHASED ON THE WEBSITE, WHETHER PURCHASED FROM 9GAG OR A THIRD PARTY, ARE SUBJECT ONLY TO ANY APPLICABLE WARRANTIES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND SUPPLIERS, IF ANY.  9GAG HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE MERCHANDISE LISTED OR PURCHASED ON THE WEBSITE.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, 9GAG HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR PRODUCT DEFECT OR FAILURE, CLAIMS THAT ARE DUE TO NORMAL WEAR, PRODUCT MISUSE, ABUSE, PRODUCT MODIFICATION, IMPROPER PRODUCT SELECTION, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ANY CODES, OR MISAPPROPRIATION.  9GAG MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO THOSE DEFINED AS “CONSUMERS” IN THE MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY-FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IMPROVEMENTS ACT.

11.5         IN NO EVENT WILL ANY 9GAG PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION RESULTING FROM, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE AND ANY CONTENT THEREON, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH 9GAG PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  9GAG’S LIABILITY, AND THE LIABILITY OF ANY OTHER 9GAG PARTIES, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO U.S. $100.

11.6         TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE AND NOT LIMITATION, ANY CARRIER, COPYRIGHT OWNER OR OTHER USER, IS DIRECTLY BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH THIRD PARTY, AND YOU IRREVOCABLY RELEASE THE 9GAG PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

  

### **12\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

12.1         General.  In the interest of resolving disputes between you and 9GAG in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and 9GAG agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this EULA or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to this EULA or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this EULA.  **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND 9GAG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION**.

12.2         Exceptions.  Notwithstanding Section 12.1 above, nothing in this EULA will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable national, federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

12.3         Arbitrator.  Any arbitration between you and 9GAG will be administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“**HKIAC**”) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules (“**HKIAC Rules**”), as modified by this EULA.  The HKIAC Rules are available online at [http://www.hkiac.org](http://www.hkiac.org/) or by contacting 9GAG.  The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

12.4         Notice; Process.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by mail (“**Notice**”) or, if an address is not available to such party, to the email address of such party as made available on or through the Service.  9GAG’s address for Notice is: 1104, 11/F, Crawford House, 70 Queen’s Road Central, Central, Hong Kong, Attn: General Counsel or by email to copyright@9gag.com.  The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”).  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or 9GAG may commence an arbitration proceeding.  Any arbitration under this Section will be conducted in English. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or 9GAG must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by 9GAG prior to selection of an arbitrator, 9GAG will pay you the highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (2) the last written settlement amount offered by 9GAG in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (3) $15,000.

12.5         Fees.  If you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, 9GAG will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the HKIAC Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Hong Kong, but you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone or videoconference hearing; or (iii) if the claim is for $15,000 or less, by an in-person hearing as established by the HKIAC Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the HKIAC Rules.  In that case, you agree to reimburse 9GAG for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the HKIAC Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision in English sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

12.6         No Class Actions.  YOU AND 9GAG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and 9GAG agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

12.7         Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.  Except as otherwise provided in this EULA, if 9GAG makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to 9GAG’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending 9GAG written notice within 30 days of the change to 9GAG’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and 9GAG.

12.8         Enforceability.  If Section 12.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 12  is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 will be null and void.

  

### **13\. INDEMNITY**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the 9GAG Parties from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from: (a) your breach of this EULA; (b) your access to, use or misuse of 9GAG Content or the Service; or (c) your User Content.  9GAG will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit or proceeding.  9GAG reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section if 9GAG believes that you are unwilling or incapable of defending 9GAG’s interests.  In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting 9GAG’s defense of such matter at your expense.

  

### **14\. CONSENT TO ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS**

By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from 9GAG as further described in the [Privacy Policy](https://about.9gag.com/privacy).  Please read the [Privacy Policy](https://about.9gag.com/privacy) to learn more about your choices regarding 9GAG’s electronic communications practices.  You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that 9GAG sends to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.

  

### **15\. GENERAL**

15.1         Miscellaneous.  This EULA is governed by the internal substantive laws of Hong Kong without respect to its conflict of laws provisions.  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and 9GAG as a result of this EULA or use of the Service.  If any provision of this EULA is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this EULA, which will remain in full force and effect.  Failure of 9GAG to act on or enforce any provision of this EULA will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this EULA.  No waiver will be effective against 9GAG unless made in writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.  Except as expressly agreed by 9GAG and you, this EULA constitutes the entire agreement between you and 9GAG with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein.  The Section headings are provided merely for convenience and will not be given any legal import.  This EULA will inure to the benefit of 9GAG’s successors and assigns.  You may not assign this EULA or any of the rights or licenses granted hereunder, directly or indirectly, without the prior express written consent of 9GAG.  9GAG may assign this EULA, including all its rights hereunder, without restriction. 

15.2         Notice Regarding Apple.  You acknowledge that this EULA is between you and 9GAG only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the App or the content thereof.  Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.  In the event of any failure of any App to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price for the relevant App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.  Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to:  (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that any App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.  Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that any App or your possession and use of any App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights.  You agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the App.  Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, and upon your acceptance of this EULA, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this EULA against you as a third party beneficiary of this EULA.  You hereby represent and warrant that: (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (2) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.  If 9GAG provides a translation of the English language version of this EULA, then the translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English version will prevail.
