Editorial Independence
======================

PCWorld earns revenue through a mixture of responsible advertising (we do not accept gambling or pornographic ads), clearly marked up sponsored content, and affiliate links.

Affiliate links are those that you may click on within our content that take you to an online retailer or manufacturer to learn more about its products. Should you purchase goods from the vendor, we may be paid a small commission.

As an Amazon Associate and a partner with Awin, CJ, Impact, Rakuten, Tradedoubler, Webgains and other affiliate services, we earn on qualifying purchases.

**This does not affect our editorial independence, or how we review the products and services we recommend.**

Affiliate links are generated automatically by the site, and do not apply to all the products we cover. Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.

Any recommendation (or criticism) is based on our experts believing that the product is the best (or not the best) in its class.
