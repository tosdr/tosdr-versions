We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors.

(c)              Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, we validate your credit card at the time you place the order and we charge your credit card as soon as the order is shipped. We accept VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, FSA/HSA cards, and PayPal for all purchases.

(b)              Free standard shipping is available only on each order in excess over $60.00 (exclusive of taxes and shipping charges).

For international orders, please check out our [International Distributors](https://www.weareverincontinence.com/international-distributors/) page to see if there is a distributor in your country.

(d)              We ship the majority of our orders via USPS. If you need your order to ship via a specific carrier, please call our toll-free number [1-866-379-8198](tel:+18778947901) to have a representative give you a quote on the cost and take the order.

(f)               Title and risk of loss pass to you upon our transfer of the products to the carrier/delivery. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments.

1. Returns and Refunds; Promotions. Except for any products designated on the Site or within these Terms as non-returnable, which includes “final sale” items, we will accept a return of the products for a refund of your purchase price, less the original shipping and handling costs, provided such return is made within 60 (sixty) days of date of delivery, and provided such products are returned in their original factory packaging. Remember, the items returned should not be opened, washed, or worn. Please do not return any items that have been opened, washed, or worn as we will not accept them or issue a refund. We will honor the First Pair Guarantee set forth in Section 6, First Pair Guarantee and Limitation of Liability, without that item being returned.

To return products, you must comply with the following process:

(a)              Fill out the return form at the bottom of the packing slip.

(b)              Make sure all items are in the original factory packaging. Remember, the items returned should not be opened, washed, or worn.

You bear the risk of loss during shipment. We therefore strongly recommend that you fully insure your return shipment against loss or damage and that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery for your protection. Wearever will gladly cover the shipping of the new products only back to you as part of our First Pair Guarantee. We will process your refund per our policy, when we receive the return. If you would like a different item, please place a new order for that item. If you need assistance with placing a new order, please call us at 1-866-379-8198.
