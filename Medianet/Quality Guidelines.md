Ad Quality Policy
-----------------

### Media.net Ad Quality Policy

Media.net is committed to providing a fair value exchange between buyers, sellers and users and to that purpose, Media.net uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide participating buyers and sellers with a safe, transparent, and fair marketplace. We expect our advertising partners to follow certain policies on quality and behavior of ads and landing pages that are permitted through our platform(s).

By using the Media.net platform and services, each Advertiser/Demand side partner (hereafter referred to as Buyer(s)) agrees to these Policies, which may be updated at any time by posting notice of such changes on our website or by otherwise providing notice. All Buyer(s) understand that it is their sole responsibility to keep themselves updated on all policies available here. Media.net reserves the right to reject, suspend, or remove from its platforms any Buyer(s) at its sole discretion. These policies do not limit Media.net’s discretion in any way.

Buyer(s) shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Media.net and its affiliates, and each of their officers, directors, employees and agents (each an “Indemnified Party”) from all third party claims and liabilities (including reasonable attorney’s fees and legal costs) arising from or relating to (a) any violation of this Ad Quality Policy by Buyer(s) (even if an exception has been granted), (b) any violation of applicable laws, rules, or regulations (even if an exception has been granted), or (c) any infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property right of a third party (even if an exception has been granted). Buyer(s) will also be responsible for complying with Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) and California Business and Professions Code Section 22580 (“BPC 22580”) regulations based on relevant flags transmitted in bid requests.

### I. Platform Policies

* Buyer(s) may only purchase inventory for use directly by an advertiser (or direct agent of an advertiser) with which you have a direct relationship.
* Reselling, distributing or otherwise sub-syndicating inventory to another indirect sales channel (e.g., another ad network or trading desk) is prohibited.
* Buyer(s) may not create targeting profiles or segments or use any targeting profiles or segments to show ads to users if such profiles or segments may lead to discriminatory treatment of a user (including but not limited to ads in relation to housing, credit, insurance, and employment).
* Buyer(s) will comply with the applicable Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles published at youradchoices.com/principles and, as applicable, with the IAB Europe EU Framework for Online Behavioral Advertising and the EASA Best Practice Recommendation on Online Behavioral Advertising, which are administered by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance and published at [www.edaa.eu](https://www.edaa.eu/). They shall also comply with the enhanced notice obligations applicable to Third Parties as defined in the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles.
* Buyer(s) must provide consumers with comprehensible notice of their privacy practices, including, where appropriate, enhanced notice of behavioral targeting through mechanisms such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AdChoices” icon. Advertisers that engage in behavioral advertising must also provide consumers with the ability to opt out of such targeted advertising. Buyer(s) must respect all user opt out and/or privacy signals.
* All ads placed through the Media.net’s platforms must comply with the Ad Standards and Creative Guidelines set out by the Internet Advertising Bureau at [http://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-standard-ad-unit-portfolio/](http://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-standard-ad-unit-portfolio/) unless otherwise authorized. Ads must also comply with the Better Ads Standards and not engage in any of the “least preferred ad experiences” as identified by the Coalition for Better Ads.
