Inventory Policies
------------------

### Media.net Inventory Policies

Media.net is committed to providing a fair value exchange between buyers, sellers and users and to that purpose, Media.net uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide participating buyers and sellers with a safe, transparent, and fair marketplace. Media.net uses a combination of proprietary tools, third party partners and manual monitoring teams to review, approve and monitor the quality of inventory. Inventory may include websites, mobile applications and/or other digital media properties made available for sale of inventory via Media.net’s platforms and services (“Sites”).

By using the Media.net platform and services, each Publisher (ie. owner or authorized operator of Sites) agrees to these Policies, which may be updated at any time by posting notice of such changes on our website or by otherwise providing notice. All publishers understand that it is their sole responsibility to keep themselves updated on all policies available here.
