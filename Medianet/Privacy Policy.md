Media.net takes your privacy extremely seriously and hence shall never use personally identifiable information to target any advertising. Our privacy policy available at [www.media.net/privacy-policy](https://www.media.net/privacy-policy) details the principles we stand by as regards the data we collect and use through our services.

Having said that, at Media.net, we work hard to build technology that delivers two kinds of relevant advertising—contextual ads based on the content you are reading and interest-based ads, which are based on your web surfing. We strive to stay one step ahead of you, so we can be the first to let you know of a discount on the new pair of jeans you have been eyeing or show you special fares on the holiday you have been researching.

We do this with the help of cookies which collect useful non-personally identifiable data. If you don't want to see ads personalized to your interests from Media.net, you may do so by selecting the opt-out choice on this page. In addition, please note that third parties may collect data on this Website for purposes that include interest-based advertising.
