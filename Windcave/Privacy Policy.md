Windcave uses your data that it collects only where we have a valid legal basis to do so. We may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interest or those of another person or as required or permitted by applicable laws or regulations. In addition, we may also process your data where we believe it is in our or others legitimate interests after taking into consideration your own interest and rights along with the applicable legal requirements.

* **To process Transactions:** we will need to use your personal data to obtain authorization for Transactions from your payment card’s issuing bank (the bank that issued your credit or debit card) and from the acquirer of record for the Transaction. Some details from the Transaction (such as name, email, and delivery address) may be made available to the Merchant or acquirer through **Payline** which is Windcave’s web-based transactions management system. In addition, and separate from its performance of the services set out in this Privacy Policy, Windcave may aggregate and disclose aggregated data that is not personally identifiable (i.e. anonymized personal data) to its partners or third parties. This aggregated, non-identifiable (i.e. anonymized personal data) data may be used for statistical analysis or similar purposes. However, Windcave does not sell your personal data to third parties and apart from processing Transactions as described in the section below “Automated Decisions” we do not use automated decision making.
* **To communicate with you including to fulfill your requests:** where you have provided us with your personal data in the context of obtaining our services as a Merchant we might use your personal data in order to respond to your contact request, to respond to your request for proposal or offer if you are interested in contracting with us; or we may contact you if we are interested in doing business with you, to respond to your job application or otherwise communicate with you or to carry out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between you and us including to notify you of changes to our services or products.
* **To onboard Merchants:** we will need to use personal data of the directors and shareholders of the Merchants to undertake our due diligence processes and fulfil our legal, regulatory and risk requirements and or fulfil our legitimate business interests.
* **To provide you with access to Payline:** to access our services as a Merchant we will use your information to provide you with access to Payline.
* **To provide you with marketing materials:** where you have provided us with your personal data in the context of obtaining our services as a Merchant, we may also use your information for marketing our own and selected business partners’ products and services to you. We will provide an option to unsubscribe or opt out of further communication on any electronic marketing communication sent to you or you may opt out by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://sec.windcave.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). When we do this, we will be relying on our legitimate business interests to keep you updated with news about our products and services.

In addition, we may need to use your personal data to comply with our regulatory requirements or dialogue with regulators as applicable, which may include disclosing your personal data to third parties, the court service and/or regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with enquiries, proceedings, or investigations by such parties anywhere in the world or where compelled to do so.

* **To improve our service and products:** We collect and use your data to provide features of our services and to improve and customize our service.

In relation to the lawful basis and purposes of data processing and the categories of data processed for the European (**EU**) and UK, please refer to section 9 below, which is also relevant for other applicable laws that may require more detailed disclosures pertaining to the purpose of our processing of your personal data.

#### Automated Decisions

We do not make automated decisions in relation to personal data other than when providing our services to process payment transactions. This means that we may use technology that can evaluate factors to predict or detect risks or fraudulent outcomes or to tokenize personal data during the payment transaction process. We do this for the risk management and efficient running of our services. This automated decision making is necessary for Windcave’s compliance with its regulatory obligations and for performance of Windcave’s contractual obligations to Merchants.

4\. Data Security
-----------------

Windcave is committed to data security. We use a variety of technologies and adhere to a broad range of security standards to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Sensitive data is stored on Windcave owned and managed infrastructure located in Windcave controlled facilities, secured by industry standard surveillance and security technologies. The data is also secured during transit and at rest using industry standard encryption meeting PCI, ISO, and SOC2 Security Standards for which Windcave is compliant. Windcave adheres to the following data processing principles:

* we collect personal data only for defined and legal purposes;
* we process personal data honestly and only for the primary purpose;
* we store personal data for no longer than the established purposes or applicable law requires;
* we entrust the processing of personal data only to employees who have been granted permission to do so;
* we process personal data only by applying appropriate technical and organizational measures;
* we disclose personal data to third parties only if there is a legal basis;
* if applicable, we inform the responsible authorities about recorded or suspected violations of personal data security;
* we periodically conduct data protection training for our employees;
* we perform periodic internal and/or external IT security audits;
* we change, adapt, and constantly improve various processes to ensure the safest possible processing of personal data including reviewing the collection, reception, transmission and use.

We regularly monitor our systems for possible violations or attacks. Still, it is impossible to ensure complete security of information transmitted over the Internet or to prevent breaches, especially those that may occur due to your carelessness or disclosure of data to others. Taking this into account, we note that you also bear the personal risk of submitting personal data using the Internet connection through the Payline and the Website. You also maintain the entire risk related to the voluntary disclosure of your Account data to others and/or the careless use of your personal data you receive directly from us.

5\. Data Retention
------------------

Windcave’s retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and local legal requirements. We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected and any other permitted related purpose. For example, we may retain the information you provided to use the service you requested and until the time limit for claims which may arise from those services has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirement regarding the retention of such data. If we are using your personal data for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expired but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period once that expires. Generally, we will retain your personal data for up to 10 years to enable us to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal data, we will delete it from our systems (either by erasing or anonymizing that data). After that time, we may retain aggregated and anonymized data (from which you cannot be identified) and retain it for analytical and statistical purposes.

In relation to data retention practices for the EU and UK, please refer to section 9 below.

6\. Transfer of Data
--------------------

Windcave may transfer your information to jurisdictions outside of your jurisdiction of residence, and those jurisdictions may have information protection rules that are different from and less stringent than those of your jurisdiction of residence. Windcave stores and processes information in countries where we operate offices: New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Lithuania and Malta. Further, your information may be accessible to law enforcement, national security authorities, and the courts of such jurisdictions. If you have questions about our practices with respect to our use of service providers outside of your jurisdiction of residence, please contact our Data Protection Officer, whose contact details are set out in section 13 below.

Windcave takes measures to ensure that information transfers comply with applicable laws and that your information remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk and you accept all liability for such risk, to the extent legally permissible. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

See also section 9 below for more details on transfers outside of the EU/UK.

We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those specified in the CCPA/CPRA.

**“Do Not Track” (DNT) and Universal Opt-Out Preference Signals:**

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (**DNT**) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have their online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many web service operators, including Windcave, do not proactively respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit http://allaboutdnt.com.

New standards are being developed for a Universal Opt-Out Mechanism, such as the Global Privacy Control (**GPC**), which allow users with GPC-enabled browsers and devices to send a signal that will communicate the user’s request to opt-out of sales of their personal information and to opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information. The CPRA and other laws allow for the acceptance of Opt-Out Preference Signals such as the GPC, as an option for users to transmit an Opt-Out of selling/sharing personal information. If we detect and recognize such a signal from your device or browser, we will honor it.

You have a number of rights in relation to managing your personal data under applicable data protection law including the GDPR. In relation to certain rights, we may ask you for information to confirm your identity and location, where applicable, to help us to search for your personal data.

Subject to certain exceptions, or unless a shorter response time is required under applicable data protection law, we will respond to you within 1 month from either: the date that we have confirmed your identity; or where we do not need to do this because we already have this information, from the date we received your request.

Depending on the applicable data protection law in your jurisdiction, these rights may include:

However, you should be aware that where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request, we will always tell you the reasons for doing so. To exercise this right, contact us via e-mail [\[email protected\]](https://sec.windcave.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we will send you a letter with information (or will explain in person) how you can obtain a copy of your personal data.
* **Right to object to, and/or restrict, processing:** You have the right to object to, or restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.

* **Right to erasure:** You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so. When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data. You have the right to request that we no longer process your personal data (and delete it in some cases) in the event of at least one of the following circumstances:

* **Right to rectification:** You have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. You can also rectify certain of your personal data by logging into the App.

11\. How to exercise Your rights
--------------------------------

To protect our clients' data from unauthorized disclosure, we will need to verify your identity upon receipt of your request to exercise your right(s). To confirm a person's identity, we firstly verify your identity by asking you to provide your account registration information or other information that only you should know. As part of this verification, we may send a verification message (by SMS or e-mail) to the last contact on your account, asking you to take active action. If the verification procedure fails, we will have to declare that you are not a data subject and will have to reject your request.

After receiving your request to exercise your right(s) and when the identity mentioned above verification procedure was successful, we undertake to provide you with information about the actions we took/or did not take in response to your request as soon as possible, but in any case, no later than within 1 (one) month from the date of receipt of your request.

Remember that your rights are not absolute, and we have the right to refuse to fulfil your request with a reasoned written answer under the conditions and grounds provided by legislation. Considering the complexity and number of requests, to the extent allowed by applicable data protection law, we have the right to extend the period of 1 (one) month by another 2 (two) months, informing you about this before the end of the first month and indicating the reasons for such an extension. If your request is submitted electronically, we will also provide you with an answer electronically, unless this is impossible (e.g., due to a substantial amount of information) or when you request to answer in another way. We will provide the information to you free of charge, but if the requests are manifestly unreasonable or disproportionate, in particular, due to its repetitive content, we may charge a reasonable fee (which we would communicate to you in advance) to cover administrative costs or refuse to act on your request.
