**Trade name:** “Wolt",

**Email address:** [support@wolt.com](mailto:support@wolt.com).

Information about the identity and products and services of the Partners are provided in the Wolt Service.

**3\. Description of the Wolt Service**
---------------------------------------

3.1. Wolt provides a technology platform that connects Users, Partners and Courier Partners. Wolt's technology permits the Users to place orders for food and/or other goods from various Partners and Users may also order delivery services. Wolt is not a restaurant, delivery company, or food preparation business.

3.2. The Partner provides the information about their products and possible services in the Wolt Service, including but not limited to information on product characteristics, allergens and instructions of use. If you have allergies or other dietary restrictions or for other reason wish to receive more detailed information about the products, please contact the relevant Partner. You can also contact Wolt's customer support who can contact the Partner on your behalf for such enquiries. The Partner is however responsible for providing accurate, up-to-date and legally required information about the products, including providing information on applicable prices and indicating the price per unit where required under applicable laws. Please note that the sale and purchase of the Partner’s products and possible services may be subject to additional terms and conditions of the Partner or Wolt on a case-by-case basis as set out in the Wolt Service.

3.3. When selecting the Partner’s products and services that the User wishes to purchase from the Partner, the User makes a binding order to purchase the products and services from the Partner on the terms and conditions presented to the User herein and in the Wolt Service before placing the order (“**the** **Order**”). After having received the Order, Wolt will transmit the details of the Order to the Partner. When the Order is accepted by the Partner and Wolt has provided the User with an order confirmation on behalf of the Partner, the User or the Customer Organization and the Partner enter into the Purchase Agreement for the purchase of the Partner's products and, if applicable, delivery or other services. In some cases, the Purchase Agreement for the purchase of the delivery service is entered into with Wolt instead of the Partner, as reflected on the receipt. Wolt will provide the User with a receipt on behalf of the Partner, unless regulation in the country where the User is located requires that the Partner provides the receipt directly to the User, for the products and, to the extent applicable, for the delivery services. The fulfilment of the Order is subject to availability, and Wolt reserves a right, in its sole discretion, to cancel or not to accept an Order.

3.4. If delivery services are ordered, the platform notifies a Courier Partner that a delivery opportunity is available and the technology facilitates completion of the delivery to the User. Partners or Wolt charge Users a delivery fee, service fee and other surcharges (when applicable) for the delivery services as defined in more detail in the Wolt Service where relevant.

3.5. The Partner selected by the User will prepare and/or collect and pack the products set out on the Order. Wolt is not responsible or liable towards the User for the proper execution of the Purchase Agreement by the Partner. While Wolt is not ultimately liable for the delivery services provided by Courier Partners, Wolt may facilitate any compensation to Users for faulty delivery services.

3.6. When you use the Wolt Service, there may be a minimum value for purchase required, in which case you will be notified thereof before you make the Order on the Wolt Service. Where an Order fails to meet the minimum required value, you will have the possibility to pay the difference to meet the minimum value or to add more products to your Order. The Partner determines in its sole discretion the selection and pricing of their products available on the Wolt Service. The Partner may also impose certain restrictions on your Order, such as quantity limits and size limitations of the Order. The Partner is responsible for informing you of any limitation relating to the availability of any products. User accepts that in case a certain product is temporarily unavailable, the Partner will fulfill the remaining part of your Order without including the unavailable product in the Order. You will not be charged for products that are unavailable at the time of placing the Order.

**4\. Right of revocation**
---------------------------

4.1. You cannot withdraw from or cancel an Order for products or services once you have placed it, unless explicitly provided otherwise in these Terms of Service. Prior to placing an Order for a product or service you should carefully review your selection.

4.2. If you are a consumer, you are entitled to a right of revocation in accordance with the statutory provisions of the country where you are located. Consumer in the sense of these Terms of Service means any natural person who uses the Wolt Service and places Orders for a purpose which predominantly cannot be attributed to their commercial or their self-employed professional activity.

4.3. Wolt follows the limitations of consumers' statutory cancellation rights as set out in applicable laws, according to which the right of revocation shall not exist for Purchase Agreements concerning certain items, including, but not limited to, the following:

* products such as foodstuffs which are perishable or which may quickly pass their expiration date,
    
* products made to your specifications or clearly personalized,
    
* sealed products which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons, if such products were unsealed after the delivery,
    
* products which, according to their nature, are inseparably mixed, after delivery, with other items,
    
* sealed games, movies or computer software which were unsealed after delivery.
    

4.4. You have the right to revoke the Purchase Agreement of products, for which the right of revocation exists, within 14 days from the day of delivery of the products on the Order without giving a reason for the cancellation. In order to exercise your right of revocation, you must inform Wolt of your decision to cancel by means of a clear statement (e.g., an email or a message sent through Wolt’s in-app customer service chat) within the said time period of 14 days. The Partner as the trader of the products on your Order has authorized Wolt to receive the revocation notification on the Partner’s behalf. In case the Partner has chosen to offer a longer cancellation period than 14 days, such a period will apply to Orders made through the Wolt Service if explicitly mentioned in the descriptive details for the Partner on the Wolt Service. If you wish, you can use the below model revocation form for making the revocation notification by filling in the information in the form and sending the information to Wolt, which information shall also be forwarded by Wolt to the respective Partner:

_Model revocation form_

\-          _To: \[insert the name of the Partner, the Partner’s address and the Partner’s email address\]:_

\-          _Herewith I/we (\*) revoke the agreement concluded with me/us (\*) regarding the purchase of the following goods (\*)/ the provision of the following services (\*)_

_\-          Ordered on (\*)/received on (\*)_

_\-          Name of the consumer(s)_

_\-          Address of the consumer(s)_

_\-          Signature(s) of the consumer(s) (only in case of notification on paper)_

_\-          Date_

_(\*) Delete as applicable._

4.5. If you revoke the Purchase Agreement, Wolt will refund to you all payments we have received from you, including the delivery fee, service fee and possible surcharges for delivery services (where applicable) no later than 14 days from the date on which we received notice of your revocation of the Purchase Agreement or a part thereof. Note that the delivery fee, service fee and possible surcharges (where applicable) will not be returned in case of only a partial revocation of your Order.

4.6. For making the refund, we will use the same means of payment as you used for the original purchase of your Order, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you. Note that if you paid for the Order with Wolt credits, we shall refund you in Wolt credits. Wolt may refuse a refund until the Partner has received the products back or until you have provided proof that you have returned the products, whichever is earlier.

4.7. You must return or send the products to the same Partner in the same location from which you made the Order. The contact details of the Partner’s point of sale are available on the Wolt Service. You have to return the products to the Partner as soon as possible and in any case no later than 14 days after the day on which you notified us of the revocation of the Purchase Agreement. This period is deemed to have been observed if you dispatch the products before the expiry of the period of 14 days.

4.8. You shall bear the direct costs of returning the products. The returned products have to be in an unused condition and capable of being resold. You shall be liable for any loss in value of the products if such loss in value is due to handling of the products that is not necessary for testing their condition, properties and functionality.

4.9. Sometimes it may be possible that some of the Partner’s products that you wish to purchase through the Wolt Service are temporarily out of stock. For such cases and to the extent the Partner has enabled substitutions, you may choose, prior to confirming your Order, whether you want to allow the Partner to substitute a missing item with a similar item. If you have allowed substitutions for a certain or all items in your Order, the Partner will substitute such missing items in accordance with the following principles: (i) the substitute will be chosen based on what the Partner considers to be the most appropriate substitute so that it corresponds as much as possible to the quantity, quality and price of the original item in the Order; (ii) substances typically causing allergies shall be carefully taken into account so that for example a lactose-free item is only substituted with a lactose-free item and a gluten-free item is only substituted with a gluten-free item; (iii) diet or light drink is substituted with a diet or light drink; (iv) organic is substituted with organic; and (v) domestically produced is substituted with domestically produced. However, please note that a substituted item may be of different flavour than the originally ordered item. You will not be charged for any additional fees or costs for a substituted item compared to the price of the original item in your Order. Should the price of the substitute be lower than the price of the original item in your Order, you will be charged the price of the substitute item.

**5\. User Accounts**
---------------------

5.1. You have a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable right to use the Wolt Service in the form offered to you by us from time to time solely for the purposes set out herein. The license granted to the User for the iOS Wolt App downloaded from Apple’s App Store is further limited to a license to use the Wolt App on any Apple-branded products that the User owns or controls and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service and these Terms of Service.

5.2. In order to use the Wolt Service, the User must create a user account by following the registration instructions in the Wolt Service. The Wolt Service credentials are personal (unless otherwise agreed between Wolt and the Customer Organization). The User shall ensure that any user account credentials and equivalent information required to access the user account of the User or the Customer Organization are kept confidential and used in a secure manner not accessible by third parties. A User may have only one personal user account.

5.3. Where it is suspected that any unauthorized person has become aware of a User’s user account credentials or has access to the user account of the User, the User shall immediately inform Wolt thereof. The User shall be responsible for any use of the Wolt Service and any activity under the user account of the User.

5.4. In order to use the Wolt Service, you must submit valid credit card or other payment method information to Wolt. Wolt does not store information of your payment instrument, as this is done by a third party payment service provider used by Wolt. You agree to pay for all purchases arising from your use of the Wolt Service except for purchases made through the Wolt for Work Feature at the Customer Organization’s cost. You must keep the credit card and other payment information that you have submitted to your user account updated.

**6\. Payments**
----------------

6.1. The User, or the Customer Organization in case of Wolt for Work Account, will pay the purchase price set out in the Order by using the relevant payment functionality of the Wolt Service. Wolt, or the Wolt group company authorized by Wolt, collects all payments from the Users or the Customer Organizations on behalf of the Partner. If the Order is made by using the Wolt for Work Feature, the User confirms the payment on behalf of the Customer Organization through the Wolt for Work Feature. The User’s or Customer Organization’s payment obligation shall arise upon placing an Order through the Wolt Service.

6.2. The User may fulfil this payment obligation only by using the relevant online payment method provided in the Wolt Service. When the User, or the Customer Organization in case of Wolt for Work Account, has paid the purchase price to Wolt, the User or the Customer Organization has fulfilled its payment obligation towards the Partner.

6.3. In Finland, you can fulfil your payment obligation by using a lunch benefit as payment method, if the Wolt Service is compatible with the lunch benefit provided by your employer. You are responsible for ensuring that the Order costs of food products and delivery services paid with the lunch benefit does not exceed the limit of the lunch benefit’s daily value. The amount exceeding this value can be paid with another acceptable payment method in the Wolt Service. You are obligated to comply with the tax administration’s guidelines regarding use of the lunch benefit. Please note for example that the lunch benefit is personal and does not cover purchase of gift cards, utility products, groceries, convenience food or processed food. You are therefore not entitled to buy such products with the lunch benefit through the Wolt Service.

6.4. The payment will be automatically charged from the User’s credit card, lunch benefit or charged through the Customer Organization’s Wolt for Work Feature, upon delivery of the Order. Wolt is entitled to make an authorisation hold on behalf of the Partner on the User’s credit card, lunch benefit or Customer Organization’s Wolt for Work Feature once the Order has been placed through the Wolt Service. Wolt uses a third party payment service provider for processing of payments.

6.5 In certain situations and payment methods the purchase price may vary slightly due to technical foreign exchange rate exchanges between currencies as part of the payment process. Wolt assumes no liability in these currency conversion differences and cannot predict the exact amount to be charged when using payment instruments subject to foreign exchange rate conversions.

6.6. When you add products sold by weight in your Order, Wolt will not know their exact weight until the products are weighed by the Partner. For such weight-based products, any price per product shown on Wolt Service is only an estimate given by the Partner. The final price of the weight-based product in your Order will be determined and charged based on the actual weight of the product you receive. To cover for possible price adjustments caused by weight variation, Wolt will make a temporary authorization hold on your card. The amount of the temporary authorization hold will be at maximum 20% of the value of weight-based products included in your Order. In case the product in your Order weighs less than as indicated in your Order confirmation, Wolt will refund you the price difference. In case the product in your Order weighs more than as indicated in your Order confirmation, Wolt will charge you the price difference from the temporary authorization hold made for weight-based products. Any part of the temporary authorization hold that is not needed for covering for a price adjustment will be returned or refunded to your card. 

**7\. Wolt credits and tokens**
-------------------------------

7.1. The Users of the Wolt Service can obtain Wolt credits or tokens e.g. by inviting new users to sign up to the Wolt Service ("Referral Program"). Under the Referral Program, Wolt may offer its Users the opportunity to earn the opportunity to earn Wolt credits or tokens as promotional rewards by inviting their eligible friends to register as new Wolt Users and place their initial order through the Wolt Service. For each qualified referral, the User may receive credits or tokens as specified on [Wolt Referral Program Terms](https://explore.wolt.com/en/fin/legal/referral-program-terms). You agree that we may change the terms and conditions of the Referral Program or terminate the Referral Program at any time.

7.2. The Users of Wolt Service can also obtain Wolt credits or tokens through promotional campaigns established by Wolt from time to time. You agree that promotional offers: (i) may only be used by the intended audience, for the intended purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public, unless expressly permitted by Wolt; (iii) are subject to the specific terms that Wolt establishes for such promotion or campaign. For instance, promotional offers may be available for certain Users only or may be limited to be used through specific Partners or at a specific time of the day.

7.3. Wolt may unilaterally determine the conditions applicable to the granting, use and validity of the Wolt credits and tokens.

7.4. Any signing-up bonus credits or tokens can be used only once.

7.5. The Users can use Wolt credits and tokens to get discount on their purchases only in the Wolt Service and subject to the specific terms of conditions of the specific campaign or promotion. Wolt credits and tokens cannot be exchanged to cash. The validity period of the Wolt credits and tokens you may have received is specified in the Wolt Service. Upon expiration, credits and tokens will be removed from your account. Expired credits and tokens are no longer redeemable and cannot be used towards any order.

7.6. The Wolt credits and tokens will be nullified if Wolt detects any abuse of Wolt credits or tokens or suspects or detects that Wolt credits or tokens have been granted on incorrect grounds. In such cases, Wolt shall invoice the amount that was paid using such Wolt credits or tokens.

**8\. Delivery of an Order**
----------------------------

8.1. If the User orders the delivery of the Order through the Wolt Service, the Order will be delivered to the location confirmed by the User in the Wolt Service. The User also has to provide a street address for the confirmed location in the Wolt Service. If no-contact delivery is applied to your Order, please note that the goods shall be deemed to be delivered when they are left at the door and the Courier Partner marks the Order status as "delivered" on the Wolt Service after which you bear the risk of the items in the Order.

8.2. The User must be available to receive calls at the phone number the User has submitted to the Wolt Service. If the phone number provided by the User cannot be reached, the delivery may be cancelled by Wolt or the Partner and the User or Customer Organization may be charged for the full price of the Order.

8.3. The User may place an Order to be delivered as soon as possible (standard delivery method) or by pre-ordering a certain delivery time, to the extent these options are available on the Wolt Service at the time of placing the Order.

8.4. Standard delivery option: The User must be present at the confirmed location set out in the Order between the time of making the Order until the products set out in the Order have been received. If the User is not available at the location they have confirmed within five minutes of the arrival of the delivery of the ordered products and the User does not respond after two contact attempts by the Courier Partner making the delivery, the delivery may be cancelled by Wolt or the Partner and the User or Customer Organization may be charged for the full price of the Order.

8.5. “Pre-order” delivery option: the User must be present at the confirmed location between ten minutes prior to the pre-ordered delivery time until the moment of delivery in the Order to receive the Order.

**9\. Picking up and collecting an Order at the Partner’s point of sale**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.1. If the User has not ordered delivery of the Partner’s products set out in the Order, but the collection at the Partner’s point of sale, the products can be collected at the point of sale of the Partner the User has chosen in connection with the Order. The User will receive a separate electronic confirmation when the products are ready for collection. The Partner or Wolt may set conditions for the identification of the User when picking up the products set out in the Order.

9.2. The Partner shall retain the ordered products for 60 minutes after the Partner has notified the User that the Order is ready for collection. However, this obligation is limited to the opening hours of the particular Partner’s point of sale and the Order has to be collected before the closing time of said point of sale of the Partner.

**10\. Eat-in Order**
---------------------

10.1. If the User has selected the option to consume the products set out in the Order at the point of sale of the Partner, the User will receive a separate electronic confirmation about the expected time of when the products will be ready to be consumed at the Partner’s point of sale.

**11\. Time estimates**
-----------------------

11.1. Any delivery time or pick-up time or other time estimate communicated to the User by the Partner or Wolt in the Wolt Service are only estimated times. There is no guarantee that the Order will be delivered or available for pick-up or consumption at the estimated time. Delivery times of the products may also be affected by factors such as traffic jams, rush hours and weather conditions.

**12\. Intellectual Property Rights**
-------------------------------------

12.1. All Intellectual Property Rights in or related to the Wolt Service and thereto related documentation and all parts and copies thereof shall remain exclusively vested with and be the sole and exclusive property of Wolt and/or its affiliates/subcontractors/licensors. “**Intellectual Property Rights**” shall mean copyrights and related rights (including database and catalogue rights and photography rights), patents, utility models, design rights, trademarks, tradenames, trade secrets, know-how and any other form of registered or unregistered intellectual property rights.

If there are any defects or other quality shortcomings in the products of your Order, then you should contact either the customer service of Wolt, acting on behalf of the Partner, or the Partner directly and include a clear description of the defects or shortcomings. Regarding consumer goods, notices of defects should be made within a reasonable time from detecting the defect, however no later than within two months after being detected. Please note that in case of defects in foodstuffs or other products that by their nature spoil or age rapidly, it is crucial that you notify the defect as soon as possible to enable proper investigation and verification of the defect.
