**Privacy Notice for California Residents**

**Summary**

This Privacy Notice for California Residents contains information required by the California Privacy Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended or replaced from time to time, along with any implementing regulations, and supplements our Main Privacy Policy. Dante Labs privacy principles are the same for all customers. For example, all customers can request a copy of their data, request deletion, and control their privacy settings in their Account Settings. This notice makes sure we cover California-specific requirements. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this notice and the Privacy Statement, the terms of this notice prevail.

Here is a summary before we dive into the details:

* You have the right to know whether we sell your Personal Information and opt-out of a sale if we do. **We do not sell your Personal Information or Genomic Data.**
* You have the right to receive an overview of the Personal Information we collect, how we use it, and who we share it with.
* You can request access to your Personal Information, get a copy, and delete your Personal Information.
* You or your authorized agent can always contact us if you have a question at dpo@dantelabs.com

**Your Rights**

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this notice, we mean any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with you, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you, and as otherwise defined in the CCPA. The CCPA does not consider publicly available information as “Personal Information.”

Let’s start with your rights first. You have the right to:

* Know what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, or sell.
* Receive a copy of your Personal Information.
* Delete your Personal Information.
* Not receive discriminatory treatment if you exercise your CCPA rights.

We make it easy to exercise your CCPA rights by making them available through your Account Settings. To access Account Settings, you must log in to your Dante Labs account.

If you do not have a Dante Labs account and would like to make a CCPA rights request, you can email us at [dpo@dantelabs.com](mailto:dpo@dantelabs.com) with the subject line “CCPA Rights Request”. We will require some additional information to verify your identity in order to process your request. Alternatively, you may exercise your CCPA rights through an authorized agent. If you use an authorized agent, we will require you to verify your identity and confirm that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. We will respond to your request within 45 days, and in more difficult cases we may extend our response time by another 45 days. The easiest way to exercise your rights is through your Account Settings so we can quickly verify your identity. Your rights under the CCPA are not absolute and Dante Labs may exercise limitations or exemptions as permitted by the CCPA.

Dante Labs does not sell Personal Information to third parties. The CCPA provides you with the right to know whether your Personal Information is being sold and to opt-out of such sales.
