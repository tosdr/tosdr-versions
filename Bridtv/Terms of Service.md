Terms and Conditions
====================

TERMS AND CONDITIONS TARGETVIDEO

These Terms and Conditions contain legal obligations. Please read them carefully.

The provisions of these Terms and Conditions govern the contractual relationship between TargetVideo and the client (client/publisher, within the following “**Client**”), as far as the individual agreement between the parties does not contain deviating regulations. If so, the respective deviating regulation prevails.

As far as neither the individual agreement nor these Terms and Conditions contain a relevant provision, the „_Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less published by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the American Association of Advertising Agencies (version 3.0)_“ shall apply.

**Payment.**

**General.** The Client agrees to be bound by the commercial terms and conditions that are defined in the Service Order or other individual agreement.

The Client using Native Player Services and/or the Premium Demand Services, shall receive the agreed percentage of the net advertising revenues, generated by TargetVideo, from the integration of ads played on the Client’s website, i.e. all revenues actually paid out to TargetVideo after the deduction of agency and customer discounts, value added tax, and technical costs, including but not limited to streaming costs.

TargetVideo will perform payment towards the Client using Native Player Services and/or the Premium Demand Service, only for months in which earned revenue exceeds $100.00 for the month. TargetVideo reserves the right to charge an ad-serving fee to cover actual ad-serving costs. Revenue which is not paid to the Client in any month will be credited to the account of the Client and paid later when accrued revenue exceeds $100.00.

The Client shall keep his/her payment address, email address, bank account number and telephone number in his/her account up-to-date. If the Client fails to notify TargetVideo of any changes in his/her account information, rendering TargetVideo unable to notify the Client in writing, the established business cooperation shall be terminated without notice and without any liability of TargetVideo.

**Withholding Payment**. If the Client has or may have engaged in an activity that is deceptive or fraudulent in nature, as determined by TargetVideo at its sole discretion, TargetVideo shall reserve the right to withhold payment from the Client. Such deceptive or fraudulent activities shall include, without limitation, clicks not referring to URLs, an extremely large number of repeated clicks, and clicks originating from unapproved root URLs. In addition, with respect to the Display Creatives, for any payment calculation, in no event shall more than 5% (five percent) of unique visitors originate from one IP address. Impressions that are sent (i. e. served) but not received due to the end-user’s blocking technology or software (e. g. pop-up-blocking software) shall not count towards any payment calculation.

**Policy Violations and Deductions**. In specific cases of an egregious violation of the terms of use, such as a large number of invalid clicks and impressions, or any activity that is not in compliance with Google’s or TargetVideo’s policies or that may cause considerable harm to TargetVideo’s network, TargetVideo shall not bear the costs of deductions and has the right to deduct the costs from future payments to the respective Client.

**Taxes.** TargetVideo does not assume any responsibility for paying income taxes on the Client’s behalf. By participating in TargetVideo’s ad program, the Client shall assume full and sole responsibility for any taxes owed as a consequence of such participation. Moreover, the Client agrees to indemnify and not to hold TargetVideo liable for any such taxes. If residing in the United States of America, the Client agrees to provide his/her Social Security Number or Federal Employer Identification Number and any other reasonable information to TargetVideo for tax-reporting purposes, and such information shall be used for no other purpose. If residing outside of the United States of America, the Client may be asked to complete appropriate forms for tax-reporting purposes. Moreover, the Client agrees to accurately complete such forms. In the event that the Client fails to provide accurate tax information or to complete any necessary tax-reporting forms, as determined at TargetVideo’s sole and absolute discretion, TargetVideo may withhold payment from the Client.

**Late Fees.** If any amount due hereunder could not be received by TargetVideo by the due date, such charges, at TargetVideo’s discretion, shall accrue late interest at a 12% (twelve percent) yearly rate or at the maximum rate permitted by law (should this rate be lower than the former), from the date such payment was due until the date on which the payment will be made in full. In addition, if TargetVideo does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder, prior to the expiration of such period, TargetVideo may temporarily deny the Client’s access to the Services, upon a 10 (ten) days’ written notice.

**Subscription Services**

* **Stripe Payment.** The Client understands and acknowledges that the TargetVideo may use “Stripe” for facilitating and managing payments for Subscription Services and therefore it is bound by the Stripe Payments Company Terms published on https://stripe.com/legal/spc and Stripe Services Agreement published on https://stripe.com/legal/ssa .
* **Auto-Renewal and Cancellation.** If the Client intends to purchase a subscription to TargetVideo, he/she can choose between a monthly or yearly subscription, both of which are billed in advance via credit card or PayPal and renewed automatically. The Client shall also have the option of a recurring monthly subscription, which is available for purchase via credit card and which can be renewed automatically.
* The Client agrees that TargetVideo, depending on the applicable billing cycle, may process his/her credit card or PayPal account on a monthly, annual or other regular basis, on the calendar day corresponding to the first day of the Client’s paid subscription. If that day does not exist in the subsequent month (e. g. there is no 30thFebruary), TargetVideo shall process the Client’s payment on the day which is the nearest in advance to the non-existing day (in the given example: on 28th of February).
* All credit card payments shall be processed in EUR currency. The amount for which the Client’s credit card account will be charged shall be obtained through converting the price from USD to EUR. The said amount shall be converted to the Client’s local currency according to the card association’s exchange rate. Differences resulting from this conversion are to the disadvantage of the Client.
* If not agreed otherwise between the parties, the Client can cancel his/her TargetVideo subscription at any time via his/her account, with 15 days previous written termination notice. TargetVideo reserves the right to cancel the Client’s subscription in case of a violation of these terms or for any other reasons.
* The Client shall cancel an ongoing subscription before the renewal date. Cancellations made after or on the renewal date shall take effect only for the next billing period.
* If the Client made payment to TargetVideo via a supported credit card, TargetVideo shall not save any data concerning such credit card.
* If the Client has an annual subscription, all subscription cancellations shall come into effect at the end of his/her current annual period.
* The Client hereby authorizes TargetVideo to charge all incurred fees and overages regarding the designated payment form, and acknowledges that periodic fees and overages may be charged automatically and without a separate authorisation. By choosing a recurring payment plan, the Client acknowledges that such Products or Editions shall have an initial and recurring payment feature. Moreover, the Client shall accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to the cancellation.

**Native Player Services and Premium Demand Services**  

**Providing the Video Technology and Video Content**

TargetVideo provides a player to the Client as a SaaS solution including access to the TargetVideo video library. The player is integrated into the Client’s website, e.g. in the form of an AdTag, using  code provided by TargetVideo.  The player can be used to deliver Video content, native video ads and automated ad clips which can all be played through the player. All of these services are hereinafter referred to as “Video Technology”. The Client can decide in advance if and which video content to integrate from the library.

**Client’s obligations**

The Client agrees to integrate the ad tags and codes provided by TargetVideo in order for the same to be fully operational and visible on its website. TargetVideo will check and verify that the integration and the tracking are operational. The Ad Tags provided may only be used on Client’s website. The Client also agrees not to integrate the Ad Tags in environments that primarily contain content glorifying violence, sexual content or political content, or that receives automated traffic (bots).

**Grant of Rights**

TargetVideo hereby grants the Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to use and reproduce the Video Technology and the videoclips on its Website for the term and in accordance with the service order and/or individual agreement concluded between TargetVideo and the Client.

The Client hereby accepts the rights granted in this clause. TargetVideo warrants that the Videos from its library, when used by the Client in accordance with the Service Order and/or individual agreement between TargetVideo and the Client, do not infringe the rights of any third party. The codes provided by TargetVideo may only be used on the Client website.

Unless otherwise agreed in the Service Order and/or individual agreement between TargetVideo and the Client, the provisions of the German Tenancy Act shall apply.

**Reclamation Policy.** 

If the Client is dissatisfied with the Services because of incorrectly calculated prices or other deficiencies, he/she can submit a reclamation request.

In the aforementioned scenario, the Client shall be obliged to submit a written reclamation request to TargetVideo via email (accounting@target-video.com[),](mailto:billling@brid.tv)  or to submit the said request orally to TargetVideo via telephone +49892154540 and point out the deficiency of the provided Service.

Upon receipt, the reclamation request shall be officially documented at once, and the Client shall receive a written confirmation of his/her reclamation request via email.

Upon receiving the said request, TargetVideo shall commence the process of internal control of the offered Services, and it shall deliver a detailed response within 15 (fifteen) days from the submission. TargetVideo’s response shall contain TargetVideo’s decision on whether it accepts the request, a statement on the reclamation request, as well as a definite suggestion and a deadline for the reclamation request’s resolution.
