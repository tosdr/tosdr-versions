Introduction
------------

BridTV (legally known as Brid Video, DOO) is a leading video player software and video management platform (collectively, the “**BridTV Technology**”). Our customers are businesses that use the BridTV Technology to host, embed, stream, and deliver advertising to, digital video over the web (collectively, “**BridTV Services**”).

BridTV has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from:

* Visitors to our website located at [www.brid.tv](https://www.brid.tv/) (the “**Corporate Website**”), including all subdomains,
* Users who watch our customers’ videos on websites, apps, mobile apps, and other software powered by BridTV Technology (each, a “**Customer Property**”) using a desktop or laptop PC, mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other devices, and
* Visitors to our other owned-and-operated websites (each, a “**BridTV Website**”), including [adiq.brid.tv](https://adiq.brid.tv/) and [developer.brid.tv,](https://developer.brid.tv/)
* Visitors to our white-labeled operated websites (each, a **"BridTV White Label Website**"), including cms.a-2.tv, player.a-2.tv, adhunters.tv and vidssp.com.

This Privacy Policy does _not_ describe the information collection practices of our customers that use BridTV Technology on their Customer Properties. We are a third-party service provider to our customers. We recommend that you refer to our customers’ privacy policies to learn about their information collection practices.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy.** BridTV will update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. We will post all Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. The Privacy Policy posted on this page will say when that version went into effect. If you visit the Corporate Website or view a video on a Customer Property after a change, then you will have accepted BridTV’s new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

A. Corporate Website at [www.brid.tv](https://www.brid.tv/)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. **INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE CORPORATE WEBSITE**

Our Corporate Website provides information about our company, business, and the services we provide. It is also the portal used by our customers to sign into the customer dashboard for BridTV Services.

The Corporate Website collects Personal Data, Usage Data, and Tracking Data when you visit the site at [www.brid.tv](https://www.brid.tv/). As used in our discussion about the Corporate Website in this Section A:

“**Personal Data**” is the information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual. If you access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we use a different definition of Personal Data to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

“**Tracking Data**” is the information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixel tags, web beacons, or scripts) that we use to keep track of visitor activity on the Corporate Website. (Note that the Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology is different, and is discussed in Section B.)

* **Cookies** are small files that contain a small amount of data, typically including a unique identifier. They are generally placed on your browser by a website or other browser-based service. Our Corporate Website uses cookies. Our player technology does not use any cookies.
* **Other tracking technologies**, in the context of the Corporate Website, include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used to track usage and performance. (See Section B below for the tracking technologies used by BridTV Technology.)

“**Usage Data,**” in the context of the Corporate Website, is the information that your browser sends to BridTV servers when you visit the Corporate Website.

As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time your browser or device interacts with the Corporate Website, and store that information in “log files.” The information stored in our web servers’ log files includes information that we call Personal Data, Usage Data and Tracking Data, and that we describe more fully in the following sections.

For visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – such as a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

BridTV uses third-party advertising companies to advertise BridTV and BridTV Services. We allow these service providers to use their tracking technologies on the Corporate Website so that we can target ads about BridTV to you when you are elsewhere on the Internet. This process is sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. If you want more information about these third-party advertising companies, or if you wish to opt out of this type of advertising, please visit the ad industry choice mechanism at [www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

6. **TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.** As BridTV works with global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. This may be intra-group or to third parties that we work with who are likely located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

**Note for visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:** If we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we will take steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data.

B. BridTV Technology (BridTV Player and Online Platform)
--------------------------------------------------------

1. **INFORMATION COLLECTED BY BRIDTV TECHNOLOGY ABOUT USERS**

Our customers are primarily web publishers (each, a “**Customer**”) that deploy BridTV Technology on their Customer Properties to provide their visitors (each, a “**User**”) with a high-quality video viewing experience.

In Section B, we describe the information that is collected from Users who view videos and ads on a Customer Property. BridTV Technology collects **Usage Data** and **Tracking Data** from Users. Note that the Tracking Technologies used in BridTV Technology are different from the Tracking Technologies used on the Corporate Website.

2. **ABOUT USAGE DATA AND TRACKING DATA**

* Usage Data and Tracking Data Collected by the BridTV Technology. BridTV Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data from a User when he or she views video on a Customer Property. As used in our discussion about the BridTV Technology in this Section B:

* “Usage Data” is the information that a User’s browser automatically sends to BridTV’s servers when a User accesses video or sees an ad on a Customer Property. This information includes a User’s device type, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.

* “Tracking Data” is the information collected by BridTV Technology from Users who access videos on a Customer Property, and consists primarily of other tracking technologies include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used for ad delivery and reporting.

* The Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology include:

* Information collected through tracking technologies.
* Platform type and version.
* User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address.
* Unique identifiers set by our tracking technologies to identify video players.

* **Personal Data.** As previously noted, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – for example, a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by BridTV Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK. We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of BridTV Services or BridTV Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.
* **Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.** For Users who access the BridTV Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR. The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “**data controllers**”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “**data processors**”). When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with BridTV Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data. If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which BridTV Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.
* With that in mind, if you have concerns about BridTV, you may contact us, at contact@brid.tv.

  

* How We May Use Usage Data and Tracking Data. We use Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology for the following purposes:

* Deliver video to Customer Properties, and ads on behalf of advertisers.
* Recommend videos that a User may enjoy.
* Prepare reports and analytics for our customers.
* For our other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, diagnosing technical problems, operating, maintaining, enhancing and improving BridTV Technology and the BridTV Service, and developing new products and services.
* As we believe appropriate for Compliance Purposes.

  

* When We May Disclose Usage and Tracking Data. We may disclose Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology for the following purposes:

* **Service Providers.** To third-party service providers who provide services such as hosting, data analysis, IT infrastructure, IT services, customer service, auditing, security, fraud, and other similar functions to us or our Customers. These third parties have access to User Usage and Tracking Data to perform these tasks on our behalf.
* **Transfer of Business.** To a third party to which we have transferred our business, assets or stock in the event that BridTV is involved in a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of some or all of our business, assets or stock, including during due diligence related to any such transaction (and also including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding).
* As we believe appropriate for Compliance Purposes.

  

* To protect an individual user account from accidental deletion, BridTV maintains the deleted data in the system for 30 days. During the retention period, you can restore your account to its state at the time it was deleted. After the retention period has expired, the account and its data is permanently deleted.

  

3. **USER CHOICES FOR BRIDTV TECHNOLOGY**

* For Users who access BridTV Technology from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK: The Do Not Track Browser Setting. Certain versions of BridTV Technology support Do Not Track for Users in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Do Not Track is a preference Users can set in their web browser to inform websites that they do not want to be tracked. Users can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of their web browser. We make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers. However, you should be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts, there may be circumstances in which a particular Do Not Track setting is not recognized and honored.

* Note that even if a User enables and BridTV recognizes Do Not Track, BridTV Technology will continue to collect Usage Data about each visit to a Customer Property, because Usage Data are automatically sent by the User’s web browser. However, the Usage Data will not be associated with any unique identifier, and BridTV Technology will not be able to associate such User Data collected with User.

  

* Check Our Customers’ Privacy Policy. Users interact with BridTV Technology, because our Customers have implemented BridTV Technology in their Customer Properties. We recommend that Users check the privacy policy of the Customer Properties that they visit for information about the user choices available from our Customers. Many Customer Properties use third-party advertising companies for interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. If you want more information about these third-party advertising companies, please visit the ad industry choice mechanism at [www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

4. **FOR USERS WHO ACCESS BRIDTV TECHNOLOGY FROM THE EEA, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UK: TRANSFER OF INFORMATION.** See Section A.6 for information regarding those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Information under the GDPR.
5. **SERVICE PROVIDERS.** We work with third parties that provide services and functionality for BridTV Technology. These service providers may have access to Usage Data and Tracking Data of BridTV Technology in order to perform tasks on our behalf. Occasionally, we may give our service providers explicit permission to use the Usage Data or Tracking Data to enhance the fraud-detection, security, or other features of their services.

At our Customers’ instruction, we work with the service providers of our Customers. We may provide Usage Data and Tracking Data collected on a Customer Property to that Customer’s service providers.
