For each Transaction made via an AdMedia generated in advanced suite, the Publisher is allocated a corresponding commission. The commission can vary depending on the AdMedia and Advertiser. 

The recording of the Publisher's services subject to remuneration and the processing of payments shall be carried out via the advanced store platform. Commissions earned and released by the Publisher are credited to an internal account managed by advanced store for the Publisher.

The commission is released if the Transaction is successfully carried out via advanced suite AdMedia, is validated and is not subsequently cancelled. Cancellation may occur due to any termination of the contractual relationship underlying the Transaction, e.g. revocation, rescission, avoidance or other rights or actions. The commission is automatically released (validated) if it is not cancelled within 60 days.
