These Terms and the Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) available at [https://reasonlabs.com/platform/products/rav/privacy-policy](https://reasonlabs.com/platform/products/rav/privacy-policy), which is incorporated herein by reference, govern your access to and use of the Services. These Terms also govern any software updates and/or upgrades provided by us as part of the Services, unless such updates and/or upgrades are accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms and conditions of such separate license will apply.

BY ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING AND/OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. By accepting these Terms, you confirm that you are: (i) lawfully entitled to use the Software and/or Website in the country in which you are located, and (ii) of legal age to engage in this binding agreement with us. If you are a minor according to the law of the country you reside in, you are not permitted to use the Services. If you do not accept these Terms, then you may not access, download, install or use the Services (as applicable).

We reserve the right, without prior notice and at our sole discretion, to change, modify and/or update these Terms at any time, and/or modify, change, or discontinue or cancel any feature of the Services. In case that we update these Terms, then we will post the updated Terms on the Website, and if the update is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you with notice via email or ask for your consent. We recommend you to check these Terms from time to time for changes. Your continued use of the Services following any changes to these Terms or the Services, constitutes your irrevocable acceptance of all such changes. If you do not accept any modification to the Services and/or these Terms, your only recourse is to cease using the Website and/or uninstall the Software.

1\. License.
------------

Subject to your compliance with the terms of these Terms, you are hereby granted with a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, license to use the website available at: [https://reasonlabs.com/](https://reasonlabs.com/) (the “Website”), and to download and install one copy of one or more of our RAV Software editions that accompany these Terms (the “Software”, and together with the Website, the “Services”) on a personal computer, or other compatible device you own. The license to the Software is granted to you for personal use and not for commercial use.

We offer 2 editions to the Software:

Our Essential Edition can be used free of charge for an unlimited time period and includes scan, remove and real-time protection (the **“Essential Edition”**); Our Premium Edition is a paid software, valid for a period of your choice (the details on the current prices and subscription plans are available on the Website) and includes the following solutions (the **“Premium Edition”**): Anti-Virus & Anti-Malware Scan, Real-Time Protection, Threat Removal, Anti Ransomware capabilities and additional premium solutions. You may transfer the license to the Software granted to you hereunder to a different device you own if you uninstall and remove the Software from the original device. For avoidance of doubt, you must have a valid license to one of our editions to the Software for each device you wish to operate the Software on. All rights not expressly granted to you hereunder are retained by us.

Please note that our Anti Ransomware feature deploys honeypot files on your computer in order to attract potential cyberattacks. The honeypots allow us to stop the attack immediately after detecting that the ransomware attempted to modify the honeypot files.

Except as expressly provided herein, you may not, and may not permit any third party to: (i) use and/or disclose to any third party for any reason any license number, or other authorization code or number supplied by us in connection with the Software on or for more than the number of devices specified by us; (ii) copy, change, modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, reconstruct, transform, create derivative works based on the Services, extract any part of or otherwise alter the Services (iii) share, transfer, publish, resell, broadcast, transmit, communicate, pledge, sublicense the Software, or permit other individuals/entities to use the Software, rent, lease, distribute or transfer the Software or your rights to use it to any other individual or entity; (iv) make the functionality of the Software available to any individual or entity through any means, including but not limited to uploading the Software to a network or file-sharing service, software-as-a-service (SaaS), or any other type of services; (v) extract or harvest any information from the Services or any part thereof; (vi) delete or modify any attributions, trademarks, copyright, legal notices or other proprietary designations or markings which are part of the Services; (vii) use the Services in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with the terms and conditions of these Terms; (ix) gain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or to networks connected to it by any means, including without limitation by hacking, spoofing or circumventing the Services or the security features therein; (x) use or attempt to use the Software by itself, or in conjunction with any other products, or upload, store or transmit any data, information or materials which infringe upon any third party’s rights, including without limitation third party’s intellectual property rights or any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory or otherwise objectionable or to invade user’s privacy in any way, or to track, store, transmit or record personal information about any other user of the Software; or otherwise in any way damage, disable, impair, interfere, disrupt or harm us or the Services in any way; (xi) use the Services to provide or build a product or service that competes with the Software; (xii) test or benchmark, or disclose or publish testing or benchmark results, for the Software without our prior written consent.
