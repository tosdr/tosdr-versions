**The Money Isn't In the List... It's In The Products That You Sell To Your Email List**

**First, there's no money in the list.** There is only money in the products that you promote, just like the retailer down the street. They are not being paid by simply being open and having customers walk in the door... No, no, no! It's ALL about the products they sell that make the money.

  

If you are just an affiliate "making money" by wasting money on advertising and getting very little ROI than you have to learn this one secret today.. or your business might be gone tomorrow.
