You further agree that your obligations as guarantor and as indemnitor are those of a primary obligor and that they exist irrespective of any total or partial invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement.

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to access and use the Services, subject to, and in accordance with, this Agreement.

You must have a HUAWEI ID to access or use the Services. For more details about HUAWEI ID, access your HUAWEI ID from system Settings, then go to Settings \> About \> HUAWEI ID User Agreement.

5\. The Services

Petal Search is a search engine that enables you to search for web pages, pictures, videos, news, and other content on the Internet. Petal Search is available on Huawei devices as an app or as a search box embedded in Huawei services, such as HUAWEI Assistant, and is also accessible as a website.

6\. Third\-Party Services

By using third-party apps and services via the Services, you acknowledge that you will be entering into a contract with the third-party developers (hereinafter referred to as the "Developer") for the provision of apps, and that you will be subject to the service agreement and/or end user license agreement ("EULA") stipulated by the Developer. Huawei is not a party to the EULA between you and the Developer. We strongly recommend that you read the content of Developer's service agreements, EULAs, and privacy policies carefully. Huawei is neither entitled to nor obliged to control or censor the content of Developer apps and services, and therefore shall assume no liability in the event that your rights are infringed due to your use thereof.

Huawei is not responsible for the content or availability of any Developer apps or services and does not endorse and is not responsible in any way for any content, advertising, products, services or other materials made available by Developers. In the event that you do not observe this Agreement or Developer EULAs, agreements, and/or privacy policies, the Developer may take action against you, and Huawei may be required to assist the Developer and/or relevant government authorities. You will bear full legal responsibility in such events and indemnify and hold harmless Huawei in respect of any losses, damages or claim against us.

Any dispute caused by the downloading, licensing, and/or use of Developer apps shall be settled by the Developer. Huawei assumes no responsibility therefor. Huawei does not provide any customer support for third-party software or technology. If you require support, please contact the Developer.

Each Developer takes full responsibility for their apps, app content, and any guarantees they make. Where a dispute arises, the developer's warranty, or any other applicable terms of the EULA or other agreement agreed between you and the Developer concerning the app in question, shall prevail over this Agreement.

7\. Account Security

You must keep your HUAWEI ID username and password secret and confidential, and you must not share them with anyone else. We recommend that you choose a strong password and store it in a safe place. You are responsible for keeping your password safe and you agree that we shall not be liable for any losses, damages, liabilities, or claims of any sort as a result of you providing your HUAWEI ID details to a third party.

If you think that someone else might be using your account information, you must let us know immediately using the contact information provided in the "Contacting Us" section. You must not use anyone else's HUAWEI ID to access the Services. You must take appropriate steps to protect your HUAWEI ID account information and transaction information to prevent unauthorized use by third parties.
