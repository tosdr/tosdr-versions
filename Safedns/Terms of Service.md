1Using our Services
-------------------

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.  
Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services. Our Services display some content that is not SafeDNS’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do. In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

2Privacy and Copyright Protection
---------------------------------

SafeDNS’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that SafeDNS can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policies. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  
  
By using our Services, you grant to SafeDNS a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide rights to use all your intellectual property, including but limited to your name; your trademarks; your photographic and other works depicting goods marked with your trademark, etc.  
  
The purposes and/or ways of using the above rights are:  
  
a) to publish successful cases of cooperation between you and SafeDNS (what problem SafeDNS solved; what results you achieved; what solutions you had considered; why you picked SafeDNS);  
  
b) publication of information for advertising and informational purposes, including by the creation of advertising and informational materials, distributed on television, in mobile applications, on the Internet and in other ways not prohibited by law.  
  
By using our Services, you confirm that SafeDNS has no need to mention or specify in any ways you as the author or the owner of the intellectual property that has been granted to use by SafeDNS by these provisions.  
At any time, you may by written revoke your consent to grant such a right to use your intellectual property by SafeDNS.

3Your Content in our Services
-----------------------------

Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.  
When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give SafeDNS (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.  
You can find more information about how SafeDNS uses and stores content in the Privacy Policy. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

4About Software in our Services
-------------------------------

When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.  
SafeDNS gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by SafeDNS as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by SafeDNS, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission. Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.

---------------------------------------

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.  
You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. SafeDNS may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.  
We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such datais important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.

6Our Warranties and Disclaimers
