Advertiser disclosure

### You’re our first priority.  
Every time.

We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesn’t feature every company or financial product available on the market, we’re proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward — and free.

So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. [Here is a list of our partners](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/our-partners/).

You may apply for the NerdUp Card through the NerdWallet Mobile App or on the NerdWallet Website. During the application process and periodically thereafter, you will be presented with certain agreements, disclosures, notices, and other information (“Bank Documents”) governing your relationship with the Bank as it pertains to the card, account, and related services described in the Bank Documents (“Bank Services”). Bank is the financial institution that provides the Bank Services. NerdWallet facilitates the delivery of Bank Services by obtaining, processing, and sharing your information and transaction instructions with Bank, but NerdWallet does not hold or transfer your money or extend credit to you. NerdWallet may offer its own services, or the services of other third-parties, that are separate from the Bank Services described in the Bank Documents (“Non-Bank Services”). Bank is not responsible or liable for the Non-Bank Services, even if the Non-Bank Services are financial in nature and seem related to the Bank Services.

The financial planning services are designed to help Clients begin to assess their financial situation by looking at such things as budgeting, debt management, saving, retirement, insurance, and short- and long-term financial goals. Financial planning services are provided through consultations with NerdWallet Advisory investment adviser representatives that generally are also licensed as a Certified Financial Planner™. In order to enroll in financial planning services, Clients enter into a separate client agreement with NerdWallet Advisory that governs the advisory relationship (“Client Agreement”). In the event of a conflict between the Client Agreement and these Terms, the Client Agreement will control for the financial planning services provided by NerdWallet Advisory. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms do not govern the financial planning services provided by NerdWallet Advisory, and nothing in these Terms is intended to waive or limit NerdWallet Advisory’s fiduciary duty or any rights Clients may have under federal or state securities laws.

ii) NerdWallet Advisory also offers an automated financial plan service called “NerdWallet Coach powered by Uprise” through third-party provider Ontrail, Inc. (dba Uprise). In order to enroll in the NerdWallet Coach product powered by Uprise, Clients enter into a separate agreement with Uprise. These Terms govern your relationship with NerdWallet Advisory.

iii) NerdWallet Advisory offers a product called NerdWallet Advisors Match that allows you to complete an online questionnaire about your financial needs and match with a third-party financial advisor that has elected to participate in our matching platform based on information gathered from users through the online questionnaire. NerdWallet Advisory receives compensation from advisers for our matching and referral services. NerdWallet Advisory does not review the ongoing performance of any adviser, participate in the management of any user’s account by the adviser, or provide advice regarding specific investments. The NerdWallet Advisory Match product helps users connect with relevant financial advisors. If you choose to engage the financial advisory, you will need to enter into a separate agreement with the advisor that governs your relationship with them. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms govern your relationship with NerdWallet Advisory when you use NerdWallet Advisory Match.

11. Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), without regard to conflict of law principles. Subject to Section 12, which provides that disputes are to be resolved through binding arbitration or small claims court, to the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and NerdWallet agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California, for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

12. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver. MOST DISPUTES AND CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO YOUR SATISFACTION BY CONTACTING US AT [\[email protected\]](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). HOWEVER, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT NERDWALLET CANNOT RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH YOU, THEN, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO SMALL COURT CLAIMS AND CLAIMS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS SET FORTH IN THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” SECTION BELOW (“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”), BOTH YOU AND NERDWALLET AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION UNDER ITS CONSUMER AND/OR COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OR, BY SEPARATE MUTUAL AGREEMENT, TO ANOTHER ARBITRATION INSTITUTION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” SECTION BELOW.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND NERDWALLET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

A) CLAIMS TO BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW NERDWALLET AND YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND NERDWALLET, AND BETWEEN YOU AND OUR FORMER OR PAST EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CONTRACTORS, IN ALL CASES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, EXCEPT THAT: (1) EACH PARTY MAY COMMENCE AN ACTION IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION FOR INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AS CONTEMPLATED IN SECTION 12(H) BELOW (INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) PENDING A FINAL DECISION BY THE ARBITRATOR, (2) EITHER PARTY MAY BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THE RULES OF THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT WILL ALLOW IT. IF EITHER PARTY DOES NOT BRING ITS CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (OR IF YOU OR WE APPEAL A SMALL CLAIMS COURT JUDGMENT TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION), THEN THE CLAIMS MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.

YOU AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, YOU AND NERDWALLET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THE TERMS EVIDENCE A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE, AND THUS THE FAA GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THE TERMS OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NERDWALLET FOR ANY REASON.

B) ARBITRATOR. ANY ARBITRATION BETWEEN YOU AND NERDWALLET WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (COLLECTIVELY, “AAA RULES”) OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”), AS MODIFIED BY THESE TERMS, AND WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AAA. THE AAA RULES AND FILING FORMS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE AT WWW.ADR.ORG, BY CALLING THE AAA AT 1-800-778-7879, OR BY CONTACTING NERDWALLET. 

ALL ISSUES ARE FOR THE ARBITRATOR TO DECIDE, INCLUDING THE SCOPE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AS WELL AS OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE RELATING TO THE SCOPE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION OR ANY OTHER TERM OF THESE TERMS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIM THAT ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION OR THESE TERMS IS VOID OR VOIDABLE. HOWEVER IF PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ARE INITIALLY BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY IN A COURT OF LAW, AND A MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION IS BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY, THEN THE COURT SHALL DECIDE WHETHER THESE TERMS PERMIT CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE COURT AND ARBITRATOR SHALL BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING WITH REGARD TO THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION BELOW. IN ANY ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL FOLLOW THE APPLICABLE LAW. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO COMMIT MANIFEST ERRORS OF LAW OR LEGAL REASONING, AND ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR THAT EMPLOYS A MANIFEST ERROR OF LAW OR LEGAL REASONING MAY BE VACATED OR CORRECTED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION FOR ANY SUCH ERROR.

DURING THE ARBITRATION, THE AMOUNT OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MADE BY NERDWALLET OR YOU SHALL NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL AFTER THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, TO WHICH YOU OR NERDWALLET ARE ENTITLED. IN ARBITRATION, AND TO THE EXTENT OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES MAY EXCHANGE “OFFERS OF COMPROMISE” OR STIPULATE TO JUDGMENTS OR AWARDS IN THE SAME WAY THE PARTIES COULD IN COURT, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 998 FOR ARBITRATIONS TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. SUCH OFFERS OF COMPROMISE SHALL HAVE THE SAME FORCE AND EFFECT AS THEY WOULD IN A COURT PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL OTHERWISE REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL, EXCEPT FOR PURPOSES OF SEEKING COURT INTERVENTION (IF NECESSARY).

C) NOTICE AND PROCESS. A PARTY WHO INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION MUST FIRST SEND TO THE OTHER, BY CERTIFIED MAIL, A WRITTEN NOTICE OF DISPUTE (“NOTICE”). THE NOTICE TO NERDWALLET SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO: NERDWALLET, INC., 55 HAWTHORNE ST, 10TH FLOOR, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94105 (“NOTICE ADDRESS”) AND MUST BE SIGNED BY YOU PERSONALLY. NOTICE TO YOU FROM NERDWALLET MAY BE TO YOU DIRECTLY, OR IF YOU ARE REPRESENTED, TO YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL. THE NOTICE MUST (A) DESCRIBE THE NATURE AND BASIS OF THE CLAIM OR DISPUTE; AND (B) SET FORTH THE SPECIFIC RELIEF SOUGHT (“DEMAND”). IF YOU AND NERDWALLET DO NOT REACH AN AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE NOTICE IS RECEIVED, YOU OR NERDWALLET MAY COMMENCE AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

D) FEES. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU COMMENCE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS, NERDWALLET WILL, AT YOUR REQUEST, REIMBURSE YOU FOR YOUR PAYMENT OF THE ARBITRATION FILING FEE, UNLESS YOUR CLAIM IS FOR GREATER THAN $10,000, IN WHICH CASE THE PAYMENT OF ANY FEES SHALL BE DECIDED BY THE AAA RULES. ANY REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF FEES BY NERDWALLET SHOULD BE SUBMITTED BY MAIL TO THE AAA ALONG WITH YOUR DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION AND NERDWALLET WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO PAY ALL NECESSARY FEES DIRECTLY TO THE AAA. IN THE EVENT THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THE CLAIM(S) YOU ASSERT IN THE ARBITRATION TO BE FRIVOLOUS OR BROUGHT FOR AN IMPROPER PURPOSE (AS MEASURED BY THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 11(B) OR ITS SUCCESSOR RULE), YOU AGREE TO REIMBURSE NERDWALLET FOR ALL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARBITRATION PAID BY NERDWALLET ON YOUR BEHALF THAT YOU OTHERWISE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY UNDER THE AAA’S RULES.

IF YOUR CLAIM IS FOR $10,000 OR LESS, YOU MAY CHOOSE WHETHER THE ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, THROUGH A NON-APPEARANCE BASED TELEPHONIC HEARING, OR BY AN IN-PERSON HEARING AS ESTABLISHED BY THE AAA RULES. ANY IN-PERSON ARBITRATION HEARINGS WILL TAKE PLACE AT A LOCATION TO BE AGREED UPON IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. REGARDLESS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ARBITRATION IS CONDUCTED, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ISSUE A REASONED WRITTEN DECISION SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE ESSENTIAL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS ON WHICH THE DECISION AND AWARD, IF ANY, ARE BASED. THE ARBITRATOR MAY MAKE RULINGS AND RESOLVE DISPUTES AS TO THE PAYMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT OF FEES OR EXPENSES AT ANY TIME DURING THE PROCEEDING AND UPON REQUEST FROM EITHER PARTY MADE WITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ARBITRATOR’S RULING ON THE MERITS.

E) CLASS ACTION WAIVER. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND NERDWALLET AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS (EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION (F) BELOW), AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. IF THIS SPECIFIC SUBPARAGRAPH (E) IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE IN ITS ENTIRETY, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. HOWEVER, IF ONLY A PORTION OF THIS SUBPARAGRAPH (E) IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE UNENFORCEABLE PORTION OF THE PROVISION SHALL BE STRICKEN, AND THE REMAINDER OF SUBPARAGRAPH (E) ENFORCED. ANY CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION SEEKING RELIEF NOT SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER APPLICABLE LAW SHALL BE STAYED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION PENDING COMPLETION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. NOTHING IN SUBSECTION (E) OR (F) BELOW SHALL PREVENT YOU OR NERDWALLET FROM PARTICIPATING IN A CLASSWIDE SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS.

YOU AND NERDWALLET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

F) MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR BATCH ARBITRATION. YOU AND NERDWALLET AGREE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF ANY MASS, COLLECTIVE OR BATCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBSECTION (F). You and NerdWallet agree that a “mass, collective, and/or batch arbitration” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you and others are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms or legal counsel that has filed more than 150 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against NerdWallet, alleging similar or identical claims or causes of action, within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on your or others behalf, and the law firm or collective of legal counsel/law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands together. If more than 150 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature, alleging the similar or identical claims or causes of action, are filed against NerdWallet by the same law firm or collection of legal counsel/law firms within 180 days of one another, each arbitration demand must be filed, administered, arbitrated, and resolved pursuant to this subsection (f).

Specifically, in order to increase the efficiency of resolution for any mass, collective, and/or batch arbitration, in the event 150 or more similar arbitration demands against NerdWallet are filed within a 180 day period pursuant to the above, the arbitration provider shall (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 150 demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. You and NerdWallet agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the aforementioned protocol for mass, collective, and/or batch arbitrations with regard to resolution, fees and administration. If subsections (f)(i) or (f)(ii) are not enforced, or the arbitration provider refuses to follow these specific mass, collective, and/or batch arbitration protocols, then each arbitration demand must be filed, administered, arbitrated, and resolved individually, or the parties agree to seek out a different, mutually agreeable and widely-recognized arbitration organization agreeable to follow subsections (f)(i) or (f)(ii). If any other portion of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (f) and this agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. Mass, collective, and/or batch arbitrations shall otherwise be subject to all other substantive and procedural terms contained within this agreement.

g) Discovery. Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.

h) Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the Arbitration Agreement, you acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate remedy for unauthorized access to or use of the Services or your breach of any provisions in the Terms relating to NerdWallet’s intellectual property rights, and any such breach would result in irreparable harm to NerdWallet. Accordingly, in the event of any such actual or threatened breach, NerdWallet may, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to NerdWallet at law or equity, seek specific performance or injunctive relief without the posting of a bond.

i) Modifications. If NerdWallet makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in a service or program or your use of the Services, you may reject any such change and require NerdWallet to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase if a dispute between us arises, by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event you reject any future change, your account with NerdWallet shall be immediately terminated and you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase.

j) Severability and Enforceability. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 12 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 12 shall still apply. If the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, then the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 11 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms, and that the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.

13\. Modification of the Services. NerdWallet reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, some or all of the Services at any time without any notice or further obligation to you. You agree that NerdWallet will not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services.

14\. General.

a) Entire Agreement. Except as specified herein, these Terms, together with the [Privacy Policy](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/privacy-policy/), constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and NerdWallet regarding your use of and access to the Services, and except as expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties.

b) No Waiver. The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of the Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

c) Paragraph Headers. Use of paragraph headers in the Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions.

d) Severability. In the event that any part of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

e) Partner Terms. In some instances, NerdWallet’s third-party partners require that NerdWallet users agree to be bound by some additional terms of use that are specific to particular products or services (“Partner Terms”). In the event of any conflict between the Partner Terms and NerdWallet’s Terms, NerdWallet’s Terms govern and control.

f) Third-Party Beneficiaries. NerdWallet’s former and past employees, directors, officers and contractors, and each of their successors and assigns, are intended beneficiaries of Section 6 (Indemnification) and the Arbitration Agreement and have the right to enforce such provisions against you. The Terms are not otherwise intended to grant rights to anyone except you and NerdWallet or create any third-party beneficiary rights.

15\. Notice to California Residents. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N. Market Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service.
