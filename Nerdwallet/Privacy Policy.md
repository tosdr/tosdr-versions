NerdWallet Privacy Policy
=========================

You deserve clarity and choice regarding our use of your personal data.

![](https://assets.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2024-01-07-at-12.52.50-PM.png)

Effective date: March 1, 2024

Introduction and Overview

At NerdWallet, our mission is to provide you with clarity for all of your life’s financial decisions. We do so by empowering you with financial information and guidance you can trust and by providing you with tools to help you make the best decisions for your financial needs.

When you use our websites and applications and input your personal information, we have an obligation to provide you with clarity regarding how your data is accessed and used by NerdWallet, its affiliates, vendors, partners and other third-party entities.

To that end, this Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you, how we collect it, how we use your information, whom we share your information with, and the steps we take to protect your information.

What This Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices related to your access and use of NerdWallet Services and the NerdWallet Platform.

* NerdWallet Services. When we say “NerdWallet Services” or “Services,” this means the products and services that are made available and directly provided by NerdWallet, Inc. or its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Fundera, Inc. and NerdWallet Advisory, Inc. through our websites and mobile applications. This includes, for example, our lending, credit, financial planning, and insurance products and services.
    
* NerdWallet Platform. When we say “NerdWallet Platform” or “Platform,” this means the products and services that are made available by our unaffiliated third-party partners under a co-branded arrangement where we share your information and/or receive your information from these partners with your consent. This includes, for example, when you sign up for the NerdUp credit card, tax preparation services, investing services, and vehicle selling services. When we share your information with our unaffiliated third-party partners, their privacy policy may apply.
    

Please note NerdWallet is a financial institution and most of our data collection, use, and sharing practices are governed by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. You can review our [Gramm-Leach-Bliley Privacy Notice](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/do-with-information/) for a summary of privacy options related to most of NerdWallet Platform and Services. By using and accessing the NerdWallet Platform and Services, you are consenting to receive notices about your financial privacy electronically.

We encourage you to read the entire Privacy Policy. By becoming a NerdWallet member or using the NerdWallet Platform and Services, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Privacy Policy. Your use of the NerdWallet Platform and Services is subject to the [NerdWallet Terms of Use](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/terms-of-use/) (the “Terms”). We use the same terms here as in Terms. We will let you know in this Privacy Policy if we have a new or different definition of a term.

Information We Collect

When we say “Personal Information,” we use this as a general term to mean information that can be any information about an individual from which that person can be reasonably identified.

Information we collect directly from you

We may collect Personal Information directly from you when you use the NerdWallet Platform and Services — for example, when you register to become a member, request to prequalify for a third-party credit card or loan product, request your TransUnion credit report and/or score, link your third-party financial accounts, or fill out calculators, forms or other fields.

Here are the types of Personal Information we may collect:

* Contact and registration information. Information you provide when you sign up to become a member, activate a subscription or upload information into the NerdWallet Platform or Service including your name, title and honorifics, email address, mailing address, phone number, date of birth, username and password. 
    
* Identity information. Information to verify your identity including your name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number or other government issued identification, or similar information. 
    
* Vehicle information. Information you provide when you are interested in an auto loan, are interested in selling your vehicle, or are interested in similar services, including your vehicle registration information and vehicle identification number.
    
* Financial information. Financial information, such as your payment information (credit card information), investments, income, expenses, assets, liabilities, financial goals, investing risk tolerance or other similar types of information about your job or business. We also may collect third-party financial account information, such as an ID and password. 
    
* Demographic information. Information including your age, gender, or other similar demographic information when such information is relevant to a particular financial product or service you have requested (for example, when requesting auto insurance rates or using retirement planning calculators). 
    
* User-generated content information. When you communicate with us, either by email, phone, or other means of communication, we also may collect the content of these communications, including but not limited to recordings of phone calls where permitted by law.
    
* Device and contact data. Depending on the permissions you grant in your device settings, we may get access to certain device-related information (e.g., device information, device identifiers).
    
* Inferences about customer preferences and characteristics. We may infer from information provided by you, information collected directly from your browser or device, or from information obtained from third-party marketing database partners.
    

We do not store your third-party financial account ID or passwords. Instead, we securely pass this information to our third-party partners when you request services that require us to confirm your identity, when you request to prequalify for their products, and/or to provide you with access to your financial information on the NerdWallet Platform or Services.

Information collected from third-parties

When you use NerdWallet Platform or Services, we may also obtain information about you from unaffiliated third-parties, such as our business partners, referral partners or advertisers when you authorize these parties to do so. The information we collect depends on the type of third-party and what you authorize them to share with us. For example, we collect Personal Information from:

* Banking institutions. When you apply for and are approved for a NerdUp by NerdWallet credit card, the credit card issuing bank, Evolve Bank & Trust (the “Bank”), may share your transaction history, current balances, payment history and other card related information with NerdWallet. If you use Bank Services, as defined in the [Terms](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/terms-of-use/), we may also receive information about your banking activity, including your account balances, and other financial transactional data from the Bank. You hereby consent to NerdWallet processing your information disclosed by the Bank in connection with “Non-Bank Services” (as described in the Terms) in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In all other instances, the Bank’s privacy policy controls over this Privacy Policy, but only with respect to information collected, obtained, or created in connection with the Bank Services. For more information on how the Bank uses your information, please review its privacy policy at [https://www.getevolved.com/privacy-policy/](https://www.getevolved.com/privacy-policy/). 
    
* Consumer reporting agencies and other third-parties. We may also, at your direction, receive credit reports or scores from consumer reporting agencies such as TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax, or from third-party services that provide a mechanism to share information you have provided to the third-party through the use of an application program interface (API), such as Facebook Connect or the Twitter API.
    
* Tax partners. If you use our tax offering, which is powered by Gamma Labs, Inc. dba Column Tax, we may receive some information about your tax filing, including your tax return status, the jurisdictions in which you filed taxes, your state of residence, and the amount you owe in taxes or are due in refund. For more information on how Column Tax uses your information, please review its privacy policy at [https://www.columntax.com/privacy-policy](https://www.columntax.com/privacy-policy).  
    
* Financial account linking partners. NerdWallet offers financial account linking that allows you to track all of your third-party financial accounts on NerdWallet’s website. By using the Link My Account Service, you grant NerdWallet permission to access your third-party financial accounts designated by you. We use your account information to evaluate your eligibility for and recommend other products or services and to modify or develop our products and services to better serve you. Plaid Inc. facilitates the Link My Account feature and for more information on how Plaid Inc. uses your information, please review its privacy policy at [https://plaid.com/legal/#consumers](https://plaid.com/legal/%23consumers).  
    
* Identify verification partners.  We work with third-party partners to help us verify your identity and supplement the Personal Information you provide to ensure the accuracy of the information.  For example, the third-party partners may verify your contact information or provide additional details about your address.  
    
* Social media and content providers. If you log onto your NerdWallet account through a social media site, we have access to certain information from that site, including your name, account information, profile photo. If you interact with content on our social media profiles (for example, if you “like” or share a blog or article from our website on Facebook, Instagram or other social media sites), those sites may share information about you with us depending on your privacy settings on those sites. Additionally, if you post information on a social media platform or another third-party service that references the NerdWallet Platform or Services, we may publish your post on our social media accounts or websites. To learn more about the privacy practices of the social media sites, please review the privacy notice of that site. 
    
* Public information. We may collect Personal Information about you from publicly available sources, such as open government databases, real property recorder records, assessor records, and social media platforms (as explained above) and others. 
    
* Data from other information providers. We may collect your demographic and household information, financial and assets-related information, employment history, credit card usage information, survey responses, and other information about products or services you may be interested in, including potential retail purchases of different types of products or services (e.g. “health & beauty products,” “clothing,” “electronics”), from other information providers known as data brokers. To learn more about the privacy practices of this information provider, please review its privacy policy at [https://www.acxiom.com/privacy/us/](https://www.acxiom.com/privacy/us/).
    

When we combine or associate information from other sources with your Personal Information that we collect through the NerdWallet Platform or Services, we will treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms, and applicable law.

They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

Where information collected through web beacons, buttons, and similar technologies is collected directly by third-parties, their collection and use of information is subject to that third-party’s own privacy policies. Some of these third-parties are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance and participate in the industry’s opt out, available at [http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/](http://optout.aboutads.info/%23!/) or at [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/%23!/).
