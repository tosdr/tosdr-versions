### Data Collected by Softland

While using our Website, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Below is a detailed list of the information we collect and how we use it.

**Placing an order**  
When you place an order from our Website, it is processed by one of the third party payment processors we use: Paypro Global or 2 Checkout/Avangate. They collect personally identifiable information such as your full name, company, email address, phone number, physical address, IP address, payment method and credit card information, to be able to process your payment and issue an invoice.

* [Fastspring's Privacy Policy](https://fastspring.com/privacy/)

None of the payment processors send the payment details to us, we do not receive or record any payment details. We receive the following information from the payment processors: full name, company, email address, phone number, physical address, IP address and payment method. We use these details to deliver you the license key and provide you customer support.

**Contacting us**  

When you contact us using the contact form via the Website or emailing us directly, any personally identifiable information you send to us is only used to identify you as a client and help with your support issue.

For bug tracking purposes, you can send us crash/exception logs that help us improve the app. These logs have an optional setting to include your email address, which we only use to get back to you when we fix the bug.
