**Placing an order**  
When you place an order from our Website, it is processed by one of the third party payment processors we use: Shareit/DigitalRiver, BlueSnap, Paypro Global, 2 Checkout/Avangate. They collect personally identifiable information such as your full name, company, email address, phone number, physical address, IP address, payment method and credit card information, to be able to process your payment and issue an invoice.
