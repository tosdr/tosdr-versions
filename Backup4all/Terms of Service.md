We deliberately state that the Backup4all Logo cannot be used as link between the pages of another website without the prior written consent of Softland. Also, the Logo cannot be used as link between the Internet pages of a different company. Delivery of the Backup4all Logo to other persons of corporations is prohibited.
2. The Backup4all Logo cannot be modified in any way - including proportions, colors, constituent elements - and cannot be subject to any transformation, animation or any other processes.

The Backup4all Logo cannot be used on websites that discredit the Backup4all name or that of Softland products or services, infringe upon intellectual property or other Softland rights, or violate the laws in force in Romania. The Backup4all Logo cannot be used in association with material or information that is immoral or remote from "common sense" or moral values promoted by Softland.
4. The Backup4all Logo can only be used in a trustworthy manner and can only be associated with credible and verifiable information. The Backup4all Logo cannot be used to imply relationships with Softland or approvals or sponsorships with no legal bases.
5. Softland reserves the right to approve or disapprove any use of the Backup4all Logo to ensure its correct use, in accordance with Softland’s policy.
