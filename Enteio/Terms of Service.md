We make no warranty or representation and disclaim all responsibility and liability for:

#### **15\. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN PROCEDURES FOR ALL USERS**

a) DMCA Takedown Notice: If Users believe that any content on our websites or apps violates their copyright, and Users wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA Takedown Notice")) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent.

i. User's physical or electronic signature;

ii. Identification of the copyrighted work(s) that Users claim to have been infringed;

iii. Identification of the material on our websites or apps that Users claim is infringing and that Users request us to remove;

iv. Sufficient information to permit us to locate and access such material;

v. User's address, telephone number, and email address;

vi. A statement that Users have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and

vii. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that Users are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that Users are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

b) Copyright Agent: Ente's Copyright Agent to receive DMCA Takedown Notices is Manav Rathi, at [dmca@ente.io](mailto:dmca@ente.io) or write to us at Ente, Attn: DMCA Notice, 1111B S Governors Ave #6032, Dover, DE 19904. Users acknowledge that for us to be authorized to take down any content, User's DMCA Takedown Notice must comply with all the requirements of this Section. Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney's fees incurred by Ente in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement. 

c) User's Obligations: We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our Services comply with copyright laws. Users are strictly prohibited from using our Services to infringe copyright. Users may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any Files, Data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.

d) Our Rights: We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to Users. In appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate User's account if we consider Users to be a bad actor or repeat infringer.

e) DMCA Counter-Notices: A counter notification is a legal request for Ente to reinstate a File or Data that was taken down for alleged copyright infringement.

1. Users may file a counter-notice if Users believe that access to a File Users have uploaded has been wrongly or mistakenly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice. Users should only do so if Users are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or Users have rights to store the material and, if Users are sharing it, that Users have the right to do so.
    
2. Users understand that:
    
    i. When we receive User's counter-notice, we pass it, including User's address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice. By submitting User's counter-notice Users authorize us to do so.
    
    ii. Filing a counter-notice may lead to legal proceedings between Users and the complaining party. Submitting a counter notice can have real legal consequences. If the complaining party disagrees that their DMCA Takedown Notice was mistaken, they might decide to file a lawsuit against Users to keep the content disabled. Users should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the DMCA Takedown Notice and talk to a lawyer before submitting a counter notice.
    
    iii. There may be adverse legal consequences if Users make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process. If, when using this counter-notice process, Users make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these Terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs, damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from Users that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in our account.
    
    iv. We provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown regimes, but in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those as set out in these Terms. We may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.
    
    v. In order to file a counter notice, Users must have "a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled" (U.S. Code, Title 17, Section 512(g).) Whether Users decide to explain why Users believe there was a mistake is up to Users and User's lawyer, but Users do need to identify a mistake before Users submit a counter notice.
    
    vi. After redacting personal information, we may publish redacted versions of complete and actionable counter notices on our Website.
    
    vii. Ente isn't the judge. Ente exercises little discretion in this process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.
    
3. By filing a counter-notice, Users are deemed to have accepted the above Terms. If Users do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.
    
4. To file a counter-notice with us, Users must provide a written communication to [dmca@ente.io](mailto:copyright@ente.io) that includes substantially the following:
    
    i. Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.
    
    ii. User's full name, address, telephone number, email address and the name within User's Ente account.
    
    iii. The statement: "I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
    
    iv. The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.
    
    v. The statement "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which Ente Technologies, Inc. is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant."
    
    vi. A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email.
    
5. We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the User from whose account a folder or file has been disabled. Counter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with the Ente Account.
    
6. If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.
    
7. Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.
    

f) Takedown of Objectionable Content: We feel privacy is a human right - that is why we are building our Services. But we are not above the law. We will comply with reasonable takedown requests for objectionable content, and will promptly inform Users of any requests received against them where appropriate and practicable under applicable law. We also reserve the right to take any other action we deem fit, including disabling accounts where objectionable content is discovered, to the extent permitted by law.

#### **16\. ASSIGNMENT BY ANY USER**

This Agreement is only for Users' benefit. Users shall have no right to assign this Agreement or any benefits or obligation hereunder to any other party or legal entity. Any attempted assignment shall be void.

#### **17\. ANTI-BRIBERY AND EXPORT COMPLIANCE FOR ALL USERS**

Users agree not to promote, approach, use, distribute, transfer, provide, sub-license, share with, or otherwise offer our Services in violation of any laws or this Agreement, including, including anti-corruption statutes. Without limiting the foregoing, Users will not knowingly directly or indirectly export, re-export, transfer, make available or release (collectively, "Export") our Services, Services to any destination, person, entity or end-use prohibited or restricted under the applicable law without prior US government authorization to the extent required by the applicable export control regulations, including without limitation, to any parties listed on any of the denied parties lists or specially designated nationals lists to the extent required by the applicable regulations.

#### **18\. MODIFICATIONS**

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify this Agreement at any time. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our updated Agreement.

#### **19\. RELATIONSHIP OF ENTE WITH USERS**

The parties hereto are independent contractors, and nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as creating any relationship other than that of independent contracting parties. The parties shall not be construed as being partners, joint ventures, shareholders, employer/employee, or agent/servant. The User has no power or authority to bind Ente to any obligation, agreement, debt or liability. The User shall not hold itself out as an agent or representative of Ente.

#### **20\. GOVERNING LAW FOR ALL USERS**

This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflicts of laws principles. Each of the parties to this Agreement consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions not subject to Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provisions as set forth in Section 21.

#### **21\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION FOR ALL USERS**

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, Users and Ente agree (a) to waive Users' and Ente's respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement, use of our Services, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive Users' and Ente's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, Users and Ente agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or a jury in court).

b. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions

Users and Ente agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or use or access of our Services is personal to Users and Ente and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Users and Ente agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, Users and Ente agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

c. Federal Arbitration Act

Users and Ente agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

d. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution

Users and Ente agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitral or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Ente shall be sent by certified mail or courier to Ente, Attn: Manav Rathi, 1111B S Governors Ave #6032, Dover, DE 19904. Users' notice must include (a) Users' name, postal address, telephone number, the email address Users use or used for User's Ente account and, if different, an email address at which Users can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that Users are seeking. Our notice to Users will be sent electronically in accordance with this Agreement and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If Users and Ente cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either Users or Ente may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section, commence an arbitration proceeding.

e. Process

EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES IN WHICH EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR SEEKS INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FOR THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, LOGOS, TRADE SECRETS OR PATENTS, USERS AND ENTE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE MUST BE COMMENCED OR FILED BY USERS OR ENTE WITHIN (1) YEAR OF THE DATE THE DISPUTE AROSE, OTHERWISE THE UNDERLYING CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED (WHICH MEANS THAT USERS AND ENTE WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT SUCH CLAIM REGARDING THE DISPUTE). Users and Ente agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. Users may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of User's billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

f. Authority of Arbitrator

As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitral, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the applicable AAA Rules, discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to one set of interrogatories, one set of requests for admissions, and one set of requests for production of documents.

The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" Section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If Users prevail in arbitration Users will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration.

g. Rules of AAA

The AAA Rules are available at [https://www.adr.org/Rules](https://www.adr.org/Rules) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, Users either (a) acknowledge and agree that Users have read and understand the rules of AAA, or (b) waive User's opportunity to read the rules of AAA and any claim that the rules of AAA are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

h. Severability

If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth herein are severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law. 

i. Opt-Out Right

USERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE USERS FIRST ACCEPTED THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION BY WRITING TO: ENTE, RE: OPT-OUT, 1111B S GOVERNORS AVE #6032, DOVER, DE 19904. IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE OPT OUT NOTICE MUST INCLUDE USER'S FULL NAME AND CLEARLY INDICATE USER'S INTENT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION. BY OPTING OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION, USERS ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 20.

#### **22\. MISCELLANEOUS**

This Agreement along with our [Privacy Policy](https://ente.io/privacy) constitutes the entire agreement between Users and Ente and supersedes any prior agreements between Users and Ente with respect to the subject matter herein. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, we both nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to our intentions as reflected in this provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement to remain in full force and effect. Users agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our Services or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A party's failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. All the sections intended to survive the termination of this Agreement shall survive. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to Ente shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to Ente at 1111B S Governors Ave #6032, Dover, DE 19904. Any notices to Users shall be provided to Users through our Services or given to Users via the email address Users provide to Ente.
