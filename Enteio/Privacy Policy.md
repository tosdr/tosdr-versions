#### **8\. BIOMETRIC INFORMATION PRIVACY POLICY**

We allow you to search and categorize your photos by the faces of the people in them. This feature, when available, will only be enabled after getting your consent, and can be disabled in settings subsequently. This section describes our policies around handling such information.

We collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your biometric information when you use Ente's platform, websites or apps (together "Services") in the following manner:

1. Biometric Data Defined. As defined in the Biometric Information Privacy Act ("BIPA") biometric data includes "biometric identifiers" and "biometric information" (740 ILCS § 14/1, et seq). "Biometric identifier" means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voice-print, or scan of a hand and or face geometry. "Biometric information" means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual.

2. Biometric Information Collected by Us. Ente extracts, stores, uses and discloses Biometric Information like facial geometry from your photos and videos for the sole purpose of allowing you to search and organize your Files based on the people within them. The derivation of such Biometric Information happens on the your device, and **such Biometric Information is encrypted with your Keys before such information leaves the device, so we do not have access to any Biometric Information.**

3. Why We Collect Biometric Information and our Legal basis to Process It. Before processing Biometric Information, Subscribers will be prompted to affirmatively consent to this Biometric Information Privacy Policy. Biometric Information is processed only after the Subscriber has explicitly provided us consent to do so. Our processing of Biometric Information is for the SOLE PURPOSE of allowing Subscribers to search and organize their photos and videos on Ente's Platform.

4. Disclosure of Your Biometric Information. Other than to provide Subscribers with Ente's Services, **Ente will not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from the Biometric Information that it collects.** Ente will not will disclose or disseminate Biometric Information for purposes other than to provide our services to you, unless (a) you or your legally authorized representative provides written consent to such disclosure; or (b) the disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

5. How We Store Your Biometric Information. Once captured, your Biometric Information is encrypted with your Keys and stored by Ente on its servers, in a secure manner. Ente shall use a reasonable standard of care to store, transmit, and protect from disclosure any Biometric Information collected. Such storage, transmission, and protection from disclosure shall be performed in a manner that is the same as or more protective than the manner in which Ente stores, transmits, and protects from disclosure other confidential and sensitive information, including personal information that can be used to uniquely identify an individual.

6. Retention Schedule.
    
    a. While you are subscribed: We keep your Biometric Information in an encrypted form while you are subscribed to our Services, subject to the suspension and termination of your Account, in accordance with our [Terms](https://ente.io/terms).
    
    b. After suspension/termination of your account: After account termination, all your Biometric Information will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate purging process is run, but no later than sixty (60) days. Unless otherwise stated in this Section, we may retain your Biometric Information for no more than sixty (60) days after the termination or suspension of your account, unless a longer retention period is required by subpoena, warrant, court order or other legal requirement ("Retention Period"). After the Retention Period has expired, we shall permanently destroy such Biometric Information from our systems.
    
    c. Services to other users: If you have shared your Files with another Ente user, your Biometric Information might continue to be retained after account termination to allow Services to continue for such other users. After such user's account is terminated or suspended, we shall permanently destroy such Biometric Information from our systems.
