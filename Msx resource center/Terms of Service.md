Policies
========

**Introduction**

Welcome to the MSX Resource Center website! The MSX Resource Center website is your one-stop MSX source of MSX news, information and discussions on the web. We hope you will enjoy our services, but do ask you to take the following into account when using our site. Upon using our site, you declare to have read the following carefully, and to agree with its contents. Use of our site is subject to our policies and this agreement between you (the User or Member) and the MSX Resource Center Foundation (MRC).

These policies and the present agreement apply to all websites in the msx.org domain, such as **[www.msx.org](http://www.msx.org/)**, **nl.msx.org**, etcetera. This agreement also covers any future domains and/or services unless stated otherwise.

These policies were not made to limit you in any way, nor to detract from the fun and enjoyment we hope you will have when using our site. They are merely made to protect the MRC and its users from people that may have less than honorable intentions.

**Acceptance**

Upon using our site, you declare to have read the following carefully and to have agreed with its contents. You also declare to periodically check the policies for changes. Minors, under the age of 18, are not our target group, and our site may therefore contain material that is not adequate for underage viewers. This material may include, but is not limited to, harsh language, sexually explicit terms, graphic material with full or partial nudity, animated violence and other types of potentially objectionable material. We suggest parents use their judgement to supervise the use of this site or disallow it altogether.

**Services**

The MRC website is made and maintained by a group of dedicated volunteers as a free service to people of the MSX community. Members of the MRC staff are not professionally trained, and do not receive financial compensation for their efforts. This means that a website such as the MRC website may be more prone to errors and/or incorrect/inappropriate content than websites maintained by professionals. Apart from human error, the MRC website may also suffer from technical difficulties, which may or may not affect the accessibility of the site. While the MRC considers all the content stored on its site as particularly valuable, technical difficulties can corrupt and/or erase this data. While efforts are made to prevent such a loss, MRC cannot, in any event, be held responsible for the loss of content. The services provided by MRC are provided AS IS, and may be temporarily or permanently suspended at any time without prior notice.

**1 - General Rulings**

**1.1** MRC is a free service provided by the MRC Foundation. Anyone may use the services provided by the MRC website, unless access or usage has been denied by the MRC. When using the MRC website and/or downloading files of its server by any means, you are bound to this agreement and these policies and agree to act accordingly.

**1.2** By becoming a member of the MRC, by means of opening a user account, you gain access to members-only facilities such as our forums. Anyone may become a member of the MRC, unless access or usage has been denied by the MRC. Membership is free. It is not required to donate to become a member, nor will donating members enjoy other facilities/treatment than non-donating members.

**1.3** The MRC Foundation preserves the right to deny usage of the MRC and/or restrict access to the MRC website without prior notice and/or justification. Members of the MRC may cancel their membership at any time, by contacting the MRC Foundation using the email address [**contact@msx.org**](mailto:contact@msx.org).

**1.4** By disagreeing with this agreement/these policies you agree to cease using the MRC and its services immediately.

**2 - Submitted Content**

**2.1** Content submitted to the MRC remains copyright of the author/copyright owner.

Once content has been submitted to the MRC, the author/copyright owner agree to irrevocably allow the MRC to have this content displayed online and/or available for download. This ruling is solely meant to protect the archival value of the MRC, and to prevent disruption of the integrity of the content of the MRC.
