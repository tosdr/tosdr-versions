This Cybrary, Inc. (“Cybrary”, “us” or “our”) Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains our practices, defines our users’ (“you” or “your”) privacy options, and describes how your information is collected and used by Cybrary. This Privacy Policy, along with our [Terms of Service](http://cybrary.it/terms-service), applies to your use of all Cybrary-branded products and services including your use of our website at [www.cybrary.it](http://www.cybrary.it/) (“Site”), any services provided by Cybrary any web or mobile applications we develop (collectively, our “Platform”). This Privacy Policy explains:

* the information we collect about you;
* how that information may be used;
* with whom the information may be shared;
* how you may update the information you provide us;
* how you may contact us; and
* your choices about the information.

By using the Cybrary Platform, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

COLLECTION AND USE OF USER INFORMATION
--------------------------------------

This Privacy Policy primarily concerns Personal Information, which deals with individuals, rather than organizations or businesses. “Personal Information” uniquely identifies an individual or can identify an individual by combining it with other data. It includes email addresses, phone numbers and other information associated with the individual. The legal name and definition of personal information differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Cybrary will not use or share Personal Information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

We collect Personal Information from you through our Platform, or through any other digital or personal communication between you and us. Personal Information collected by us may include your name, e-mail address, billing address, general usage metrics of the Platform, your financial payment information, your profile, email communication history with Cybrary, anything you submit to or post on the Sites, and other information associated with you or your organization, as well as other information that may or may not specifically identify you. The information collected through the Platform may be stored at servers, computers, or other media located in the United States. We may also collect general information about your technology interfaces or preferences and the websites you visit. We may use a third party provider to process financial and payment information.

We may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as Google or Apple. This information may be utilized, analyzed, and/or compared with information that Cybrary has collected from you or that you have submitted to the Platform. If Cybrary obtains information from third-party sources, you agree that your sole legal remedy for any harm associated with that information is against the third-party that provided the information to us, and that you will not assert any cause of action, claim or demand against us other than requesting we delete any erroneous information.

For the avoidance of doubt, Cybrary shall be entitled to collect anonymous and/or aggregated data across its various products and services provided that no individual natural person can be identified from such data (“Aggregate Data”). The Aggregate Data will be used for various purposes, including without limitation to analyze behavior, trends, and website interaction, and to improve, and enhance our services and for other development, creation of new features, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with our services. Cybrary shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Aggregate Data and this is not considered personal data.

Technical and specification information about your device and settings may be collected when you use the Sites. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, the content of previously accepted “cookies” from us, and clickstream data.

PROTECTION OF USER INFORMATION
------------------------------

We maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for all user information collected in our Platform. However, given the nature of communications and information technology, and that the use of the Internet has inherent risks, although we regularly monitor for possible vulnerabilities and attack, we cannot warrant or guarantee that information provided to us through the Platform or stored in our systems or otherwise will be absolutely free from unauthorized intrusion by others, nor can we warrant or guarantee that such data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Therefore, although we take reasonable steps to secure your information, we cannot and do not promise or warrant that your information will always remain secure.

EXTERNAL LINKS AND THIRD PARTY PRIVACY PRACTICES
------------------------------------------------

Cybrary cannot guarantee or verify the contents of any externally linked website. You should therefore note you click on external links at your own risk and Cybrary cannot be held liable for any damages or implications caused by visiting any external links. This Privacy Policy does not cover any third party’s use or handling of your information once it is shared. Instead, the privacy policy of the third-party will govern. We encourage you to visit the websites of those third-parties and fully read and understand their privacy policies. Some of these entities will have different privacy terms than we do and their servers may be located outside the United States.

The Platform may link to other websites, including but not limited to health care provider pages, or through advertisements. We disclaim any and all responsibility for the privacy practices of third-parties that may have links to or from our Platform. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and privacy statements of every website that you visit that collects personally identifiable information.
