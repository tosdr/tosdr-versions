RESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND. As defined in FAR section 2.101, DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(5) or otherwise, the Software and accompanying Documentation provided in connection with this Agreement are “commercial items,” “commercial computer software” and/or “commercial computer software documentation.”  Consistent with DFAR section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure or distribution thereof by or for the government shall be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. The foregoing does not apply if you are located outside North America and Latin America.

7\. General Terms. You acknowledge that the Device, Software, and Documentation provided by Call Control are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. You represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity appearing on the lists published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Treasury or any other list that may be published by the U.S. Government, as amended from time to time, that is prohibited from acquiring ownership or control of items under this Agreement, or with which Call Control is prohibited from doing business. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of California. Any legal claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereunder or the breach thereof shall likewise be governed by the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule and shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding and waives any objection based on improper venue or forum non conveniens. Notices to be given or submitted by either party to other pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), or (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. The parties acknowledge that they are acting as independent contractors who are solely responsible for their own actions or inactions and that no joint venture, franchise, partnership, agency, or other relationship shall be created or implied by this Agreement. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of your obligations or performance, under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise. Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this provision is void. Call Control may freely assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer all or any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement without your consent. If any court of competent jurisdiction adjudges any provision of this Agreement to be to be illegal, unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable, but shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. You acknowledge and agree that there can be no adequate remedy at law for any material breach of this Agreement, which breach will result in irreparable harm to Call Control, and therefore, upon any such breach or any threat thereof, Call Control is entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against you (and, if applicable, your officers or employees) without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to whatever remedies Call Control might have at law. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing and signed by each party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the waiving party.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) COMPLIANCE STATEMENT  
This equipment complies with Part 15 of the FCC rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.  
Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.  
This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures: —Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna. —Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver. —Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected. —Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.  
This equipment complies with Part 68 of the FCC rules and the requirements adopted by the ACTA.

If requested, this number must be provided to the telephone company.  
A plug and jack used to connect this equipment to the premises wiring and telephone network must comply with the applicable FCC Part 68 rules and requirements adopted by the ACTA. A compliant telephone cord and modular plug is provided with this product. It is designed to be connected to a compatible modular jack that is also compliant. See installation instructions for details. This equipment uses USOC RJ11C for all operations.  
The REN is used to determine the number of devices that may be connected to a telephone line. Excessive RENs on a telephone line may result in the devices not ringing in response to an incoming call. In most but not all areas, the sum of RENs should not exceed five (5.0). To be certain of the number of devices that may be connected to a line, as determined by the total RENs, contact the local telephone company.  
The REN for this product is part of the product identifier that has the format US:AAAEQ##TXXX. The digits represented by ## are the REN without a decimal point (e.g., 03 is a REN of 0.3).  
If this equipment causes harm to the telephone network, the telephone company will notify you in advance that temporary discontinuance of service may be required. But if advance notice isn’t practical, the telephone company will notify the customer as soon as possible. Also, you will be advised of your right to file a complaint with the FCC if you believe it is necessary.  
The telephone company may make changes in its facilities, equipment, operations or procedures that could affect the operation of the equipment. If this happens the telephone company will provide advance notice in order for you to make necessary modifications to maintain uninterrupted service.  
If trouble is experienced with this equipment, for repair or warranty information, please contact Call Control LLC at 206-552-8126. If the equipment is causing harm to the telephone network, the telephone company may request that you disconnect the equipment until the problem is resolved.

Privacy Policy
--------------

We recognize that users, visitors and customers of our websites, mobile applications and related services (collectively, the “Service”) highly value their privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in connection with your use of the Service. We provide this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use our Service. The terms ”we”, ”us” and ”our” refer to EveryCaller.com, which is owned and operated by Call Control LLC, a Washington State Limited Liability Corporation. When you use the Service, you accept our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you may choose not to use the Service.

**Cookies and Information That We Collect**

Cookies. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies the browser you employ. We use both persistent and session cookies. A persistent cookie stays after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. You can remove persistent cookies by following the help file directions of your browser. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

Log Information That We Collect. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

Clear GIFs Information That We Collect. We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (aka web beacons), that help us better manage our services and or content by tracking the online usage patterns of our users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

Device / Phone Information That We Collect.  The Application periodically sends infromation to our servers that contains the unique device identifier, information about calls and text messages while using the Service such as the caller or sender’s phone number and date and time the call or text message was received, non-contact phone numbers of incoming calls and text messages and usage statistics.

Support requests submitted through the Service may contain personal or private information including but not limited to contacts, messages or recent call logs to help us with supporting and troubleshooting issues or problems. You consent to the transmission of this information through your use of the service.

Online Backup with Web Server.  As a service to you, the Service automatically transmits backups of information (name, phone number) of entries stored within your device such as your Blocked List, Allowed List and Settings.  This information is periodically sychronized with our web servers and can be restored by accessing your account.

**How We Use Your Information**  
We do not spam! To be more specific, we do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send you any commercial messages without your consent.

We primarily use the information that you provide and that we collect to provide you with the Service, personalize your use of the Service (for example, to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about traffic and interaction so that we can offer better experiences and tools in the future) and to maintain and improve the Service. We may also use your information to:

• Track and analyze user preferences and behavior;

• Display relevant advertising;

• Send you commercial communications that you have consented to receive, also known as “opt-in.” For these commercial communications, you will have the ability to “opt-out” at any time by clicking on the opt-out link that is in the footer of each email communication we send or by sending a request to disable your account to support@everycaller.com;

• Communicate with you for administrative (for example, customer service) or legal purposes. Please note that you cannot “opt-out” of receiving required administrative or legal notices;

• Monitor (a) the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, (b) metrics such as pages viewed, number of visitors, etc. and (c) your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, and contests;

• Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;

• Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms;

• Conduct market research aimed at improving the products and service our affiliated product manufacturers and/or service firms provide to you; and

• Log your mobile phone unique device identifier, phone carrier, and the date and time that the information was processed if you use your mobile phone to send information to or receive information from the Service.

Disclosure of Your Information  
We do not share your personally identifiable information or any personal information contained within your device or phone that you send to us (such as name, phone number or email address) with other companies for their commercial use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out; however, non-personally identifiable visitor information in aggregated form may be provided to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses without restriction.

Certain personal information that you submit and other content you post to the Service is meant for public display and is therefore not subject to this Privacy Policy. We may display this information and content on the Service and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services that may become publically viewable.

We do not store or retain any credit card information. Any credit card information that you provide is securely transmitted to our credit card processor Elavon and we have no access to your full credit card number at any time. Your name and address are stored within their servers to aide in customer support and/or fraud management at a later time. We do not store or share your name, address or credit card information related to a purchase.

In addition, we may share information about you:

• With our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or third parties or persons to process such information on our behalf and provide, maintain, and improve the Service;

• With third parties that run advertising campaigns, contests, special offers, or other events or activities in connection with the Service;

• To trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you;

• With third parties in anonymous form only. User IDs are replaced with individual identifying codes, and we are the only entity with access to the associated user information;

• If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to enforce our Terms or policies; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including, without limitation, the filtering of spam); to protect the security or integrity of the Service and to protect us, our users or others from harm or illegal activities;

• In connection with, or during the negotiation of, any merger, sale of company stock or assets, financing, acquisition, divestiture, or dissolution of all or a portion of our business. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used; and

• With your consent.

All third parties that receive your information are bound by contractual obligations to keep personally identifiable information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites  
We allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements to the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the characteristics of the audience they are attempting to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Service, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

We recommend you consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

We have agreements or are in the process of establishing agreements with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:

Google – http://www.google.com/adsense

Security  
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. Therefore, while we endeavor to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We expect you to not share your password with anyone.

Accessing and Correcting Your Information  
You can close your account or review and change your personal information by logging into your account and visiting your account profile page, through the mobile application or by sending us e-mail at support@everycaller.com. We will accommodate any request to change information unless such request would violate any law or legal requirement or regulation or cause the information to be incorrect. If you terminate your account, we may continue to show some of your content in anonymized form. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, verify transactions collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our rights and take other actions permitted by law.

How to delete your account and related data  
You can have your account and all related data deleted permanently from our system by sending a request to support@callcontrol.com with the subject line DELETE MY INFO. Comments and call reports that you have made will not be deleted as you have contributed this information to our community and have licensed the use of that material according to our Terms of Service.

Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance  
We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) and do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our Service is intended for people who are at least 13 years old or older.

Your California Privacy Rights  
California law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us as provided below.

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically. The date the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. If we make changes, we will post an updated Privacy Policy and revise the “Last Updated” date above. You are responsible for periodically visiting this Privacy Policy to check for any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we have received the personal information you provided.

The existence of a complaint, comment or posting is not indicative of any wrong doing by the company, individual, or companies at issue. While users may indicate wrong doing on the part of an individual or company, EveryCaller.com makes no presumptions of wrong doing.
