**Date of Last Revision: January 11, 2024**

Subject to these Terms of Service, as amended from time to time (“Terms of Service”), [GoFundMe Inc.](https://www.gofundme.com/) provides the GoFundMe platform to you through its website at www.gofundme.com and attendant mobile applications (collectively, with any new features and applications, the “Platform”) and the GoFundMe Community and related services (collectively, with the Platform, including any new features and applications, the “Services”). If you are an Organizer (as defined below), Beneficiary (as defined below) to a Fundraiser (as defined below), comment contributor, or Donor (as defined below) (collectively referred to herein as a “User”) located in the United States, you are contracting with GoFundMe Inc., ℅ Legal Department, PO Box 121270, 815 E Street, San Diego, CA, 92101, United States. If you are a User located outside of the United States but not in Australia, you are contracting with GoFundMe Ireland, Limited – Company Number: 581748, VAT Number: 3417986GH, 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, D02R296, Phone Number: [+353 1 232 2000](tel:+35312322000). If you are a User located in Australia, you are contracting with GoFundMe Australia PTY Ltd., Tower One – International Towers Sydney, Level 46, 100 Barangaroo Avenue, 2000, Sydney, NSW. 

For purposes of the following Terms of Service, “GoFundMe,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and other similar terms, shall refer to the party with whom you are contracting.  For the avoidance of doubt, GoFundMe Inc. may apply, and exercise our rights under, these Terms of Service on behalf of the party that you are contracting with. Details of your options for contact us can be found at the end of these Terms of Service,

US USERS ONLY : ARBITRATION, JURY TRIAL, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER –: EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE DESCRIBED IN THE DISPUTES SECTION BELOW, BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. PLEASE REVIEW THE DISPUTES SECTION CAREFULLY.

BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. Where possible we will provide 30 days’ notice of substantive changes to these Terms of Service and, if appropriate, we may inform users of such changes via email or other appropriate means. Changes may be made at short or no notice where a change is required by law. When we make a change, we will post the revised Terms of Service on this page and will indicate the date of such revision.

Your continued use of the Services after the date of any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. To the extent allowed by applicable law, the English language version of these Terms of Service is binding and their translations in other languages are for convenience only; in case of discrepancies between the English version of these Terms of Service and their translations, the English version shall prevail. If you do not wish to accept the new Terms of Service, you should discontinue your use of the Services.

In addition, when using the Services,, you will be subject to additional applicable policies including without limitation as set out in, the [Privacy Notice](https://www.gofundme.com/c/privacy). 

ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES

The Services Description: The Services are offered as a platform to allow an individual, entity or non-profit organization (the “Organizer”) to post a fundraiser (“Fundraiser”) to the Platform to accept monetary donations (“Donations”) from donors (“Donors”) on behalf of the beneficiary of the Fundraiser (“Beneficiary”).  We also operate Classy.org through our affiliate, Classy, Inc. which primarily provides certain services to non-profit organizations in the US. 

Payment Processor:  GoFundMe is not a payment processor and does not hold any funds.  Instead, GoFundMe uses third-party payment processing partners to process Donations for a Fundraiser (“Payment Processor”).  You acknowledge and agree that the use of Payment Processors is integral to the Services and that we exchange information with Payment Processors in order to facilitate the provision of the Services.  See the section “Payment Processors “ hereafter and our [Privacy Notice](https://www.gofundme.com/c/privacy) for details of the third parties we work and share information with.

Transaction Fee: Although there are no fees to start or maintain a Fundraiser, please keep in mind that a transaction fee, including credit and debit charges, is deducted from each donation (hereinafter and on the website referred to as “Transaction Fee”). To learn more about the Platform and the applicable Transaction Fee, visit [GoFundMe Pricing](https://www.gofundme.com/c/pricing).

The Services are Platforms; We are not a Broker, Financial Institution, Creditor or Charity: The Services are administrative platforms only. GoFundMe facilitates the Fundraiser of the Organizers and permits Donors to make donations to these Fundraisers. GoFundMe is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor nor nonprofit corporation.

All third party information and content hosted by us on the Services is for informational purposes only, and GoFundMe does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or reliability of any such information or content. No content is intended to provide financial, legal, tax or other professional advice. Before making any decisions regarding any Fundraisers, Charities (as defined below), Donations, Donors, or any information or content relating to the Services, you should consult your financial, legal, tax or other professional advisor as appropriate. You acknowledge that all information and content accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk.

GoFundMe has no control over the conduct of, or any information provided by, a User and hereby disclaims all liability in this regard to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. We do not guarantee that a Fundraiser will obtain a certain amount of Donations or any Donations at all. We do not endorse any Fundraiser, User, or cause and we make no guarantee, express or implied, that any information provided through the Services is accurate. We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the outcome or success of any Fundraiser. You, as a Donor, must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of contributing to any User or Fundraiser.

No Solicitation: The Platform is offered to help Organizers raise money. GoFundMe merely provides the technology to allow Fundraisers to connect with Donors. The existence of the Services is not a solicitation of donations by GoFundMe, and GoFundMe does not engage in any solicitation activities, or consult on the solicitation of contributions from the public, on behalf of any individual, entity, or organization. By using the Services, you understand and agree that GoFundMe is not responsible for the use of your Donations or the amount of funds raised for the User or Fundraiser.

Donors: All Donations are at your own risk. When you make a Donation through the Platform, it is your responsibility to understand how your money will be used and to check the Fundraiser content regularly for any updates. GoFundMe is not responsible for any offers, promises, rewards or Promotions (as defined below) made or offered by Users or Fundraisers; such conduct violates these Terms of Service. We do not and cannot verify the information that Users or Fundraisers supply, nor do we represent or guarantee that the Donations will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose prescribed by a User or Fundraiser or in accordance with applicable laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse of funds reported to us very seriously. You can learn more about [How We Protect Our Community](https://www.gofundme.com/c/safety). If you have reason to believe that a User or Fundraiser is not raising or using the funds for their stated purpose, please use the “Report” button on the Fundraiser to alert our team of this potential issue and we will investigate. If you are a Donor, you may also be covered by the [GoFundMe Giving Guarantee](https://www.gofundme.com/c/safety/gofundme-guarantee).

If you are a Donor to a non-profit organization, established as such under the applicable laws of incorporation or trust structure (“Charity”):

A. You are not permitted to impose restrictions on the use of such Donation by the Charity. To the extent that you make a Donation in response to an appeal for a particular program of a Charity, or to the extent that you purport to direct the use of Donations by a Charity, any such directions shall constitute non-binding recommendations only and the Charity shall have full discretion to determine how all Donations will be used.

B. You should consult your tax advisor as to the amount of your Donation that is tax deductible or eligible for tax recognition, having regard to (among other things) the tax status of the recipient of any Donation in any relevant jurisdiction. GoFundMe makes no representation as to whether all or any portion of your Donations, including, if any, Transaction Fees, are tax deductible or eligible for tax credits or an equivalent redemption. GoFundMe will have no liability for any claim by any federal, state, provincial, territorial, local or any other tax authority with respect to the characterization on any applicable tax return of any Donation by you, any User or any Charity.

C. You acknowledge and agree that, in accordance with our [Privacy Notice](https://www.gofundme.com/c/privacy), certain of your personal information will be shared with the Charity to which you make a Donation, including without limitation, as part of a Donor List (as defined below) and may be used by such Charity to issue official Donation receipts (or equivalent document) and in accordance with the Charity’s privacy policy. GoFundMe is not responsible, and shall not be liable, for any Charity’s use of any Donor information.

D. Please check here for any applicable US state-required disclosures for Charities soliciting contributions: [state non-profit disclosures](https://www.gofundme.com/c/nonprofit-disclosures). Donors outside of the US may check with their own state, federal or national agencies for equivalent provisions in their jurisdictions.

Organizers: You, as an Organizer, represent, warrant, and covenant that: (i) all information you (whether through yourself, an agent or using artificial intelligence) provide in connection with a Fundraiser or Beneficiary is accurate, complete, and not likely to deceive Users and that you will post updates as needed so that Users understand the use of funds and any other relevant information about your Fundraiser; (ii) all Donations contributed to your Fundraiser will be used solely as described in the materials that you post or otherwise provide; (iii) if you withdraw Donations believed by Donors to be raised on behalf of someone other than you (i.e., the Beneficiary), all Donations will be given to and/or spent on behalf of the Beneficiary; (iv) if you add a Beneficiary through the Services, you relinquish control of the Donations; (v) you will not infringe the rights of others; (vi) you will comply with all relevant and applicable laws and financial reporting obligations, including but not limited to, laws and obligations relating to registration, tax reporting, political contributions, and asset disclosures for your Fundraiser; (vii) to the extent you share with us any personal data of any third party for any purpose, including the names, email addresses and phone numbers of your personal contacts, you have the authority (including any necessary consents), as required under applicable law, to provide us with such personal data and allow us to use such personal data for the purposes for which you shared it with us; and (viii) you will not provide or offer to provide goods or services in exchange for Donations. You authorize GoFundMe, and GoFundMe reserves the right to provide information relating to your Fundraiser to Donors, Beneficiaries of your Fundraiser or law enforcement or other regulatory authorities, and to assist in any investigation thereof.

If you use the Services as an agent of a Charity to raise funds for such Charity, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are a representative of the Charity, which representative is authorized to raise funds for the Charity and bind the Charity to these Terms of Service; (b) you are raising funds for a Charity, with a cause or activity that is legal under all applicable federal, state, provincial, territorial and local laws and regulations; (c) all donated funds will be used solely for the purpose you have stated on and in connection with your Fundraiser, and under no circumstances may you use the funds for any other purpose; (d) your Charity has and will maintain tax-exempt status under applicable law (for example, the Internal Revenue Code in the United States or the Income Tax Act in Canada); and (e) your Charity is registered with the appropriate database for designation of tax-exempt organisations in your state or country, for example GuideStar or the IRS tax exempt organization database in the United States, or, the Canada Revenue Agency’s database of registered charities in Canada.

Your Registration Obligations: You may be required to register with GoFundMe to access and use certain features of the Services. If you choose to register for the Services, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself or your Charity as prompted by the Services’ registration form. Organizers must register using their true identities (or the identities of the Charities’ authorized representatives), including their name, address and any image or video purporting to depict the Organizer or the Beneficiary of such Fundraiser. You agree to keep registration information current and up to date.

Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by these Terms of Service, including our [Privacy Notice](https://www.gofundme.com/c/privacy). If you are under 13 years of age (16 in the  European Economical Area), you are not authorized to use the Services, with or without registering. In addition, if you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction (typically 18 or 19 years of age), you may use the Services, with or without registering, only with the approval of your parent or guardian. Certain aspects of our Services may also require you to register with, and agree to the terms of, third-party service providers (e.g., Payment Processors), with whom GoFundMe has entered into contracts, in order to be able to benefit from their services. If GoFundMe or one of our Payments Processors at any time discovers that the information you provided about you or the purpose of your Fundraiser is incorrect or violates any of these Terms of Service or their terms of service, your access to the Services may be immediately suspended and/or terminated and fines may be applied by relevant authorities, which will in all such cases be payable by you.

Charities:  The Services include the features and services described here. All Donations are subject to a Transaction Fee for each Donation.

A_. Chargebacks and Refunds_. Occasionally, a Donor may dispute a credit card charge for a Donation through the Services or submit a request for a refund under the GoFundMe Giving Guarantee.

1. 1. 1. If Donations are refunded to the Donor by PayPal or pursuant to the GoFundMe Giving Guarantee, or if PayPal Giving Fund already remitted payment to the Charity, the chargebacks or refunds will be deducted from future payments to the Charity, and if necessary, an invoice will be issued to the applicable Charity. The applicable Charity expressly agrees that: (a) it will be responsible for paying PayPal or PayPal Giving Fund the full amount of any Donation refund due to a Donor; and (b) PayPal or PayPal Giving Fund, as applicable, may elect to offset a future Donation rather than requesting that the Charity return the refunded Donation.
        2. If Donations were made through Adyen or Stripe, the Charity has control over the Donations and Charity, rather than GoFundMe or Adyen or Stripe, is responsible for issuing refunds and handling chargebacks directly with Donors.

B. _Removal of a Charity from our Database._  If you are the authorized representative of a Charity, and you do not wish for your Charity to appear in GoFundMe’s searchable database, you may contact us [here](https://www.gofundme.com/contact/suggest)to request that your Charity be removed from our database. Your email should include your full name, title, and an email address and phone number associated with your Charity. Please note that if your Charity is removed from the GoFundMe’s database, it will not be eligible to receive contributions through the Platform.

C_. Receiving Funds_. As a Charity, receipt of Donations, minus any applicable Transaction Fees, is based upon and subject to the applicable Payment Processor’s procedures and terms. Available Payment Processors are described under “Payment Processors for Charities” below. GoFundMe is not a payment processor and does not hold funds.

D_. Taxes._  GoFundMe does not withhold funds for tax purposes or otherwise. Charities will be solely responsible for taxes based on applicable international, federal, state, local or any other taxes or levies, or for any applicable taxes based on their net income or gross receipts (if any).

E_. Donor Lists and Other Data._  A Charity may access information about an Organizer of a Fundraiser for the Charity, Donor Lists (defined below) and Donor Data (defined below) for compliance and transactional purposes. Please contact us [here](https://www.gofundme.com/contact/suggest)with any questions. “Donor Data” means a Donor’s name, email address, Donation amount, date of transaction, transaction identification number, and name of the project. THE LIST OF DONORS WHO CONTRIBUTE TO A CHARITY’S FUNDRAISER THROUGH THE SERVICES (“DONOR LISTS”) IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND GOFUNDME MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR TIMELINESS OF ANY DONOR LIST OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. Even if a Donor checks the “Anonymous” checkbox at the time of Donation, the Donor consents to the disclosure of Donor’s Donor Data as described herein, including without limitation, disclosure as part of a Donor List.

Taxes: It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the Donations you receive through your use of the Services. It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report or remit the correct tax, if any, to the appropriate tax authority.

Member Account, Password and Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to: (i) immediately notify GoFundMe of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security; and (ii) sign out from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Services. GoFundMe will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.

reCAPTCHA:  The Platform uses the reCAPTCHA product to provide an added level of security.  reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US).

GoogleMaps:  The Platform uses the Google Maps feature and content, which is subject to the then-current versions of the: (i) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at [https://maps.google.com/help/terms\_maps.html](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html); and (ii) Google Privacy Policy at [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

Modifications to the Services: GoFundMe reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) at any time and for any reason, , and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,  without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs, or losses resulting therefrom. While GoFundMe will endeavor to provide notice of planned modifications or disruptions to the Service, this may not be possible in the case or unplanned outages or legally mandated changes. 

Content Manifestly Made Public by the User.

A_. Public Content; Public Display of Information and Donations._Some of your activity on and through the Services is public, such as content you post publicly on the Platform (including descriptions, texts, music, sound, information, data, software, graphics, comments, photos, videos, images, trademarks, logos, brands or other materials you upload or post through the Services, including through GoFundMe Clips or other functions on the GoFundMe Platform, or share with other Users or recipients) (collectively, “User Content”). Additionally, User profile information, including your first and last name, public email address, organization, personal biography, and other information you enter in connection with your User profile may be displayed to other Users to facilitate User interaction within the Services. For example, as an Organizer, you might post your personal data – such as information about a recent hospital stay – which data might be considered sensitive data. In addition, as a Donor, you have the option to publicly display your Donation for all to see, including on search engines (like Google and Yahoo). To keep the details of your Donation private from the general public, click the “Private” checkbox during the Donation process. However, your information will still be disclosed to the Organizer, their team members, the Beneficiary and otherwise needed in accordance with our Privacy Notice. Please see our [Privacy Notice](https://www.gofundme.com/c/privacy) for information on the ways that we may collect, use, and store certain information about you and your use of the Services.

B_. Other Information._Please be advised that User Content and other information, solicited or unsolicited, that you provide to GoFundMe may be publicly accessible, such as information you post in forums, comment sections or in response to surveys we may send out. We also collect information through customer support communications, your communications to us of ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions, or any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information about the Services (collectively, with publicly-accessible information, “Other Information”). By sending us Other Information: (i) you agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, expressed or implied, with respect to the Other Information; (ii) you acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Other Information already under consideration or in development; (iii) you agree that GoFundMe will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of the Other Information for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you; (iv) you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to submit the Other Information; (v) to the extent necessary and where permitted by law, you hereby grant to GoFundMe a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully transferable and sublicensable right (through multiple tiers) and license to use, reproduce, perform, display, distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all Other Information, and to sublicense the foregoing rights; and (vi) unless such a waiver is prohibited by applicable law, you irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against GoFundMe and its Users any claims and assertions of any moral rights or equivalent contained in such Other Information. This Other Information section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.

You acknowledge that GoFundMe may preserve Other Information, as well as User Content, and may also disclose your Other Information or User Content if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process, applicable laws or government requests; (b) enforce these Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that any User Content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GoFundMe, its Users, employees or the public.

Third-Party Communications: If you use any feature of the Services that allows you to communicate with third parties (such as to refer a third party to the Services or to communicate with them regarding a Fundraiser or a Donation), either by submitting data about the third party (“Third-Party Data”) to the Services or otherwise permitting the Services to automatically access Third-Party Data in your possession, you acknowledge and agree that you have the authority (including any necessary consents) of the relevant third party for us to access and use the relevant Third-Party Data and that you have notified these third parties and informed them how their information is collected and used by GoFundMe to provide the Services. We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in any messages that are sent to them. We use Third-Party Data to: (i) contact such third party using the Third-Party Data provided; and/or (ii) provide you with an editable template message designed to facilitate communications between you and such third party through the Services. In addition to sending the foregoing communications, we may also send reminders or related messages to you and to third parties on your behalf from time to time where permitted by applicable law. In each case, any such communication sent to third parties using Third-Party Data will provide a means to “opt out” of receiving further communication of the same nature.

Promotions on the Platform: If you are located in the United Kingdom, you will be permitted to offer give-away incentives (e.g., one sticker, while supplies last, for every donation made) in connection with Your Fundraiser.   Otherwise, You are not permitted to offer any contest, competition, reward, give-away, raffle, sweepstakes or similar activity (each, a “Promotion”) on or through the Services.

Sales Prohibited on the Platform:  You are not permitted to offer any good or service in exchange for a Donation on the Platform.

Data Retention: You acknowledge that GoFundMe has no obligation to you to retain data relating to any account or Fundraiser after the conclusion of a Fundraiser. You acknowledge that, subject to any data it may retain for the purpose of complying with legal obligation and or for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending a legal claims, GoFundMe reserves the right to delete historic data or to terminate inactive accounts without notice.  GoFundMe will attempt to provide Charities with reasonable notice prior to deletion of accounts or data. Where GoFundMe has reason to suspect fraud, misuse of the Services, or any breach to these Terms of Service, GoFundMe may suspend or delete accounts or associated data of Fundraisers at any time with or without notice, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,  without any liability to Users or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom. 

Mobile Services and Text Messages: The GoFundMe Services include certain features that may be made available via a mobile device, including the ability to: (i) upload User Content to the Platform; (ii) browse the Platform; and (iii) access certain items through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, the “Mobile Services”). To the extent you access Mobile Services, your wireless service carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we may communicate with you about matters related to your account by SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device and that certain information about your usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us.  Further, when setting up your GoFundMe account, if you click “Send code” by “Text Message,” you agree to receive automated and non automated text messages related to your account from or on behalf of GoFundMe at the phone number provided.  You can reply STOP to such text messages to cancel, except for automated text messages related to the security of your account.  Message frequency will vary. Message and normal data rates may apply.  We will comply with any additional requirements that may apply under local laws and regulations before communicating with you in this manner. In the event that you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your GoFundMe account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number.

PROHIBITED CONDUCT

You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable law in relation to your Fundraiser or use of the Services. You are further solely responsible for all User Content that you upload, post, publish, display, transmit or otherwise use. You are also responsible for ensuring the funds raised are used for the purpose outlined in the Fundraiser. If you are not the Beneficiary of the Fundraiser you organize, you agree to deliver funds to the ultimate Beneficiary directly and as soon as possible. You agree to fully cooperate with any request we make for evidence we deem necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms of Service.

The following are examples of User Content and/or use that is illegal or prohibited by GoFundMe. This list is not exhaustive and we reserve the right to remove any Fundraiser and/or investigate any User who, in our sole discretion, violates any of the terms or spirit of these Terms of Service, or other policies such as the GoFundMe Giving Guarantee or Beneficiary Guarantee. As we investigate your Fundraiser, a User, or User Content, we may consider all available material including but not limited to social media, related news, and any other information that we, in our sole discretion, deem relevant in our review. We further reserve the right, without limitation, to ban or disable your use of the Services, remove the offending User Content, suspend or terminate your account, stop payments to any Fundraiser, freeze or place a hold on Donations, and report you to law enforcement authorities or otherwise take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, seeking restitution on behalf of ourselves and/or our Users.

This information may include information about you, your account, your Donors, your Donations, and transactions made through or in connection with your use of the Services.

DONOR CONDUCT

Donations: In order to contribute to a Fundraiser or to a Charity, a Donor will be required to provide information regarding the Donor’s credit card or other payment instrument (“Payment Instrument”) that is linked to the Donor’s GoFundMe account (a “Billing Account”). You, as a Donor, represent and warrant to GoFundMe that such information is true, current and accurate and that you are authorized to use the applicable Payment Instrument. You agree that a certain minimum Donation amount may apply, and that all Donations are final and will not be refunded unless GoFundMe, in its sole discretion, agrees to issue a refund, for example in accordance with the GoFundMe Giving Guarantee. GoFundMe uses third-party payment processing partners to bill you through your Payment Instrument and Billing Account for any Donations made, and Donors acknowledge that by contributing a Donation to a Fundraiser, the Donor agrees to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by the Payment Processors pursuant to these Terms of Service as well as any and all applicable terms set forth by our payment partners.  For a list of our current Payment Processors and links to their terms of service, please see the PAYMENT PROCESSORS section below.

ORGANIZERS, BENEFICIARIES OR CHARITIES

Account Holds: From time to time, GoFundMe may in response to concerns of fraudulent or illegal activity or a material breach of these Terms of Service, place a hold on a Fundraiser account (a “Hold”), restrict Withdrawals (defined herein as the transfer of Funds raised to Beneficiary), initiate a reverse ACH transfer, secure reserves, or take similar actions to protect its interests and those of its Users. Some of the reasons that we may take such actions include, but are not  limited to, our belief or determination, in our sole and absolute discretion, that: (i) information provided by an Organizer is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or funds are being used in a prohibited manner; (ii) the funds available should be provided directly to a person other than the Organizer, such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of an Organizer; (iii) a Fundraiser or Organizer has violated these Terms of Service; (iv) the Organizer is colluding with Donors to engage in fraudulent activity; (v) there may be suspicious or fraudulent Donation activity; or (vi) such action(s) is required to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations. If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Fundraiser account, or need information about how to resolve the Hold, please [see this article](https://support.gofundme.com/hc/articles/115010244128).

Withdrawing Donations from a Fundraiser: While GoFundMe strives to make Withdrawals available to you promptly but its ability to do so is dependent upon Users providing the right information and upon legal and technical systems operating as intended, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Withdrawals may not be available to you for use immediately; (ii) GoFundMe does not guarantee that Withdrawals will be always available to you within any specific time frame but shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Withdrawals as soon as reasonably possible; and (iii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, GoFundMe expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay in Withdrawals or your inability to access and use Withdrawals at any specified time, and any consequences arising from such delay or inability. GoFundMe will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to provide an indicative timescale for Withdrawal of donations where an immediate Withdrawal is not possible. You, as an Organizer and/or Beneficiary, are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide to GoFundMe in order to process a Withdrawal, including bank account information, is accurate and up to date. GoFundMe may, at any time, for any reason, without notice, and in its sole discretion, offer or issue a refund of Donation(s) with or without consulting with you, which may comprise the entire amount donated to your Fundraiser. To the extent permitted by applicable law, GoFundMe is not liable to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs, losses, or other consequences caused by GoFundMe issuing refunds, including, but not limited to transaction or overdraft fees.

PAYMENT PROCESSORS

GoFundMe uses Payment Processors to process Donations for your Fundraiser and thereafter deliver it to you. In order to withdraw funds from a Fundraiser, an Organizer or, if not the same, Beneficiary (collectively “Withdrawing Entity”) will be required to provide the Payment Processor information regarding bank account information (“Withdrawing Account”). You, as Withdrawing Entity, represent and warrant to Payment Processor and GoFundMe that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the applicable Withdrawing Account.

By setting up a Fundraiser or accepting the role of Beneficiary to a Fundraiser, the Withdrawing Entity agrees to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by the Payment Processors pursuant to these Terms of Service as well as any and all applicable terms set forth by the applicable Payment Processors.  Our current Payment Processors include: Adyen LLC ([Adyen’s terms and conditions](https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions-adyen-for-platforms/)), Stripe, Inc. ([Stripe’s terms of service](https://stripe.com/us/legal)), and PayPal, Inc. ([PayPal’s terms of service](https://www.paypal.com/ga/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full)), and PayPal Giving Fund. GoFundMe’s payment partner in the EEA is Adyen N.V. which contracts with GoFundMe Ireland. Please see Adyen N.V.’s terms and conditions [here](https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions-adyen-for-platforms/). GoFundMe’s payment partner in Australia is Adyen Australia. Adyen Australia contracts with GoFundMe’s Australian entity, GoFundMe Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 627 702 630), which entity is the contracting party responsible for transactions benefitting the Australian User, Users, please see Adyen Australia’s [Combined Financial Services Guide and Product Disclosure Statement](https://www.adyen.com/legal/combined-financial-services-guide).

Payment Processors for Charities: GoFundMe has partnered with PayPal and, in limited circumstances, Adyen or Stripe, for Donations to Charities. Although exceptions can be made, Charities in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Australia will be defaulted to using PayPal to process Donations made through the Services. The manner in which transactions are processed is explained below. Charities in other countries will be defaulted to using Adyen or Stripe.

A. PayPal.

i. Except as noted above, PayPal is the Payment Processor for Fundraisers with a Charity identified as a Beneficiary.

ii. In the United States, all Donations made through those Fundraisers will be accepted by PayPal Giving Fund, a grant-giving IRS-registered 501(c)(3) public charity. PayPal Giving Fund receives Donations from Users as the charity of record and then, to the extent it is able, grants Funds to the Charity selected by the Organizer and identified in the Fundraiser. While PayPal Giving Fund takes multiple steps to attempt to grant donated funds according to the Donor’s identified preference, PayPal Giving Fund retains exclusive control over all Donations. If a Charity fails to meet the terms of PayPal Giving Fund’s Nonprofit Certification Policy and/or fails to meet PayPal Giving Fund’s due diligence standards for receipt of a donation at any time, PayPal Giving Fund may reassign the funds in accordance with its policy [here](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/givingfund/policies/donation-delivery-policy). When PayPal Giving Fund receives your Donation, it will forward the Donation to the Charity of your choice, but PayPal Giving Fund will appear on your tax receipt. Donations made through PayPal Giving Fund are governed by the [Privacy Policy and User Agreement of PayPal Giving Fund and PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/givingfund/policies).

iii. PayPal Giving Fund has foreign counterparts, which are also registered charities in those countries. For example, if an Organizer in the United Kingdom starts a Fundraiser for a Charity in the United Kingdom, then PayPal will act as the Payment Processor with PayPal Giving Fund UK receiving the Donations.  Thereafter, PayPal Giving Fund UK will grant funds to the Charity identified in the Fundraiser, to the extent it is able, and it will issue country dependent tax documentation for all Donations received through it.

B. Adyen or Stripe.  When Adyen or Stripe processes a Donation through the Services for a Charity, the Donation will go directly from the Donor to the Charity’s merchant account. Donations will appear on the Donor’s credit card statement under the name of the Charity to which the Donor contributed. For more information, see [Adyen Terms and Conditions](https://www.adyen.com/legal/terms-and-conditions-adyen-for-platforms/)or [Stripe’s services agreement](https://stripe.com/legal).

You acknowledge and agree that you may be subject to third-party terms associated with including such products or services in your Fundraiser.  GoFundMe has relationships with certain providers of such products and services, and we may be paid by such providers in the form of commissions in connection with these products and services.

INDEMNITY AND RELEASE

Subject to applicable law, You agree to release, indemnify on demand and hold GoFundMe and its affiliates and their officers, employees, directors and agents harmless from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, awards, fines, damages, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Services, any Donation or Fundraiser, any User Content, your connection to the Services, your violation of these Terms of Service or your violation of any rights of another. You agree that GoFundMe has the right to conduct its own defense of any claims at its own discretion, and that you will indemnify GoFundMe for the costs of its defense (including, but not limited to attorney’s fees). If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him or her would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction—in or outside of the United States—you waive any comparable statute or doctrine to the extent permitted by law.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ,THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER GOFUNDME NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY: (I) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; (II) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS; (III) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL; (IV) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE; (V) LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA; OR (VI) OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF GOFUNDME HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (A) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES; (C) ANY PROMOTIONS AND RELATED PRIZES OR REWARDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (E) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES; OR (F) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GOFUNDME’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES (INCLUDING CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STATUTORY LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID GOFUNDME IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR, IF GREATER, ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$ 100).

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICES.

DISPUTES – USERS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA

ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Arbitration; Class Action Waiver: YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

The Process: Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms of Service. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/).

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Our current address for Notice is: GoFundMe, ℅ Legal Department, PO Box 121270, 815 E Street, San Diego, CA, 92101, United States. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to work with you and make a good faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we are not successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (b) US$10,000.00.

Fees: If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. If the arbitration finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

No Class Actions: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

Modifications to this Arbitration Provision: If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with us will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

Enforceability: If this Disputes section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the General section below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.

Confidentiality: We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by law enforcement or any court or governmental body. However, we may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers.

TERMINATION  
You agree that GoFundMe, in response to concerns of fraudulent or illegal activity or a material breach of these Terms of Service may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data at any time, and to the extent permitted by applicable law without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom.

USER DISPUTES  
You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other User in connection with the Services and GoFundMe will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. GoFundMe reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other User of the Services.

GENERAL

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and GoFundMe and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and GoFundMe with respect to the Services. You also may be subject to additional terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. 

For Users in the United Kingdom, European Economical Area and Switzerland, these Terms of Service and any dispute arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services are governed as set out above under “Disputes – Users In the UK, European Economical Area and Switzerland”.  For all other Users, these Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and GoFundMe agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Mateo County, California. 

The failure of GoFundMe to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that save where contractual restrictions of the term for bringing a claim are expressly prohibited by applicable law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of GoFundMe, but GoFundMe may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. If we fail to enforce any of our rights, that does not result in a waiver of that right. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. To the extent permitted by applicable law, notices to you may be made via email or regular mail. The Services may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Platform. GoFundMe may, at any time, assign our rights or delegate our obligations hereunder without notice to you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of equity or assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall prevent GoFundMe from complying with the law. Except to the extent provided otherwise under applicable law,  GoFundMe shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war or threats of war, terrorism or threats of terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, governmental regulation or advisory, recognized health threats, as determined by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, or local government authority or health agencies, strikes or shortages or curtailment of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
