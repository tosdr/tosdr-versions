We and third parties use cookies and other tracking technologies to understand how you use the Services and facilitate serving relevant ads. This helps us determine if you have seen an ad before, tailor ads to you, including based on your activities on and off the services, and avoid showing you duplicate ads. See our [Cookie Notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/cookie-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_56&itid=lk_inline_manual_53) for more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies and for your cookie choices, including how to opt out of personalized advertising.

Some of this information is combined with information collected across different websites, online services, and other linked or associated devices. We try to limit how our third parties can use the information they gather from you or that we provide. However, some advertising and analytics vendors combine information they gather about you through our Services with information they receive from others in order to target ads to you across other services and to improve their own services. Our [Cookie Notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/cookie-policy/) provides more information about how these technologies are used.

* **Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction.** We also disclose information about you to third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.

We also disclose other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated data about how users are using our Services.

**Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information or Sharing or Processing of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia Residents Only).**

Advertisement

If you are a California, Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah or Virginia resident, you may opt out of certain processing of your personal information, including for targeted advertising, under applicable law. Targeted advertising is when we or our partners display ads to you based on your personal information that is collected across different businesses.

We and our advertising partners collect certain information from our visitors, such as device identifiers, cookies, advertising IDs, IP addresses and usage activity. We and our ad partners share this information with third parties or combine it with information from other businesses to deliver more relevant (targeted) ads to you and for related advertising activities. We may also share or use hashed contact information for this purpose. This activity is known as “sharing” or processing your personal information for targeted ads and may be considered “selling” your personal information under applicable law.

If you (or in applicable states, your authorized agent) would like to opt out of our use or disclosure of your information for such purposes, you can follow the steps at [Your Privacy Choices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/my-post/privacy-settings?itid=lk_inline_manual_102). Note, if you use a cookie blocker such as Ghostery, it may block visibility of this tool or link, including in your web footer. See our [Cookie Notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/cookie-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_102) for more information about how we use cookies and other choices you have.

Even if you opt out, you will still see advertising, it just may be less relevant to you, or it may be personalized for you based only on the data that the Washington Post has collected about you. Unless you sign in, you must opt out on each device and each browser where you want your choice to apply. Your preference may be lost if you clear, or your browser is set to clear, cookies. If you have enabled a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal (such as Global Privacy Control) on your browser, we recognize such preference in accordance and to the extent required by applicable law. You will need to turn this on for each browser you use unless you sign into your Washington Post account.

**Analytics.** Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms. For example, you may opt out of having [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) use your information for analytics by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You can visit our [Cookie Notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/cookie-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_81&itid=lk_inline_manual_105) for additional information on how to opt out of certain analytics providers.

**Targeted Advertising**. In addition to other choices outlined above, our [Cookie Notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/cookie-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_82&itid=lk_inline_manual_106) has information about how to manage cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to personalized advertising. You may choose whether to receive certain targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, other service providers or entities by visiting websites operated by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). These third-party tools may have limitations such as the browsers on which they are effective. Many mobile devices also allow you to opt-out of certain personalized advertising for mobile apps and related tracking using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile device settings.

_**Jurisdiction-Specific Privacy Information**_

_**Additional Information for California Residents**_

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide you with some additional information. Depending on how you use the Services:

* We collect, use, and disclose for our business and commercial purposes, the following categories of information about you or your use of the Services:
    * Identifiers (such as name, address, email address); commercial information (such as transaction data); financial data (such as credit card information); user-generated content; device information and identifiers (such as IP address); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing history or app usage); professional and employment related information; location data; audio or visual information (such as if you participate in a phone survey or submit a photo); demographic data (such as gender); inference data; and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.
    * Please see [Information We Collect](https://www.washingtonpost.com/privacy-policy/#INFORMATIONWECOLLECT) above for more information
* We use the above categories of information:
    * to provide and manage the Services you request; to contact you; to deliver advertising; to better understand our readers and users and improve our Services; for bug detection and error reporting; to audit consumer interactions on the Services; to protect the rights of the Services and with your consent.
    * Please see How We Use Information above for more information.
* We disclose
    * any of the above categories of information we collect with: our affiliates; business partners to provide you with services that you request; service providers; other parties, including government entities, when required by law or to protect our users and services; social media services pursuant to that service and your settings; and with your consent or in connection with a corporate transaction.
    * commercial information and financial data, including your payment information, with payment processors and service providers, and
    * device information and identifiers and internet or other network or device activity with entities that provide content, advertising, and functionality.
    * Please see How We Disclose Information above for more information.

**Sale or sharing of personal information**_._ We engage in targeted (or cross context behavioral) advertising on the Services or on other sites and when we advertise our Services elsewhere. In connection with such advertising, we may share the following categories of information with advertising networks and providers, advertisers, and social media networks, which may be considered a sale under California law and is the processing of personal information for targeted advertising:

* device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; hashed identifiers such as contact information, usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; location information, such as city; and inference data.

California residents can opt out of such targeted advertising as set forth here: [Your Privacy Choices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/my-post/privacy-settings/?itid=lk_inline_manual_103&itid=lk_inline_manual_100&itid=lk_inline_manual_122). California residents can also turn on the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information that is browser based for each participating browser system that you use. Learn more at the [Global Privacy Control website](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).

**Right to Limit.** The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information as defined by the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA.

**Retention.** We keep your information to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. Our retention is based upon the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes. If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to honor your opt out. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law.

We received the following requests to know and requests to delete from California consumers and other individuals from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023:

|     |     | Average number of days  <br>to complete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Requests to Know Received** | 38  |     |
| Completed | 9   | 37.4 |
| Incomplete  <br>(due to lack of verification or confirmation of request) | 29  | N/A |
| **Requests to Delete Received** | 7040 |     |
| Completed | 2515 | 29.5 |
| Incomplete (due to lack of verification or confirmation of request) | 4525 | N/A |

We received approximately the following number of requests to opt out from California consumers from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023:

|     |     | Average number  <br>of days to complete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CCPA Requests to Opt Out\*** |     |     |
| Completed | 3980 | <1  |
| Incomplete | N/A | N/A |

\*Number of requests to opt out is approximate due to certain technical limitations and because certain requests are made through third party tools.

Once a year, California residents can also request certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

California residents who are under 18 and registered users of the Services can request removal of content that they have posted on the Services by emailing us at [comments@washpost.com](mailto:comments@washpost.com) with your name and email address and/or your Washington Post username, birth year, mailing address, and the material that you want removed and information that will enable us to locate it, and the subject line “California Removal Request”. Your request does not ensure complete removal of the material. For example, materials may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.

**Do Not Track.** Some web browsers may transmit a “do-not-track” signal. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning how to treat such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to do not track signals. We respond to legally recognized browser-based opt out signals such as the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal for California residents.

_**Nevada Residents**_

Nevada consumers who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” as such terms are defined under Nevada law. We do not engage in such activity, but if you have questions about this you can email us at [privacy@washpost.com](mailto:privacy@washpost.com).

_**Additional Information for Certain Users Outside the United States**_

Under applicable law in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, the Washington Post is considered the “data controller” of the personal information we handle under this Policy. In other words, The Washington Post is responsible for deciding how to collect, use and disclose this information, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears at the end of this Policy. Residents of certain jurisdictions may be able to request one or more individual rights set forth in “Individual Rights” below under applicable law.

**International Transfers.** The Services are headquartered in the United States, where we process and store information. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. We will ensure that transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization are subject to appropriate safeguards. By using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law. Our [Data Privacy Framework Policy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/data-privacy-framework-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_139) governs use of personal information transferred to us from organizations in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland under such transfer mechanism.

_**Users in the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland**_

**Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing.** We process personal data consistent with our disclosures in this Privacy Policy. We process personal data on the following legal bases: (1) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Services to you; (2) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing the Services where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms related to data privacy; or (3) with your consent.

If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.

**Additional Marketing & Advertising Choices.**

Our [Cookies Notice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/cookie-policy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_136&itid=lk_inline_manual_145) has information about how to manage cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to personalized advertising.

If you are a resident of the EEA, UK, Switzerland, or Canada, as described above, you may opt out of (withdraw your consent to) receiving marketing emails from us by following the instructions in such emails. You may also opt out of (withdraw your consent to) our use of your email to provide you special offers via email and through other platforms (such as social media) by completing our [webform](https://thewashingtonpost.formstack.com/forms/email_marketing_request) here.

_**Data Security**_

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help protect the information we collect. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our systems, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

_**Children’s Privacy**_

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

_**Changes to this Privacy Policy**_

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of changes by posting changes here, or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of information to us following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.

**For More Information**. Please contact us [here](https://helpcenter.washingtonpost.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000603931&itid=lk_inline_manual_146&itid=lk_inline_manual_156).
