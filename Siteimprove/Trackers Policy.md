Cookie Notice
=============

At Siteimprove, transparency about cookies matters. This Cookie Notice explains how Siteimprove collects and uses cookies and other tracking technologies on our website Siteimprove.com (the “Website”), and how you may manage your cookie preferences.

1\. Why Siteimprove uses cookies
--------------------------------

Siteimprove uses cookies and other tracking technologies to make sure that the Website can function, to manage website preferences, to measure statistics such as website traffic, and to support the marketing of our services.

2\. What are cookies and other tracking technologies?
-----------------------------------------------------

Cookies are small text files that the Website can place on your computer's hard drive, smartphone or other electronic equipment. However, the term "Cookies" in this Notice and consent also means other forms of automatic data collection, e.g., Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects), Web Storage (HTML5), Javascripts, tracking pixels or cookies set using other software. "Cookies" also includes IP and MAC address information and other information about your device. Cookies can be used by both Siteimprove and by third parties. Cookies enable the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. The primary information usually collected through cookies is statistical and technical information about equipment, and visitor actions on our website, such as:

* Traffic data 
* Location and IP address 
* Communication data 
* Operating System 
* Browser

Pixels, web beacons, and tags are types of code or transparent graphics that contain a unique identifier. These technologies provide analytical information about user experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In contrast to cookies, these technologies are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails.  A tracking pixel is a HTML code snippet which contains a unique identifier about a website visitor  and is used for tracking user behaviour on a website.

3\. Personal Data and Cookies
-----------------------------

Siteimprove’s use of Cookies may result in the processing of IP addresses, which in some instances may be considered Personal Data.

* For strictly necessary cookies, Siteimprove relies on the legitimate interest to maintain an fully operational website for marketing purposes. 
* For optional cookies, Siteimprove relies on your explicit consent to process your personal data, which you provide and manage through our cookie consent management platform. If you consent to optional marketing cookies, Siteimprove allows third parties such as advertisers to collect your personal data when browsing the Siteimprove website.

Please read Siteimprove’s [Privacy Policy](https://siteimprove.com/privacy/privacy-policy/ "Website Privacy Policy") which describes Siteimprove’s processing of Personal Data and your rights.

4\. How to manage Cookie consent
--------------------------------

When loading the Website for the first time, you are asked to select Cookie preferences. By default, only essential cookies are loaded. You may choose from the following options:

* By clicking on "Allow all cookies" in the cookie banner, you consent to Siteimprove using all Cookies as described in the table below. 
* By clicking on “Customize”, and then “Allow selection” in the cookie banner, you consent to Siteimprove using the selected categories of approved Cookies as described in the table below.
* By clicking on “Only necessary” in the cookie banner, you opt-out of all non-necessary Cookies as described in the table below.

You may at any time withdraw consent or change your Cookie settings by clicking on the Cookie settings icon, which is located on the bottom left corner of your screen, and select “Withdraw your consent” or “Change your consent”.

5\. What Cookies does Siteimprove use on the Website?
-----------------------------------------------------

Below you can see which Cookies the Website uses, for what purposes the individual Cookies are used, who sets the individual Cookie and how long Cookies are stored on your devices:
