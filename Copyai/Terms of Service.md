Terms of Service  

===================

‍**Last Updated: October 12th 2023**

Please read these Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) and our [Privacy Notice](#) (“**Privacy Notice**”) carefully because they govern your use of the CopyAI, Inc. (“**Copy.AI**”) website located at www.copy.ai (the “**Site**”), Copy.AI’s copy content generation services, and any copy content generated by Copy.AI’s services for you based on your User Content (defined below) (“**Generated Content**”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services, and the Generated Content are collectively called the “**Services**.”

**IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND COPY.AI THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY** [**SECTION 16**](https://copy.ai/terms-of-service#16) **“DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.**

**1\. Agreement to Terms.** By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.

**2\. Privacy Notice.** Please review our Privacy Notice, which also governs your use of the Services, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.

**3\. Changes to these Terms or the Services.** We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

**4\. Who May Use the Services?**

You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with Copy.AI, and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law.

For certain features of the Services you will need an account. It is important that you provide us with accurate, complete and current account information and keep this information up to date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your account. To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

**5\. Feedback.** We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“**Feedback**”). If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you.

**6\. Subscriptions.** Copy.AI requires payment of a fee for use of the Services (or certain portions thereof) and you agree to pay such fees.

**(a)** General. When you purchase a subscription for the Services (“**Subscription**”), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge you for such Subscription. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Subscription, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “**Payment Information**”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Subscription, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete the transaction related to your Subscription and to charge your payment method for the type of Subscription you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Subscription (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). By initiating a Subscription, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted or otherwise communicated to you. All payments for Subscriptions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars.

**(b)** Subscriptions. If you purchase a Subscription, you will be charged the annual Subscription fee, plus any applicable taxes, and other charges (“**Subscription Fee**”), at the beginning of your Subscription and each year thereafter, at the then-current Subscription Fee. BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU AUTHORIZE COPY.AI TO INITIATE RECURRING NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS AS SET FORTH BELOW. If you purchase a Subscription, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you each year on the anniversary of the commencement of your Subscription, using the Payment Information you have provided until you cancel your Subscription. No less than thirty (30) days and no more than sixty (60) days before your Subscription term ends, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law, Copy.AI will send you a reminder with the then-current Subscription Fee. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Copy.AI. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or Subscription in accordance with these Terms.

**(c)** Cancelling Your Subscription. You may cancel your Subscription for a full refund within five (5) calendar days of your initial purchase. AFTER THAT, YOUR PURCHASE IS FINAL AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CANCEL THE PURCHASE AND/OR RECEIVE A REFUND OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE AT ANY TIME. But if something unexpected happens in the course of completing a transaction, we reserve the right to cancel your transaction for any reason; if we cancel your transaction we will refund any payment you have already remitted to us for such transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, you may cancel your Subscription at any time, but please note that such cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PURCHASE, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. To cancel, you can send an email to [cancel@copy.ai](mailto:cancel@copy.ai). You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current Subscription period. If you cancel, your right to use the Services will continue until the end of your then current Subscription period and will then terminate without further charges.

**(d)** Free Trials. We may offer to certain qualifying users paid Subscriptions on a free trial basis (“**Free Trial**”) for a specified period of time. If we offer you a Free Trial, the specific terms of your Free Trial will be provided at signup. Your use of the Free Trial is subject to your compliance with such specific terms. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining Free Trials with any other offers. Except as may otherwise be provided in the specific terms for the Free Trial offer, Free Trials are only available to users who have not previously held a paid Subscription. When you agree to a Free Trial, you are also agreeing to sign up for a paid Subscription as described above and, consequently, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your Free Trial, we (or our third party payment processor) will begin charging your payment method on a recurring annual basis for the applicable annual fee (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) at the end of the Free Trial until you cancel your Subscription. If you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Information, you must cancel your Subscription prior to midnight Eastern Time on the last day of your Free Trial period. Instructions for cancelling your subscription are stated in the section above titled “Canceling Your Subscription.”

**7\. Your Content.**

**(a)** Posting Content. Our Services may allow you to store or share content such as text (in posts or communications with others), files, documents, graphics, images, music, software, audio and video. Anything (other than Feedback) that you post or otherwise make available through the Services is referred to as “**User Content**.” Copy.AI does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to your User Content.

**(b)** Permissions to Your User Content. By making any User Content available through the Services you hereby grant to Copy.AI, its licensors, and their affiliates a non-exclusive, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license, with the right to sublicense, to use, host, store, copy, communicate, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publish, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with Copy.AI, its licensors, and their affiliate providing, operating, securing, and improving their services.

**(c)** Your Responsibility for User Content. You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you have (and will have) all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by Copy.AI on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

**(d)** Removal of User Content. You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. You should know that in certain instances, some of your User Content, (such as posts or comments you make), may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.

**(e)** Your Use of Generated Content. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Copy.AI hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, sell, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform Generated Content for your lawful business purposes.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

**(d)** Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

**(e)** Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

**(f)** Class Action Waiver. **YOU AND COPY.AI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

**(g)** Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(f) of these Terms (“**Class Action Waiver**”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.
