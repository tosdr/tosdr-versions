All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard Personal Data relating to you consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.  If our use of the Personal Data is governed by laws restricting the transfer of personal information to other countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection to the Personal Data, we will use appropriate safeguards, in particular, by way of entering into appropriate contractual agreements with the relevant recipients, or by adhering to equivalent data transfer regulations to protect the security and confidentiality of such personal information.

When we transfer Personal Data from outside of the US, we make use of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to receive personal data transfers from the European Union/European Economic Area to the U.S. (see “EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Notice” section below), and the standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission, to safeguard the transfer of information we collect from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (the "UK"), and Switzerland.

8\. **Data Privacy Framework Notice**
-------------------------------------

Copy.ai complies with the principles of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and relies on the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. DPF to receive personal data transfers from the European Economic Area. Copy.ai adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“EU-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Copy.ai. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the “DPF Principles”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Under the DPF Principles we are responsible for the processing of personal data we receive and, subsequently, for the personal data that we then transfer to a third-party service provider, if the personal data is processed in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework.

If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our compliance with the DPF Principles, we encourage you to contact us under the contact details set forth in the “Contact Us” section below. In this section you can also find information regarding our EU representative that can respond to your inquiries or complaints.

If you have an unresolved complaint regarding our handling of personal data we received in reliance on the Data Privacy Framework, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge), JAMS, at [https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution).

Finally, if you have a complaint that we have violated the DPF Principles that has not been resolved by other means, you may have the ability to invoke binding arbitration as outlined more fully on the  Data Privacy Framework website.

Copy.ai is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

10\. **Specific provision for EEA, UK and Swiss residents**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Under the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (“**GDPR**”), we are considered a data controller with respect to the Services we provide to you, or with respect to the information you provide us as a job candidate. If you are a resident of a territory in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), the United Kingdom orSwitzerland, we base our processing of Personal Data as a data controller on the following lawful grounds:

* Performance of a contract with you when we provide and maintain our Services. When we process your account information, Content, and technical information solely to provide our Services to you, this information is necessary to be able to provide our Services. If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to provide our Services to you. 
* Our legitimate interests in protecting our Services from abuse, fraud, or security risks, or in developing,     improving, or promoting our Services. This may include the processing of account information, Content, and Technical Information.

* You are entitled to request to delete or restrict access to Personal Data related to you in limited circumstances as described under the GDPR, subject to certain exceptions. If we need to delete Personal Data related to you following your request, it can take time until we completely delete residual copies of Personal Data related to you from our active servers, from our backup systems, and from third-parties (as     described in section 4).

If you exercise one (or more) of the above-mentioned rights, in accordance with the provisions under applicable law, you are entitled to request to be informed that third parties that hold Personal Data related to you, in accordance with this privacy policy, will act accordingly.

11\. **U.S. State Law Disclosures**
-----------------------------------

Several U.S. states have enacted privacy laws to grant new privacy rights to their residents.

To the extent provided for by local law and subject to applicable exceptions, individuals may have privacy rights in relation to their Personal Data including the following:

·      Access their information 

·      Correct their inaccurate information

·      Opt out if a business “sells” their information, uses or shares it for certain advertising purposes, or profiles them to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects

·      Be notified about a business’s data practices

·      Nondiscrimination for exercising their privacy rights

The following table provides additional information about the categories of Personal Data we collect and how we disclose that information.

We don’t “sell” Personal Data or “share” Personal Data for cross-contextual behavioral advertising (as those terms are defined under applicable local law). We also don’t process sensitive Personal Data for the purposes of inferring characteristics about a consumer.

12\. **Children’s Information**

13\. **Data Retention And Deletion**
------------------------------------

We retain different types of Personal Data for different periods, depending on the purposes for processing such information, our legitimate business purposes as well as pursuant to legal requirements under the applicable laws.  

We will maintain your contact details, to help us stay in contact with you. At any time before or after the termination of the Services, you can contact our privacy team at: legal@copy.ai, and request to delete your contact details.

In any case, as long as you use the Services, we will keep information about you, unless applicable law requires us to delete it.

14\. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

From time to time, we will need to update this privacy policy. If the updates have minor, if any, consequences, they will take effect 7 days after we post a notice on the Services’ platform and/or our website, or after we send you the notice through email or through the Services. Substantial changes will be effective 30 days after we initially posted our notice. Changes to this privacy policy are effective as of the stated “last updated” date.
