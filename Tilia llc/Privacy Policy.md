**Last Updated: September 29, 2022**

Tilia LLC and its affiliates (collectively “**Tilia**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”) respect the privacy of its online visitors and users of its websites, apps, products and services, including the services accessible within third-Party Platforms and Publishers (each term as defined in our [Terms of Services](https://tilia.io/legal/tos)) (collectively, the “**Services**”).  

We recognize the importance of protecting information collected from our users and have adopted this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we gather, use, store, disclose, and otherwise process your information, including personal information (also known as personal data), in conjunction with your access and use of our Services.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.  [](https://www.tilia.io/legal/privacy-policy#section-13)

**1\. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT**
-------------------------------------------------------------

We collect two types of information – “personal information” and “anonymous information” – which we may use to create a third type of information, “aggregate information”.  

* “**Personal Information**”, also often referred to as “**Personal Data**”, means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, household, or device, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, username, and/or image.  
* “**Anonymous Information**” means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual, household, or device.  
* “**Aggregate Information**” means information about groups or categories of individuals which does not identify, and cannot reasonably be used, to identify an individual, household, or device.  We may share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with other parties without restriction.

**Information You Provide**

We collect the information which you provide us which may include:

* **Registration or Account Information**. Information you provide when you register to use our Services or create an account such as: your first name and last name, country of residence, date of birth, e-mail address, username and password.    
      
    Not all information will be mandatory to create the account or register to use the Services, for example we do not ask you to provide sensitive information or special category data (such as that regarding your race, ethnicity, religious beliefs or sexual orientation).  However, if you opt to provide more information, please note that this may become publicly available depending on its nature and why it was provided (e.g. your image for your account profile photo).  

* **Identity and KYC Information.** When you use certain of our Services, including when accessed through a Publisher’s Platform, we will need to confirm your identity to comply with applicable laws.  To do this, we require that you provide us with information commonly referred to as “KYC” or “Know Your Client” information.  Which KYC information is required differs depending on which law applies but generally, the information that may be required includes your name, date of birth, social security number, address, email address, phone number, photo of an ID document (such as a passport or government-issued photo identification), and card details.      
* **Purchase and Transaction Information**. When using our Services to conduct transactions, including through a Publisher’s Platform, we may collect and retain some or all of the information related to these transactions, including payment details, transaction amount(s), parties involved, time and manner of exchange, the IP address of where the transaction is originating, and other transaction circumstances, such as payment method and names or emails of external third-party accounts (for example, PayPal or Skrill).
* **Your Marketing Preferences**. We like to keep in touch with our users and future users through different communications such as emails.  To ensure you find these communications useful, we ask you for your marketing preferences which may include your personal information.    
* **Surveys, Contests and Promotions**. As part of our Services, we sometimes offer or ask you to take part in surveys, contests, or promotions.  Depending on the nature of the survey, contest, or promotion, we may ask you, or you may volunteer, to provide certain personal information, such as your name, address or opinion.
* **When you do Business with us**. If you are a vendor, service provider, or business partner (or a prospective vendor, service provider or business partner) of us, we may collect information about you and the services you provide, including your or your employees’ business contact information and other information you or your employees provide to us as part of the services you may provide and our agreement with you.
* **Communications**. We collect information you provide when you contact us, for example regarding customer support inquiries or other inquiries related to your account, or to provide us with feedback on the Services.  

**Information We Collect Automatically**

When using our Services, in addition to the information you provide us, there is also some information we may collect automatically that identifies you or the device you are using to access the Service, such as your computer or mobile device.  Generally, this information relates to your use of the Services and your preferences, such as the types of Services you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the people or accounts you interact with, and the time, frequency and duration of your activities.  In addition, we may also collect location information when you use the Services, including geolocation information or your internet protocol (IP) address.

For more information on this, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://tilia.io/legal/cookies-policy).

**Information We Receive From Third Parties**

* Publishers can also create accounts on your behalf if you use one of our Services on their Platform and when they do this, they will provide certain information to us such as your first name and last name, country of residence, date of birth, e-mail address, username and password.  You will know when this happens as you will be prompted to review our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
* When verifying your identity, we may use the services of third parties for all or part of the process.  As part of doing so, the third party may provide information about you such as credit history and credit information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the information provided throughout this Privacy Policy, there are certain other pieces of information we are required by law in the EU and UK to provide you.  

**Controller**

The controller of your personal information is Tilia LLC of 945 Battery Street San Francisco, CA 94111.  

**Processor**    

With respect to some of the personal information and processing described above, we will act as a processor of your personal information as opposed to a controller.  This is when we are only processing your personal information on behalf of a Publisher; this generally occurs when you access our Services through a Publisher’s Platform and we do not need to process the personal data for our own purposes.  An example of processing for our own purposes is performing KYC checks.

When we do act as a processor, certain details in this Privacy Policy will not apply to you; most importantly, if we process your personal information as a processor, you may not be able exercise the rights listed in “_Your Controls, Rights and Choices_” directly to us.  You can, however, exercise them with the controller of your personal data which will most likely be a Publisher whose Platform you use.  

If you have any questions regarding our role as a processor, you can get in touch using the contact details in section “_Comments and Questions_”.

**Your Rights**

For information on the rights exercisable by EU or UK individuals, and details on how to exercise them, please see section “_Your Controls, Rights and Choices_”.

**International Transfers**

As an organisation operating globally, we may be required to transfer your personal information to countries other than that from which it was collected.  Whenever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information in accordance with applicable law.  In particular, when transferring personal information from the EU or UK, we will either only transfer your personal information to a country which has been deemed by the European Commission or the UK data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, to be adequate or we will ensure the following appropriate measures are in place so your personal information is treated by the recipients in a way that is equivalent to, and which respects, the EU and UK laws on data protection and your rights as an EU or UK data subject.  These include:

* the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to the GDPR, as may be amended or replaced from time to time (the “EU Clauses”); and
* standard data protection clauses specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State under section 17C(b) of the 2018 Data Protection Act and for the time being in force in the United Kingdom (the “UK Clauses”).

Where necessary, we may also further supplement the EU Clauses and/or UK Clauses with additional measures specific to a relevant transfer, such as increased security.  If you require further information about either the EU Clauses or the UK Clauses, or the other protective measures in place, please contact us using the details provided in section “_Comments and Questions_”.

**Lawful Basis for Processing**

We will only collect, use, process and store your personal information where we have a valid lawful basis.  Our lawful bases include:

* Consent (you have given us consent);
* Performance of a contract (our processing is necessary for the performance of a contract we have with you or to take specific steps before entering into a contract with you.  This may be, for example, a contract to receive Services from us);
* Legal obligation (processing is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory authorities, court orders or law enforcement requests, for example to perform KYC checks); and
* Legitimate interests (processing is necessary for ours, or a third party’s, legitimate interests.  The legitimate interests pursued by us are improving our business or customer relationships, marketing and advertising, resolving disputes, identifying and preventing fraud and abuse, analysing and improving safety and security of our Services, enforcing our Terms of Service.  You have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests).

**Retention**

We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.  We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.  For example, we retain your personal information while each of your accounts is in existence or as needed to provide you with Services.  

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

**7\. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., THE EU OR THE UK**

In certain jurisdictions, we will need your explicit consent to obtain, process and share your personal information.  All such processing will be carried out in line with this Privacy Policy.  To the extent required, your use of the Services will be deemed your explicit consent to obtain, process and share your personal information.  If you do not wish to provide us such consent, you should cease using the Services immediately and contact us using the contact details provided in section “_Comments and Questions_”.
