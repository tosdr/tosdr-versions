Love Energy Savings Terms & Conditions
======================================

1.     Introduction
-------------------

* We provide Customers with Our Services for their Business Utilities. The Quotations We provide depend upon the Products available to Us and the Suppliers We work with, along with whether the Customer meets the relevant Supplier Criteria. We do not provide advice and Customers are required to make their own decision as to which Quotation they wish to pursue, if any. We have a selection of Partners that can assist Customers and Consumers. We can transfer Customers and Consumers (in line with Our Privacy Policy) to the relevant Partner, for them to provide a comparison for their specific product/service.
* We are not responsible for the performance of Our Partners, Our Suppliers and/or their services. For the terms and conditions of Our Partners’ or Our Suppliers’ services, you should refer to Our Partners or Our Suppliers terms and conditions and ensure that you are happy with them before proceeding.

2.   Key Information About Our Terms
------------------------------------

* * The provisions contained in these terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of any of Our Services and Our Websites. It is important you read these Terms carefully, as they set out the full extent of Our obligations and liabilities. The Terms supersede any previous agreements between Us and yourself. These Terms are governed by the laws of England and any disputes will be decided by the English Courts only.
    * Any failure by Us to enforce any of Our rights under these Terms or provided by law is not to be taken as or deemed to be a waiver of enforceability, and We reserve these rights.
    * We may transfer Our rights under these terms to another business without your consent, but we will notify You of the transfer and make sure that Your rights are not adversely affected as a result. These Terms are binding on a Customer’s and Consumer’s successor.
    * If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, this will not impact the validity of remaining provisions, which remain in full force and effect.
    * We may amend these Terms from time to time. We will provide notice of the amendments, by updating the Terms available on Our Websites and/or contacting Customers and Consumers. By using Our Websites and Our Services, you accept Our Terms (including acceptance that any future amendments made are incorporated into the Terms) and Our Privacy Policy. For further information on how We process personal data, including carry out Our marketing, please refer to Our Privacy Policy.
    * If there are any queries or concerns about Our Terms, please get in touch with Us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.energyhelpline.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and We will be happy to assist you. If We get things wrong, We encourage you to let us know without delay. This enables Us to work with you to attempt put things right as soon as We can. Our complaint process is available on Our Websites. As soon as you become aware of your reason to raise a complaint, you must contact Us without delay (and in any event, no later than 3 months from when you became aware of a reason to complain).
    * We are a member of the Energy Ombudsman’s independent dispute resolution scheme, and Our registration number is C35LOVE01. For complaints relating to Our energy Services, if we are unable to resolve your complaint within 8 weeks of you raising your concerns, you may be able to use the Energy Ombudsman’s services.

3.   Our Services
-----------------

* * Our Services are provided to Customers and Consumers as they have expressed an interest in Our Service, and We have agreed to provide Our Services. We may use Our discretion and reserve the right to refuse or terminate Our Services to a Customer or Consumer.
    * Our Services depend upon:
        * The Products available to Us;
        * The Suppliers and Partners We work with; and,
        * Whether the Customer meets the relevant Supplier Criteria.
    * We do not act on a Customer’s behalf other than under the specific authority granted in line with a signed Letter of Authority by the Customer.
    * For Our energy Business Utilities, We work with a panel of Suppliers. For Our other Business Utilities, We work with either one or a small panel of Suppliers. For Our Services, we do not compare the full relevant market.
    * For terms and conditions relation to Our promotions please click here.

4.   Comparison Service
-----------------------

* * We will use reasonable endeavours to negotiate and secure competitive prices for Customers. Quotations are provided by Us in good faith, on the basis the Details given to Us by the Customer are correct, complete, and current. If the Details do not satisfy these requirements, it will impact upon the accuracy and validity of the Quotations and Contract.
    * We and Our Suppliers reserve the right to amend or withdraw any Quotations without notice at any time. The Quotation provided does not constitute an offer. The Customer agreeing to the Contract is the Customer agreeing to an offer. Dependent on the Supplier and the type of Customer, the offer agreed may be non-revocable. Whether the offer is or is not revocable will generally be contained within the terms and conditions of the Contract. The Contract will be held directly between the Customer and the Supplier.
    * The provision of Our Comparison Services can occur via Our Websites or via Our call centres. Where Our Comparison Services occur via Our Call Centre, this will result in a reduced comparison of Product being delivered to the Customer, given the nature and the manner of the comparison. The Comparison Service provided will be restricted to Products based on the Details provided and some potential other options which the Customer may be interested in.

5.   Switching Service
----------------------

* * If the Customer chooses to proceed after reviewing a Quotation, the Customer will need to complete a Contract (verbally, electronically or physically) which We will facilitate. Our Switching Service aims to make the change to your new Contract as smooth as possible, by using Our reasonable endeavours to get the Contract Live. We are not responsible for any delay by the Supplier or Current Supplier, and We must be allowed reasonable time to carry out Our processes which form part of Our Switching Service.
    * Following on from the completion of the Contract by the Customer, We will carry out the Checks required prior to the Contract being Processed to the Supplier. The Checks completed by Us are based on the Details provided. If the Contract is unable to be Processed as it does not meet the requirements for the Checks, We will look to contact the Customer.
    * Once the Contract has been Processed to the Supplier, the Customer will receive Our Welcome Pack. If Our Welcome Pack contains a Letter of Authority, it is incredibly important the Customer signs this Letter of Authority without delay. The Letter of Authority provides Us with the ability to provide Our Switching Service and, where possible and required, allows us to serve Termination of the Customer’s Current Supplier contract.
    * Even though We carry out Checks prior to a Contract being Processed, Suppliers reserve the right to carry out additional checks (Supplier Checks). This can mean a Contract has been Processed by Us but is not accepted by the Supplier. Suppliers reserve the right to not accept a Customer’s Contract and may use their sole discretion to reject a Customer’s Contract. If this occurs, We will endeavour to contact the Customer as soon as possible.
    * Suppliers might be in a position where a Contract can be accepted, however, they might require an amendment to the Contract or further information from the Customer. If this occurs, We will endeavour to contact the Customer as soon as possible.
    * Throughout the Customer’s wait for a Contract to go Live, they should receive updates on their Contract via Track My Switch.

6.   How We Get Paid
--------------------

* * We are proud of the value Our Service provides to Customers and we strongly believe we charge a fair Fee for Our Service. The Fee earned by Us balances the cost to provide Our Services, in line with providing good customer outcomes and retaining Our standing within the market to continue to provide Customers with competitive deals for their Business Utilities. Customers and Consumers not required to make any direct payment to Us for Our Services. By agreeing to use Our Services, Customers and Consumers are agreeing for Us to receive this remuneration for Our Services as set out below. If a Customer or Consumer would like to find out the Fee that We expect to receive from their Contract please email contact Us or visit Our dedicated How We Get Paid Page.
    * Some Suppliers may make additional payments to Us, e.g., a nominal payment per meter/customer sold successfully to that Supplier. The nature and value of these additional payments may vary based on Product, Supplier and in the future. However, these payments do not impact the impartiality of Our Services.

Energy

* We receive a Fee for Our Service directly from the Supplier when an energy Contract procured via Us goes Live. The Fee is included within the Customer’s unit cost of energy usage as pence per kWh, by way of a small uplift to the Customer’s unit rate. Because Our Fee is based on Estimated Annual Energy Consumption, at the point the Customer agrees a Contract the Fee amount is an estimate. The calculation for Our Fee is uplift multiplied by the Estimated Annual Energy Consumption and multiplied by the Contract term.
* Due to the way We are remunerated, We only offer business energy prices from the Suppliers who are live on Our panel, rather than the whole market. Because Our Fee is based on Estimated Annual Energy Consumption, they are forecast amounts.

Water

* We receive a Fee from Our Partner for the introduction of Customers to their service. This is included within the cost of the Customer’s water retail service fee by way of a small uplift applied to usage over the life of the Contract, which therefore would be included within the cost of the Contract the Customer agrees via Us.

Telecoms

* We receive a retail introduction fee directly from Our telecoms Partners for the introduction of a Customer to their telecoms services. The fee is paid per telecoms Contract and the amount may vary dependant on the package taken.

Other

* For Customers and Consumers who are interested in other services, we transfer them (in line with Our Privacy Policy) to the relevant Partner, for the Partner to provide a comparison for the specific product/service (“**Referral Services**”), we are paid by Our Partner.
