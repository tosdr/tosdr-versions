Cookie & Ad Policy
------------------

_Last Updated: March 28th, 2023_

### Overview

Canary Connect, Inc. (“Canary”) uses cookies and other technologies on our website, mobile applications, electronic communications, advertisements, and other online services (collectively, the "Services") for a number of purposes, including: authenticating users, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic, mobile app features and trends, and generally understanding the online and mobile behaviors and interests of people who interact with our Services.

Your continued use of our Services constitutes your consent to our use of these cookies and other technologies and to our use in accordance with this policy and our Privacy Policy.

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small files containing an identifier that are stored on your browser or device.

There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain you are visiting are called “first party cookies.” Cookies served by companies that are not operating the domain you're visiting are called “third party cookies.”

Canary also uses other identification technologies, such as pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) which are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to read and place cookies or transmit information to us or our partners. The resulting connection can include information such as a device's IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser or device, and the type of browser being used. Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or app to store and retrieve data on a person's computer, mobile phone or other device. Some examples include device or HTML5 local storage and caching.

### Your Choices

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the "Help" or “Preferences” menu. Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link located on their website.

It is important to note that some cookies and other technologies is essential in providing the Services to you, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services.

Removing or rejecting cookies does not necessarily affect third-party flash cookies which may be used by us or our partners in connection with our Services. To delete or disable flash cookies please visit [this site](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) for more information. For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, you can visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

### Types and Purposes of Cookies

The following table sets out the different categories of cookies that our Services use and why we use them. The lists of third party cookie providers are intended merely as illustrative not comprehensive.

### Category

### Purpose

### 1\. Features and Services Cookies

We may use cookies and similar technologies to help us provide you and others with social plugins for social sharing and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others or providing you with customer support.  
[View Features and Services Cookies](#features-and-services)

### 2\. Analytics Cookies (Measurement Cookies)

Some cookies and tracking technologies are used to understand, improve, and research performance of our products and Services, including when you access the Canary website and related websites and apps from a computer or mobile device. For example, we may use cookies to understand how you are using site features or segmenting audiences for feature testing. We and our partners may use these technologies and the information we receive to improve and understand how you use websites, apps, products, services, and to provide you a tailored experience.  
[View Analytics Cookies](#analytics-and-research)

### 3\. Advertising Cookies (Marketing Cookies)

Cookies and pixels are used to deliver relevant ads, track ad campaign performance and efficiency. For example, we and our ad partners may rely on information gleaned through these cookies to serve you ads that may be interesting to you on other websites. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie attribution service or another similar technology to determine whether we've served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them.  
[View Advertising Cookies](#advertising)

### Canary Ads Placed on Third Party Ad Networks; Opt-Out Options

We use third parties to display advertisements on other websites. Through a process called “retargeting,” also known as “remarketing,” network advertisers place a cookie on your browser that allows us to show you ads on other websites based on your previous activity on our site.

Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.

These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy. We may provide these third party advertisers with information about your usage of our website and our services, as well as aggregate information about visitors to our website.

Our third party vendors, including Google, use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website. We also use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, to tailor advertisements relevant to you based on demographic information such as age, gender, and interests.

You may, however, opt-out of many third party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”). For more information regarding your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third party ad networks, please visit their respective websites: [www.networkadvertising.org/optout\_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) (NAI); [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (DAA) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (EDAA).

Opting out of one or more member networks only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.

### Third Party Ads Displayed on Canary’s Properties; Opt-Out Options

Our Services may display ads served by one or more of the third party advertising networks listed in the table below under the heading “Advertising Cookies (Marketing Cookies).” These advertising networks may in turn send information about your device to other ad networks or advertisers in order to deliver ads to your device. You may opt out of sharing some of your information to these networks and advertisers through your device settings. For iOS navigate to “Allow Apps to Request to Track” by following these [steps](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-app-tracking-permissions-iph4f4cbd242/ios), and for Android go to “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” by opening the **Settings** app and navigating to **Privacy > Ads**. If you do so, you will continue to see ads in our Services, however they may not be as relevant to you.
