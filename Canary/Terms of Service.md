### 12\. Our Limitation of Liability

Nothing in these Terms (including anything specified in this "Our Limitation of Liability" provision) shall attempt to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, IN NO CASE SHALL (A) CANARY, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING ANY CONTENT TO OR FROM THE SERVICE, EVEN IF CANARY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; (B) CANARY, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICE, EVEN IF CANARY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THEIR POSSIBILITY. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 13\. Termination

These Terms will remain in full force and effect so long as you continue to access or use the Services, or until terminated in accordance with the provisions of these Terms.

If in our sole judgment you fail, or we reasonably suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we may either (i) suspend your access to our Services (or any part thereof); or (ii) terminate this agreement at any time upon notice to you and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination.

### 14\. Other Terms

Canary controls and operates its Service from its headquarters in the United States and the Canary Content and products offered through the Service may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you use this Service outside the United States of America, you are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.

In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service. Such determination shall not affect the legality, validity, and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

A failure or delay by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). The headings used in these Terms are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.

The laws of the State of Delaware will govern these Terms of Service, without regard to conflicts of law principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods and Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.

Any and all claims and controversies arising out of and related to the Privacy Policy, our Sales Terms, and these Terms of Service shall be settled in the courts of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

Any such claim or controversy shall be adjudicated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with a claim of any other party. The foregoing shall not preclude Canary from seeking any injunctive or other equitable relief in courts of competent jurisdiction located in other countries and jurisdictions for protection of any Canary confidential information and intellectual property rights or to prevent loss of data or damage to its servers.

### 15\. Changes to These Terms
