    \- indirectly provided by its websites, such as:
2. traffic data registered by the servers that host our websites;
3. cookies, that may share some personal information.

Bitdefender may use other IT companies to process the collected personal data. These companies are considered data processors and have strict contractual obligations to keep the confidentiality of the processed data and to offer at least the same level of security as Bitdefender. Data processors have the obligation not to allow third parties to process personal data on behalf of Bitdefender and to access, use and/or keep the data secure and confidential.

Bitdefender may host personal data in the European Union or any other jurisdiction which offers adequate level of personal data protection according to European Union standards (art 45 GDPR) or other appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses (art 46.2 GDPR).
