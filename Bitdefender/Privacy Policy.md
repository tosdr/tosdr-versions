Privacy Policy for Bitdefender websites Version 4.0, adopted on 13.05.2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The document explains the personal data we collect, how and where we may use it, how we protect it, who has access to it, with whom we share it, and how you may correct it.

This privacy policy applies to the personal data collected by all websites or Internet accounts managed by Bitdefender. If you use our products and services, check our specific privacy policies if you use [Home or Business solutions.](https://www.bitdefender.com/site/view/legal-privacy.html)

**1\. General information**

S.C. BITDEFENDER S.R.L. (hereafter mentioned as Bitdefender), with its official headquarters in 15A Sos. Orhideelor, Orhideea Towers Building, 9-12 floors, 6th District, Bucharest, Romania, registered in the Bucharest Trade Register with number J40/20427/2005, fiscal code RO18189442, e-mail [\[email protected\]](https://www.bitdefender.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) processes personal data in agreement with the European legislation on data protection (GDPR – Regulation EU 2016/679). Our Data Protection Officer can be found at the following contacts: Bitdefender’s Data Protection Office – [\[email protected\]](https://www.bitdefender.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), Phone: 4021 -206.34.70

Bitdefender offers data security products and services. Our goal is to ensure information and network security by providing quality products and services in these areas while also respecting privacy and personal data of customers, Internet users and business partners.

For this purpose, we collect only that personal data necessary for the specified purposes, on a best efforts basis.

Personal data according to the European legislation definition (GDPR - Regulation 2016/679 means:

_any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;_

In this context, Bitdefender processes personal data for the following main purposes:

* Website management and security
* Responding to your queries and comments
* Marketing for Bitdefender own needs.
* Statistical analysis and market studies;

**2\. Personal data collected**

Bitdefender may collect personal information from its users in four different ways:

1. directly provided by a user;  
    \- indirectly provided by its websites, such as:
2. traffic data registered by the servers that host our websites;
3. cookies, that may share some personal information.

2.1. Personal data directly provided by a user – for example, when you complete a website form or submit a comment on our blog we might ask your name, surname and/or email address so we can contact you with updates, notices, or to provide support..

All these data are being used for contacting you on your specific request or, if you subscribed for our newsletter or commercial communication, for marketing purposes. The legal basis for processing these data is consent of the data subject in receiving that respective information or subscribing to our newsletter.

The duration of processing is until the respecting information and request is being sent, plus a period of 30 days to be sure that there are no more follow-ups needed.

As regards your subscription to our newsletter or commercial communications, we will keep our communication going, until you withdraw your consent or you don’t engage with our email in the past 5 years.

We may also send you follow-up messages if you have completed your data in order to buy our products or services, but you haven’t finalized the entire acquisition process. The legal basis of this data processing is art 6 (1) b of GDPR - taking steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This data is kept for a maximum period of 30 days, unless you complete the acquisition process when data might be kept longer for purposes of performing the contract that you are a part of.

2.2. Traffic data – when a user visits a website, it automatically reveals certain information, such as the IP address, date and time of the visit or the referral website that sent you to Bitdefender websites. Bitdefender, like any other website manager, may record this kind of information for a limited period of time. We also use other external services of traffic analysis, such as Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics.

All these data are used exclusively for website improvement or statistical purposes, but also for improving our web services and ensuring their security. Most of these data is being used only as aggregated data. The data is kept only as long as they are necessary for these purposes.

As a leader in information security services, confidentiality and data protection are of vital importance for us. Access to the collected personal data is restricted only to Bitdefender employees and data processors that need access to this information. All Bitdefender information security policies are ISO 27001 certified.

Bitdefender may use other IT companies to process the collected personal data. These companies are considered data processors and have strict contractual obligations to keep the confidentiality of the processed data and to offer at least the same level of security as Bitdefender. Data processors have the obligation not to allow third parties to process personal data on behalf of Bitdefender and to access, use and/or keep the data secure and confidential.

Bitdefender may host personal data in the European Union or any other jurisdiction which offers adequate level of personal data protection according to European Union standards (art 45 GDPR) or other appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses (art 46.2 GDPR).

Due to confidentiality obligations and security requirements the specific information regarding the name and details for each processor used will be provided only to competent authorities.

1. hosting services in EU and USA;
2. support channel communications in EU and USA;
