Cookie Policy

**COOKIE POLICY**

Last Updated: June 17, 2024

Our websites, online services, mobile applications, and games (together, the "Services") use cookies, pixels, tags, local storage, and other software and tracking tools (collectively, "cookies" unless otherwise noted), which may distinguish you from other users of our Services. We use cookies for a variety of reasons, as further described below, including to operate, protect and improve our Services, track bugs and errors, enable social media and other features, provide you with a good experience when you use our Services, and to personalize ads and content to you, within our Services and across third party sites and services. Some cookies are provided by third parties and enable us and these third parties to distinguish you from other users of our Services and to collect user and activity data related to your use of our Services.

This Cookie Policy provides you with information about the types of cookies we use and the purposes for using those cookies and applies to our Services that link to or display this Cookie Policy.

For a detailed list of the cookies used on this website, please read and review our **Cookie List** found \[[here](#cookielist)\].

[What is a Cookie?](#_EN_01)  
[What Cookies Do We Use and Why?](#_EN_02)  
[How to Change Your Cookie Preferences?](#_EN_03)  
[More Information on Third-Party Ad Networks](#_EN_04)  
[More Information on Third-Party Analytics](#_EN_05)

Please read this Cookie Policy carefully for more information about why we use cookies and your choices regarding cookies.

**What is a Cookie?**

Cookies allow us to operate our Services, optimize how pages and content load, remember users who are logged in, understand how users navigate through and use our Services, display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third-party sites and applications), and make available social network and other third-party features. We may also use cookies for security purposes.

_Browser (http) Cookies._ A browser (or http) cookie is a small file with a unique identifier, that is transferred to your browser by our Services and stores information about your use of our Services. They allow us, for example, to remember users who are logged in, store user preferences, understand how users navigate through and use our Services, and display personalized content and targeted ads. We may use different types of browser or HTTP cookies:

* **_First and Third-Party Cookies._** Whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by Zenimax.com). Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.
* **_Persistent Cookies._** These cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
* **_Session Cookies._** These cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

_Tags/pixels._ Tags are small snippets of code that are embedded within webpages and online content, such as pixel tags (tiny graphics files embedded invisibly on webpages and online content). These can be used to generate and track information about your use of our Services, such as when you visit our websites, view certain content or ads, or take other actions within our Services (or on third-party sites and services). Tags may also be used to set cookies, enable third-party tools (e.g., social media buttons), and personalize content.

**What Cookies Do We Use and Why?**

We use Necessary, Functional, Analytics and Performance, Targeting, and Social Media cookies.

* **_Necessary (Essential)._** These cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly and cannot be switched off in the cookie settings menu for our Services. Without these cookies, the Services will not function properly. For example, we use these cookies to remember information you have entered on forms during a web browser session; to identify you as being logged into our website; for security purposes (such as to detect and prevent bot activity, malicious traffic, and suspicious logins and activity); and to route users to specific applications or specific servers, to optimize page and content loading, and to manage traffic. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but if you block them, certain parts of this website or the Services may not function properly or be available to you. Some necessary cookies may be managed for us by third parties, and we and these third parties may collect IP address, referring URL, and other browser and device-related information through these cookies.
* **_Analytics and Performance._** These cookies generate and collect information about your use of our Services—e.g., which pages you visit, how long you spend logged in or on a page, what content or features you use or search for, and issues you may be experiencing—and they help track unique visits and traffic sources and other aggregate usage information. We use these cookies to measure and improve the performance of our websites and Services. For example, they help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website. Some of our performance cookies are managed for us by third parties..
* **_Functional._** These cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. For example, we use these cookies to remember settings you've applied, such as language, to provide and show embedded videos and content, and to make available certain other features. Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties, including by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then certain features on this website may not be available or function properly.
* **_Targeting._** These are third-party cookies that allow us to better reach you with relevant ads and content---both on our Services and on third-party websites, apps and online services---and to measure and improve our advertising and marketing. These cookies enable third-party companies to track your visits to our websites and the Services, as well as other websites, apps and online services, which they use to understand your interests and activities in order to provide you more relevant ads and content on behalf of us and other companies. If you do not allow these cookies, you will still see ads and targeted content, but they may be less relevant to you.
* **_Social Media._** These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the website to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks, log in to our Services, better reach you with relevant ads and content on these third-party platforms, or otherwise make certain features available to you on our Services. Similar to targeting cookies, they may enable these third-party companies to track your visits to our websites and access to the Services, as well as other websites, apps and online services, in order to understand your browsing activities and interests. Some of these third-party social media companies may make available certain privacy options to you with respect to their services; you should check their respective privacy policies for more information. If you opt out of these cookies, you may not be able to use social features on this website.

**How to Change Your Cookie Preferences?**

You may opt-out of certain cookies or change your cookie preferences for this website as described below.

* **_Our Websites and Online Games._** You can review or change your preferences for most third-party cookies and tags on this website (or other ZeniMax websites) by adjusting your Cookie Settings for the respective websites.

[Cookie Settings](#)

Please note that your preferences are applied on a browser and device basis. So, you will need to set your cookie preferences for each browser and device you use to access this website and the associated Services. Further, if you subsequently delete cookies, your preferences may be lost and need to be reset.

You may also delete, block, or disable one or more cookies via your browser settings; see below for more information on how to do this.

* **_Mobile Games and Apps._** Some of our mobile games and apps may include third-party advertising and analytics. You can review, change, and opt out of targeted advertising from third parties in our mobile games by adjusting your device privacy settings. This means that you will no longer get targeted ads; however, you may still receive contextual or general ads.

In addition, certain of our mobile games include analytics and related personalization that can opt out of through the in-app settings for that game (you can access this setting from the main menu of such mobile games).

**How to Delete and Block Our Cookies through Browser Settings**

You may delete, review, and block cookies by adjusting your browser settings. However, if you block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of our Services.

For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: _<www.allaboutcookies.org>_.

**More Information on Third-Party Ad Networks.**

We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities on our Services and in order to do so we may allow third parties to use cookies to collect usage information on our Services and display targeted ads and content to you on our behalf; these third parties may be able to associate the information they collect on our Services with other information they have about you from other sources. (Please see our **Cookie List** below, for a list of third parties.) This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested and to measure and improve the effectiveness of targeted ads. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. **You may opt-out of Targeting (and other cookies) on our Services as described above.**

For more information about how third-party cookies are used for targeted advertising and how to opt out of certain third-party advertising related cookies, please go to these self-regulatory advertising industry organization websites:

* European Union: [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)

**More Information on Third-Party Analytics**

We use third-party analytics tools, including Google Analytics and others as set forth in our **Cookie List**, to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with [Google](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2), or other third parties, each of which have their own privacy policy addressing how they handle such information and any choices you may have about their collection and use of information. We recommend that you review these privacy policies.

**Google Analytics**

For more information about Google Analytics cookies, please see Google's [help pages](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906) and [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on; if you want to opt out of Google Analytics, you can download and install the add-on for your web browser [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our Services. The information generated by the cookie about your use of one of our Services (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization feature, Google will (a) truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP addresses from the United Kingdom and the European Union/European Economic Area (“EU/UK”), and (b) only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the United States. On behalf of ZeniMax, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on your activity for us and third parties who help operate and provide services related to the Service. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of these cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser as discussed in this Cookie Policy. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Service. Furthermore you can prevent collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

Further information concerning the terms and conditions of use and data privacy can be found at [http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html) or at [https://www.google.de/intl/en\_uk/policies/](https://www.google.de/intl/en_uk/policies/). Please note that on the Services, Google Analytics code is set to enable IP address anonymization prior to the transfer of IP addresses from the EU/UK to the United States.
