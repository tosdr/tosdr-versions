Cookie Policy

Cookie Policy
-------------

Last Updated: December 2022

Our websites, online services, mobile applications and games (together, the "Services") use cookies, in combination with pixels, local storage objects, and similar devices (collectively, "cookies" unless otherwise noted) to distinguish you from other users of our Services. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Services, improve our Services, and to personalize ads and content to you while you use our Services. This Cookie Policy provides you with information about the types of cookies we use and the purposes for using those cookies and applies to our Services that link to or display this Cookie Policy.

For a detailed list of the cookies used on this website, please read and review our **Cookie List** found [here](#cookielist).

[How to Change Your Cookie Preferences?](#change)  
[More Information on Third-Party Ad Networks](#thirdpartynetworks)  
[More Information on Third-Party Analytics](#thirdpartyanalytics)  

Please read this Cookie Policy carefully for more information about why we use cookies and your choices regarding cookies.

**What is a Cookie?**

A (http) cookie is a small file with a unique identifier that is transferred to your browser through our Services. Cookies allow us to operate our Services, remember users who are logged in, to understand how users navigate through and use our Services, to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third-party sites and applications), and for security purposes.

**Types of Cookies**

* _**First and Third-Party Cookies.**_ We use both first-party and third-party cookies on our Services. Whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies placed by Zenimax.com). Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.
    
* _**Persistent Cookies.**_ These cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
    
* _**Session Cookies.**_ These cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
    

**What Cookies Do We Use and Why?**

We use Necessary, Functional, Analytics and Performance, Targeting and Social Media cookies.

* _**Necessary (Essential).**_ These cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly and cannot be switched off in our systems. Without these cookies, we cannot respond to your requests or provide you with the services your request or access on this website. For example, we use these cookies to remember information you have entered on forms during a web browser session; to identify you as being logged into our website; for security purposes; and to route users to specific applications or specific servers. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but if you block them, certain parts of this website or the Services may not function properly or be available to you.
    
* _**Analytics and Performance.**_ These cookies collect information about how you use our Services---e.g., which pages you visit and if you experience any errors. They allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites and Services. For example, they help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website. Some of our performance cookies are managed for us by third parties. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited this website and will not be able to monitor its performance.
    
* _**Functional.**_ These cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. For example, we use these cookies to remember settings you've applied, such as language, to provide and show embedded videos and content, and to make available certain other features. Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties, including by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then certain features on this website may not be available or function properly.
    
* _**Targeting.**_ These are third-party cookies that allow us to better reach you with relevant ads and content---both on our Services and on third-party websites, apps and online services---and to measure and improve our advertising and marketing. These cookies enable third-party companies to track your visits to our websites and the Services, as well as other websites, apps and online services, which they use to understand your interests and activities in order to provide you more relevant ads and content on behalf of us and other companies. If you do not allow these cookies, you will still see ads and targeted content, but they may be less relevant to you.
    
* _**Social Media.**_ These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the website to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks, log in to our Services, better reach you with relevant ads and content on these third-party platforms, or otherwise make certain features available to you on our Services. Similar to targeting cookies, they may enable these third-party companies to track your visits to our websites and access to the Services, as well as other websites, apps and online services, in order to understand your browsing activities and interests. Some of these third-party social media companies may make available certain privacy options to you with respect to their services; you should check their respective privacy policies for more information. If you opt out of these cookies, you may not be able to use social features on this website.

**More Information on Third-Party Ad Networks.**

We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities on our Services and in order to do so we may allow third parties to use cookies to collect usage information on our Services and display targeted ads and content to you on our behalf; these third parties may be able to associate the information they collect on our with other information they have about you from other sources. (Please see our **Cookie List below**, for a list of third parties.) This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested and to measure and improve the effectiveness of targeted ads. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. **You may opt-out of Targeting (and other cookies) on our Services as described above.**

**More Information on Third-Party Analytics**

We use third-party analytics tools, including Google Analytics and others as set forth in our **Cookie List**, to collect, monitor and analyze this information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with [Google](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2), or other third parties, each of which have their own privacy policy addressing how they handle such information and any choices you may have about their collection and use of information. We recommend that you review these privacy policies.

**Google Analytics**

For more information about Google Analytics cookies, please see Google's [help pages](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906) and [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on; if you want to opt out of Google Analytics, you can download and install the add-on for your web browser [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our Services. The information generated by the cookie about your use of one of our Services (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization feature, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the United States. On behalf of our Service, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on your activity for us and third parties who help operate and provide services related to the Service. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of these cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser as discussed in this Cookie Policy. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Service. Furthermore you can prevent collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).
