    When you receive a Credit, Listia hereby grants you a limited license ("Credit License") to use the Credit as a virtual token to be held, bartered, traded and/or transferred on the Service with other users (and/or Listia), in exchange for permission to access and use content, applications, services, and various user-listed items, in accordance with these Terms of Service. The Credit License is transferable by the holder to any other user, provided that both users comply with these Terms of Service and maintain their Accounts in good standing. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or otherwise expressly permitted by Listia, the Credit License may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition by operation of law or otherwise, and you agree that any attempted disposition in violation of these Terms of Service is null and void. Listia may revoke the Credit License at any time without notice, refund or compensation in the event that: (i) the Credit program is suspended or terminated; (ii) Listia determines that the Account holder has committed fraud or other illegal conduct; (iii) Listia imposes an expiration date on usage of Credits in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) the holder's Account is terminated for violation of these Terms of Service; or (v) the holder ceases to maintain an active Account or terminates this Agreement.  
      
    You acknowledge that Credits are not real or virtual currency or any type of financial instrument and are not redeemable for any sum of money from Listia at any time. You agree that Listia has the right to manage, regulate, control, and/or modify the license rights underlying such Credits as it sees fit and that Listia will have no liability to you based on its exercise of this right. Listia makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of the features of the Service that will be accessible through the use of Credits, or the availability or supply of Credits. Listia may modify, revalue, or make the Credits and Services more or less common, valuable, effective, or functional.

When another user wins your listing, you get the winning bid amount in Credits added to your Account, less any stated transaction fees. Credits may also be purchased for a fee from Listia. Credits may be held by Listia in a pending state or in escrow while both parties confirm that the items in the listing have been delivered and received.  
      
    You acknowledge that except as set forth in this Agreement, purchases of Credits or other goods, content and features of the Service are final, non-refundable, have no monetary value (i.e. are not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to use, even if they come with a durational term (e.g. a monthly subscription). Notwithstanding any agreement by Listia to provide a discretionary pro-rata refund or credit in certain circumstances, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, economic, or monetary interest in your Account, Credits, content or subscriptions, which remain the exclusive property of Listia.
