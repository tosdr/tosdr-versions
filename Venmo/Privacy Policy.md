Privacy Statement
-----------------

**DATE EFFECTIVE**

May 12, 2024

Please [click here](#teen-users) to learn how we manage information about Teen Users.

**OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY**

Venmo, a PayPal, Inc. service, knows that you care about how your personal information is used and disclosed, and we take your privacy seriously. Our primary goal is to provide you with exceptional service, and we understand that you may have questions or concerns regarding your personal information and how it will be used. To make this Privacy Statement easy to find, we make it available from the home page of the Venmo website at [**venmo.com**](https://venmo.com/) (the "website") and through our mobile applications. You may also email us at [**privacy@venmo.com**](mailto:%20privacy@venmo.com) with any privacy-related questions you have.

**APPLICABILITY OF PRIVACY STATEMENT**

This Privacy Statement applies to all information we collect through our Services from current and former Venmo users. “Services” means any products, services, content, features, technologies, or functions, and all related websites, applications and services offered to you by PayPal, Inc. in connection with a Venmo account. When you are no longer our customer, we continue to disclose your information as described in this Statement. This Statement only applies to the Services and does not apply to the practices of any other PayPal service.

Venmo is always improving. As the Services evolve we may occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes to our business, Services, or applicable laws. If the revised version requires notice in accordance with applicable law, we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "**Privacy Statement**" page of our website and mobile apps, otherwise the revised Privacy Statement will be effective as of the published effective date. If you are a new customer or are receiving this Privacy Statement for the first time and there is an upcoming change described on the “Privacy Statement” page of our website and mobile app at the time you receive this Privacy Statement, such upcoming change will apply to you on the indicated effective date.

Throughout this Privacy Statement, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been aggregated and/or anonymized so that it does not identify a specific person.

This Privacy Statement also applies to all information we collect from non-Venmo users who receive a payment from Venmo users through the Visa+ Service (the “Recipient”).

The Visa+ Service enables customers, with an eligible Venmo account, to send and receive money to and from PayPal and third-party Visa+-enabled digital wallets (“Visa+”).

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications or other Services, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect Geolocation Information (defined below). If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.

If you open a Venmo account, we collect the following information from you:

* Account Information - text-enabled cellular/wireless telephone number, machine or mobile device ID and other similar information.
    
* Identification Information - your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and Social Security number ("SSN") (or other governmental issued verification numbers).
    
* Device Information - information about you: (a) from your mobile device or computer such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, Geolocation Information, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes. For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards.
    
* Geolocation Information - information that identifies with reasonable specificity your location by using, for instance, longitude and latitude coordinates obtained through GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell site triangulation. We will collect this data for fraud and risk purposes. In addition, some of our Services may ask you for permission to disclose your current location within your device settings to enhance our Services. If you do not agree to our collection of Geolocation Information, our Services may not function properly when you try to use them. For information about your ability to restrict the collection and use of Geolocation Information to enhance our Services, please refer to the settings available in your device.
    
* Social Web Information - with your consent, we may also collect information from social networks, such as your Facebook Connect credentials and email account information. If you authorize Facebook Connect, the plug in allows us access to your email address, Facebook friends list, and public profile (including profile picture). We also allow you to import data from other social web services, including but not limited to Twitter, FourSquare, and email service providers. Social and e-mail contact information helps you connect to friends and contacts for invitation and payment transmission purposes (as well as helping us improve the Services and fight fraud). Additionally, another Venmo user may mention you in a transaction to which you are not a party by “tagging” your username in a transaction note or comment. When you are mentioned in a transaction note or comment into which you have visibility (e.g., a public transaction, a “friends only” transaction by one of your Venmo friends, or a comment on either such transaction), a link to your Venmo profile will appear in the transaction note or comment and, if your push notifications are turned on, you will receive a push notification about the mentions. You may manage certain contact preferences and notifications in your account settings.
    
* Financial Information - bank account online login information, bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Venmo account. Venmo does not disclose financial information with third party social networking services such as those listed in the prior bullet.
    
* Biometric Information - when you consent in the user experience, we collect face scans to authenticate your account and manage fraud and risk.
    
* Audio, electronic, visual or similar information - Call recordings when you talk to customer service or sales.
    
* Professional or employment information – including business information, contact emails, phone numbers and taxpayer ID numbers.
    
* Information you provide when you contact us – your response to surveys, recorded conversations, chat conversations with us, email correspondence with us, account status, repayment history, information about others if you choose to share it with us.
    

We may also collect the above data from other third parties, including service providers, internet service providers, partners and merchants, credit reporting agencies, government entities, data brokers, data analytics providers, advertising networks, card networks and financial institutions.

In particular, for Visa+ we will receive the Recipient’s name and payment information from Visa and third-party Visa+ participating digital wallets for the purpose of processing and matching Visa+ payment transactions between participating digital wallets and Venmo.

We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all-around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use the Services, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information in order to comply with law or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.

When you are using the Services, we collect information about your account transactions and we may collect Geolocation Information and/or information about your computer or your operating systems or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.

Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team, store results when you respond to a survey, or when you use PayPal or another PayPal service.

**INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**

The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such data. [Contact us](https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from a child under the age of 13.

**INFORMATION FOR AND ABOUT TEEN USERS**

In this section we explain how we handle your data if you use a Venmo Teen Account. We may offer an account holder (“Account Holder”) the opportunity to create a Venmo Teen Account for use by an authorized individual between the ages of 13 and 17 years old at account creation (“Teen User”). We will not collect more information about you than what is required to use the Teen Account.

**What data do we collect?**

**Identifiers**: An Account Holder provides your name, birthday, address, and phone number. You will create a username/password for online account access. You will also provide your email address when you sign up for access to the app. When you use your Teen Account, you can make changes to your name that is displayed to other users.  
  
**Device Information**: Information about your mobile device or computer such as your device type and IP address.  
  
**Internet or network activity**: Interactions with our Services, Information about response time for web pages, download errors, date and time when you used the Teen Account, statistics regarding how pages are loaded or viewed, and other usage information.

**Why do we collect your data?**  
  
To provide our Services: We only collect data from Teen Users that is necessary to interact with the Teen Account, such as to enable you to send or receive money or use Venmo as payment method at checkout at an authorized merchant's website or mobile app or in-person by using a Venmo QR code.

**HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE VENMO NETWORK**

To process payments on Venmo, we need to disclose some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received and other verification metrics like social graph activity may be provided to users or companies when you transact with, on, or through Venmo.

We work with vendors to enable them to accept payments from you using Venmo. In doing so, a vendor may disclose information about you with us, such as your mobile phone number or Venmo username, when you attempt to pay that vendor. We use this information to confirm to that vendor that you are a Venmo customer and that the vendor should enable Venmo as a form of payment for your purchase.

Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through Venmo, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so in order to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.

**HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES**

Venmo does not disclose your personal information with third parties for their promotional or marketing purposes.

Some personal information is public information and may be seen by anyone on the internet, whether or not they have a Venmo account. Public information may also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through Venmo's APIs or third-party services that integrate with our products.

* Public information for personal profiles includes your Venmo username, profile photo, first and last name, month and year of Venmo account creation, and public transactions in which you've been involved.
    
* Public information for business or charity profiles includes Venmo username, profile and background photos, business or charity name, business or charity description, and QR code.
    
* Public information for business or charity profiles may be indexed by and searchable on search engines.
    

In addition to any public information, your Venmo friends list may be seen by any logged-in Venmo user; you may adjust or turn off this setting in the privacy section in your account settings.

We may disclose your personal information with:

* Our parent company, PayPal, Inc. and affiliates and subsidiaries it controls, but only for purposes allowed by this document.
    
* Companies that PayPal, Inc. plans to merge with or be acquired by or, in the event of any bankruptcy, a bankruptcy estate. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Statement with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this Statement, you will receive prior notice and the opportunity to communicate preferences you may have, if applicable.
    
* Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if PayPal is compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; when it is necessary to do so to comply with law; or where the disclosure of personal information is reasonably necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of the Venmo User Agreement, or as otherwise required by law.
    
* Third party service providers who assist us in providing Services to you or who provide fraud detection or similar services on our or any vendor’s behalf.
    
* The other Venmo user participating in the transaction and, depending on the privacy setting of each Venmo account transaction, your Venmo friends and the Venmo friends of the other user participating in the transaction, or the public, through the Venmo feed on our website and mobile application and elsewhere on the internet. For transactions and activity made with other Venmo users using a groups feature, the other Venmo users in that group will be able to see your transactions and activity.
    
* Businesses when you follow their business profile. We will share your name with a business when you follow their profile.
    
* Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations (for example, fraud prevention, payment processing, or technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
    
* Partners and merchants, their service providers and others involved in a transaction, for example when you use the Services to initiate online purchases, pay non-Venmo users through Visa+ or return goods, we may disclose information about you and your Venmo account with the other parties (or their service providers) involved in processing your transactions. We may also disclose Personal Information to partners and merchants to enable their use of our Services to facilitate your transactions. For example, when you visit a participating merchant site or app, the merchant can check whether you are a user of PayPal services and present a recommended payment method to you to simplify your checkout process. Please note that personal information shared with partners and merchants (or their service providers) involved in a transaction is subject to the partners’ and merchants’ own privacy policy and procedures.  
    
* For our businesses and their beneficial owners, we report personal information to databases maintained by the card networks pursuant to the card scheme rules to fulfill listing and reporting obligations.
    
* Other users if you have a business profile. You may choose to display certain information about your business profile on the Venmo network, such as your street address, phone number, email, social media accounts and website. You can control how this information is displayed in your business profile settings. We will also disclose certain information about your business profile to other users, such as how long ago your business profile was created, total number of subscribers, and total number of transactions. We may also use your address, transaction activity and engagement activity on Venmo to rank your business relative to other businesses in your area.
    
* Other third parties with your consent or at your direction to do so, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform.
    
    * For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an "account connection" with such a third party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Venmo account and a non-Venmo account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you authorize such a connection, Venmo and the third-party will exchange your personal information and other information directly. Examples of account connections include, without limitation: linking your Venmo account to a social media account or social messaging service; connecting your Venmo account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Venmo account log-in credentials; or using your Venmo account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Venmo account.
        
    * If you connect your Venmo account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and account and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service. For example, if you connect your Venmo account to a social media account, we will receive personal information from the social media provider via the account connection. We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.
        
    * Information that we disclose with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices. Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your personal information as part of the account connection. For example, personal information that Venmo discloses with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be disclosed with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.
        
    * If you choose to use Siri or iMessage to send payments via Venmo or to otherwise use the Services, such use is subject to Apple’s terms and conditions for use of iMessage and/or Siri, as applicable, and the terms of the Venmo User Agreement. By using Siri or iMessage, you authorize us to disclose some of your Venmo account data (including your friends list, list of persons you have transacted with most recently and most frequently, transaction instructions, and transaction notes) with Apple to allow it to facilitate transaction requests made through Siri or iMessage on iOS. Data disclosed with Apple will be used pursuant to Apple’s then-current user agreements and privacy policies. You can grant or revoke Apple’s access to Venmo on iOS at any time under the “Siri” or “iMessage” settings on your iPhone.
        

Venmo does not send your personal information to third-party social networks unless you have specifically requested or authorized us to do so. When you broadcast information to such third-party social networks, such information is no longer under the control of Venmo and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third parties.

**HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**
