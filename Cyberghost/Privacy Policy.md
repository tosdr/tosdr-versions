We **do NOT have** any access to the credit card information you submitted to our payment processor and **we DO NOT connect** your payment or information with any kind of online activity done by you inside the CyberGhost VPN tunnel.

**We provide a service that protects privacy**. We take your data very seriously and we put a lot of effort to ensure safe storage and protection of your data. We believe you should always know what data we collect and how we use it. This document (**Privacy Policy**) defines and informs you of any and all of the instances in which your data and information is collected and used.

In order to maintain a high-quality degree for our service and also an excellent customer support experience, CyberGhost is using certain 3rd parties to collect and process the following aggregate data:

### How do we collect non-personal data?

We automatically collect anonymous Non-personal Information through different technologies as described below.

#### A. Website:

Our website may use 3rd parties analytic tools, including without limitation, Google Analytics, Mouseflow and AppsFlyer. We use such tools to better understand how you use the Website and ways that we can improve your experience. Through these tools, we can see trends of usage of our Website such as total number of unique users, clicks, popular webpages or articles by number of total impressions, time spent on the website etc. This data is anonymous and never linked to your account or Personal Data. These third parties use pixels or cookies to measure things such as the average time spent by users on the Site or visited pages so we learn how to improve the Site for you. Please see more information about this in our Cookie Policy [https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en\_US/cookiepolicy](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/cookiepolicy) .

**Appsflyer**: Third party analytics, like Appsflyer, are also used to track and measure usage of the Site so that we can continue to provide engaging content. These cookies may track your use of the Website, including without limitation, how long you spent on the Website or specific pages you visited, which helps us to understand how we can improve the Website. Appsflyer: [https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/services-privacy-policy](https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/services-privacy-policy)

This website uses Mouseflow: a website analytics tool that provides a review of individual experiences or zoom out to identify patterns, while capturing real feedback to uncover optimization opportunities. Mouseflow does not collect any information on pages where it is not installed, nor does it track or collect information outside your web browser

* For more information, see Mouseflow’s Privacy Policy at [https://mouseflow.com/privacy](https://mouseflow.com/privacy) .
* For more information on Mouseflow and GDPR, visit [https://mouseflow.com/gdpr](https://mouseflow.com/gdpr) .
* For more information on Mouseflow and CCPA, visit [https://mouseflow.com/ccpa](https://mouseflow.com/ccpa) .

Mouseflow does not set any cookies.

Lastly, as stipulated above to provide you with online chat support, we use Zendesk. Zendesk collects both personal as well as anonymous information. It collects anonymous information by placing cookies in your browser.

Please refer to our Cookie Policy for additional information.

#### B. Service:

The performance of the Service is measured through a series of events sent anonymously to third-party services which is building aggregate data based on certain trends. Few examples of events are indicatively mentioned below:

Connection Attempt: We collect this information to know the usage request directed to our Service on a particular hourly/daily/weekly/monthly interval, the country of origin (but not your source IP address), your CyberGhost VPN version, etc. This metric allows us to properly adjust our infrastructure according to the demand.

Connection Successful: We collect this information to know how many users per hourly/daily/weekly/monthly intervals successfully established VPN connections to our service. This information correlated with the above event results, is helping our engineers to determine if there are any network issues which might prevent users from starting the service, identify peak hour intervals for our service so we can have the infrastructure scaled to meet the requests, etc.

### Ordering Our Service

To order our Service you must choose which option works best for you on our pricing [page](https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/buy), once you click on "order now" you will be asked to register to create a secure account by inserting your email address. Thereafter you will be asked to choose your method of payment between credit card, paypal and bitcoin. The specific information collected varies depending on the payment method you choose. To minimize the amount of Personal Data you submit to us, we recommend that you use bitcoin payments when subscribing to our Service.

Although this page may have the look and feel of the Website please make sure that you are aware that you are now on our third party payment processor's site in order to complete your transaction. The name, address, card number, expiration date, and email address will be collected by the applicable, third party payment processor to process your request. Your name and email address will be shared back with us in order for us to provide you with your subscription to CyberGhost VPN.

We do not have any access to the credit card information you submitted to our payment processor. We do not connect your personal information with any kind of online activity done by you inside the CyberGhost VPN tunnel, such as: browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses or DNS queries. The payment processors privacy policy governs the collection and use of the information collected during the check-out process which we recommend you review prior to placing an order or providing any information.

### Security of Your Personal Data

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. In March 2012, CyberGhost had successfully passed an audit and verification conducted by QSCert for the implemented Information Safety Management System (ISMS) according to the international industrial standards ISO27001 and ISO9001. The certification confirms the high quality of the internal safety processes and is renewed yearly ever since. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with the Website is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please contact us immediately.

During the development of the Service and the selection of its service providers, CyberGhost has paid attention to providing a high degree of safety:

All data processing centers with which CyberGhost cooperates pass through a compliance process. CyberGhost has generally Root Access to all its servers and administers them itself.

If you feel that your privacy was treated not in accordance with our Policy, or if any person attempted to abuse our Service or acted in an inappropriate manner, please contact us directly at [support@cyberghost.ro](mailto:support@cyberghost.ro). Further, in the event of a data breach, in which we discover your Peronal Data is at risk, we will notify you immediately through your account or the Website or, if technically possible, by sending you an email.

### Your rights and Control:

Your principal rights under data protection law in relation to your Personal Data are:

* (a) the right to access and information which is provided to you through your account;
* (b) the right to rectification;
* (c) the right to erasure;
* (d) the right to restrict processing;
* (e) the right to object to processing;
* (f) the right to data portability;
* (g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
* (h) the right to withdraw consent.

### Service Performance Data and CyberGhost VPN Connection Summary Statistics

Through our strict no-logs-policy, we ensure that we do NOT track user traffic performed inside the CyberGhost VPN tunnel such as: browsing history, traffic destination, search preferences, data content, IP addresses or DNS queries. Therefore:

* We do NOT know at any time which user ever accessed a particular website or service
* We do NOT know which user was connected to our CyberGhost VPN service at any given time or which CyberGhost VPN server IP they used
* We do NOT know the set of original IP addresses from a user’s computer

CyberGhost is 100% committed to the no-logs-policy and we do not store them. Logs can easily link actions back to you, and thus at no time can CyberGhost release such logs, as we don’t collect any logs.

If you are under 18, please be sure to read the Agreement with your parents or legal guardians.

If you become aware or have any reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has shared any information with us, please contact us at: [support@cyberghost.ro](mailto:support@cyberghost.ro) and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.
