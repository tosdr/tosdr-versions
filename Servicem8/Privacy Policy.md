Privacy Policy  

=================

### 1\. Overview

ServiceM8 is field service management software for trade contractors and home services businesses. It’s cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS). Field staff use the software via a native app for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, and office staff can access the ServiceM8 dashboard via web browser on their Mac or PC.  
  

ServiceM8 is committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information.  
  
The primary purpose of this policy is to communicate to you how ServiceM8 deals with your personal information. It explains how we collect, use and disclose your personal information, as well as other information or data associated with you and your use of our services. It also informs you about rights and responsibilities you have regarding your personal information, in association with your use of our services.  
  

We believe in informed consent at ServiceM8. We therefore encourage you to read this policy carefully, to help you make an informed decision about sharing your information with us.  
  

By accessing or using our website or software, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy as well as our [Terms of Service](https://www.servicem8.com/terms-of-service).

### 5\. Security

ServiceM8 takes reasonable physical, technical and administrative precautions to protect Your information from loss, theft, or unauthorised access, alteration or disclosure.  
  

ServiceM8's servers are secured by SSL Certificates issued by Amazon, so all data transferred between You and ServiceM8 is encrypted, including data transferred to iPhone and iPad devices.  
  

ServiceM8 is built from the ground up using Amazon's Cloud Computing technology. Your account data is backed up every 24 hours to Amazon's S3 infrastructure in multiple locations around the world. Data is redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple facilities in an Amazon S3 Region (note this multi-region service is not available if You are located within the European Economic Area).

‍

#### Notification of breach

Should ServiceM8 become aware of any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, or breach of personal information, if such a breach represents a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, ServiceM8 will notify You of the breach as soon as possible.

#### Username & password security

It is your responsibility to protect the security of your ServiceM8 username and password. ServiceM8 staff, and independent ServiceM8 Partners, do not have access to your password and will never ask for your password. Your ServiceM8 password should be unique.

‍

### 6\. Advertising & Choice

ServiceM8 will not sell or otherwise disclose Your information to marketers or promotional third parties without your consent.  
  

ServiceM8 may use your information for the purpose of sending you training, marketing or promotional communications, related to the Service, or which we determine may be of interest to you due to being relevant to Your business or industry.  
  

You may opt out of these communications via ‘unsubscribe’ mechanisms. However, note that we may still send You communications important to Your use and our provision and administration of the Service to You.

You may access a backup of all data within Your ServiceM8 account once every 24 hours (in your Online Dashboard, go to Settings > Backup).

  
You may close Your ServiceM8 account at any time.

However, note that ServiceM8 may have a variety of obligations to retain some or all of Your personal and other information for certain periods.

‍

### 8\. Use of Services by Minors

You may not use the Service if you are under 16 years of age, unless ServiceM8 is provided with the appropriate parental or legal guardian consent.

### 9\. International Transfers

Our services are global and account data (including Your personal and other information) may be stored and processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers, and we may transfer Your information to countries outside of Your country of residence, which may have data protection rules that are different to those of Your country. In these cases we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers, and Your information and account data, remain protected.

‍

If You are located within the European Economic Area (EEA), your account data will be housed in data centres within the EEA. Note that certain personal information and account data may still be transferred outside of the EEA for the purpose of provision of the Service to You. In these cases, ServiceM8 has taken measures to ensure such transfers are provided an adequate level of protection and remain in accordance with applicable data protection law. You can read about ServiceM8 & the EU's _General Data Protection Regulation_ [here](https://www.servicem8.com/gdpr).

Through provision of the Service to You, ServiceM8 has an obligation to process Your personal and other information, and account data, as directed by You as part of Your use of the Service, and in accordance with this policy and our Terms of Service. Under this policy and as a data controller, ServiceM8 has certain obligations to ensure the privacy of Your personal and other information.

  
In turn, Your use of the Service involves You collecting, holding and using certain personal and other information about Your customers and any other personal data. You determine and control the entry, use and retention of any personal information within your account. You should be aware of Your responsibilities as a data controller when collecting, holding and using personal information about Your customers, and the corresponding rights of Your customers or data subjects.

‍

If You collect, hold and use a third party's personal information as part of Your use of the Service then You warrant to us that You have the third party’s consent to do so.
