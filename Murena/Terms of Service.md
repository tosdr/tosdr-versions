#### Product and Services

**New and Refurbished Smartphones with /e/OS**

Upon placing Your Order with Us and according to Your instructions, We source new or used mobile smartphones on which We install /e/OS operating system and its default apps.

These phones come with their battery and compatible accessories if applicable (hands-free kit and, if specified, other compatible accessories).

/e/OS is a version of Android that does not use Google’s Android services. The OS operating system is constantly improving, and it may have different features from a Google Android system, different choice of Android application than what can be found on the Google Play store. /e/OS is not a Google Product, and it is not supported by Google under any circumstances.

Refurbished smartphones with /e/OS are not delivered in their original packaging. The Product We sell must undergo tests and treatments that vary according to their type in order to provide You with a near “new” condition. The list of said tests and treatments performed by type of Product is available upon request.

All refurbished smartphones we sell have undergone a data “hard reset” before being put on sale.
