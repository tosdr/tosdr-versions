Dear Obscure Gamers users, We would like to inform you that the Obscure Gamers forum will be shutting down and continuing as a read-only archive. These changes are effective within 24 hours of this announcement going live. If you have any data on the forum you want to back up, this is your only opportunity to do so. Currently the forum is operating at a loss, and it simply is not sustainable to keep things open under the current circumstances surrounding donations and usage. We are...

Since our dealings with the Xperia Play 2 prototype, we've been contacted to save more unreleased games, prototype game consoles/dev kits and some really obscure/rare nintendo hardware that's not been document fully. Unlike the last lot, this one is split into batches and will be paid as each goal is reached in order from the top. We've got a PlayStation 3 devkit up for grabs, this contains 3 unreleased video games, and another 6/7 game alphas. Including games dated over a year before...

A week ago we launched a fundraiser for an unreleased PlayStation console, Today we're proud to announce we have saved one of two unreleased Xperia Play 2 phones, also codenamed the &quot;PSP Phone&quot; until PlayStation didn't give it's full blessings so it became the Xperia Play (also known as the Zeus in development). Things didn't go all the plan, the reshipper in Hong Kong told us DHL wouldn't insure it if below 5KG which seemed stupid, so we paid another £55 postage on top of the £170 we...

As much as I've always been against ads, and with donations lowish compared to the past, we've decided to add adverts to OG. This is part of our plan to keep OG alive for the future, while nobody likes them we've made it so donators don't see them as a perk of this and for their support. More changes are coming, and we'll post soon about these.
