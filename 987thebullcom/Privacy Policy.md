**A. Consumer Rights Under California Law**

**_Right to Know._**  California residents have the right to request that Alpha disclose what information we have collected, used, disclosed, or sold about you. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request for such information, we may disclose to you, based on your specific request:  
–  The categories of personal information we collected about you;  
–  The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;  
–  The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;  
–  The categories of third-parties with whom we shared your personal information;  
–  If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipients obtained;  
–  If we sold your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipients purchased; or  
–  Specific pieces of data

**_Right to Request Deletion_**. California residents have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. 

**_Right to Correct_**_._ California residents have the right to ask that we correct inaccurate information that we have about you.

**_Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information._** In certain circumstances, California residents have the right to ask that we limit the collection and use of sensitive personal information.

**_Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal Information._**  California residents have the right to direct businesses that sell personal information to not sell your personal information (the “right to opt-out”).

We use digital technologies, including online identifiers, to provide you with personalized marketing and perform online analytics.  We may disclose these online identifiers to our analytics and marketing partners. The CCPA considers this to be Selling and Sharing of your personal information. Alpha does not have actual knowledge that it Sells or Shares Personal Information about consumers under 16 years of age.   

Additionally, we may share your information with co-sponsors of our contests and promotions, which also could be considered a Sale under the CCPA.

You have the right to opt-out of Selling and Sharing. For more information about these activities and to exercise your right to opt-out of Selling and Sharing, please see our [“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”](https://www.987thebull.com/notice-of-right-to-opt-out) page, which contains our Notice of the Right to Opt-Out and opt-out mechanism.     

**_Right to Opt-In to Sales of Personal Information for Minors Under 16._** We do not sell the personal information of California residents we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13-15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

**_Right to Non-Discrimination_**. California residents have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised the rights established by the CCPA. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

We may, however, offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. For more information about the CCPA-permitted financial incentives that we offer, see [Notice of Financial Incentive.](#caincentive)

**_California Shine the Light Rights._** Under California’s Shine the Light law, California residents may request certain details about how their information is shared with third-parties for direct marketing purposes.

**B. How California Residents Can Exercise Their Rights**

You or your authorized agent may submit a verifiable consumer request using the contact information listed below.

The verifiable consumer request must do the following:  
–  Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.  
–  Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

To exercise any of the rights listed above, please:  
Call us at 866-593-4937;  
Fill out this [form](https://www.alphamediausa.com/ccpa-opt-out/); or  
Email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.987thebull.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

**C. How We Verify California Residents’ Requests to Know/Requests for Access and Requests for Deletion**

We will not respond to certain consumer requests unless we can verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. To verify your identity, when feasible, we will use information about you that we already have; however, we may need to request additional information, which we will use only for the purposes of verification. We may also use a third-party identity verification service.

The information we need to verify your request will depend on the nature and scope of your request. Upon receipt of your request, we will notify you if we need additional information from you to verify your request.

**D. Notice of Financial Incentive**

This Notice of Financial Incentive is part of Alpha’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.alphamediausa.com/privacy-policy/) and includes an explanation of financial incentives we offer California residents. This Notice of Financial Incentive applies solely to California residents (“California consumers” or “you”). We adopt this Notice of Financial Incentive in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Notice of Financial Incentive.

**_Summary of Financial Incentive Offered._** Alpha conducts contests and promotions. Listeners who share certain personal information with us—for example, their name and contact information, such as an email address or social media account details—have a chance of to win the contest or promotion. Alpha also offers listeners the opportunity to sign up to receive early access information for certain shows, or participate in similar promotions, by providing personal information such as their name and an email address. Each individual contest, promotion, or early ticket offer is governed by its own terms, and the exact financial incentive offered will be detailed there. Alpha values the data of listeners that participate in our incentives because it allows us to engage with and reward our loyal listeners with promotions and other incentives tailored to their interests and level of engagement with us.  The value of each consumer’s data depends on the listener’s level of engagement with us and our sponsors compared to the level of engagement of listeners that do not participate in our incentives.

**_Opt-in to Financial Incentive Program._** For participation in incentive programs related to our contests and promotions, you must provide your opt-in consent. To opt-in to Alpha’s financial incentive for an individual contest or promotion, go to [alphamediausa.com](https://www.alphamediausa.com/).

### **Section 4: Additional Information for Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia Residents**

This section of the Privacy Policy only applies to residents of Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. If you are not a resident of one of these states, this section does not apply to you.

**Targeted Advertising:**  We use digital technologies, including online identifiers, to provide you with personalized advertisements. We may disclose these online identifiers to our advertising partners. Under relevant laws, this is considered to be a Targeted Advertising and you have the right to opt-out of this processing [here](https://www.987thebull.com/notice-of-right-to-opt-out).

Additionally, we may share your information with co-sponsors of our contests and promotions, which also could be considered a Sale under relevant laws. To opt-out of this sharing of your information or to exercise your other rights, please contact us using one of the methods listed below.
