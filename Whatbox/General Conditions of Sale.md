Refund Policy
-------------

You can request a refund by creating a new [support ticket](https://whatbox.ca/support/create?subject=Refund) and speaking with one of our staff.

### Availability

Refunds are available for seven days after purchase or renewal.

### Pro-rated

Your refund will be [pro-rated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_rata) based on the remaining time and upload traffic.

### Talk to us

Please let us know why you would like a refund. If you are having problems with our service, we will try and help.

### Refund method

We can only refund transactions using the method of original payment.

### Future service

We may refuse future services to customers who repeatedly purchase new services and then request refunds.

### Cryptocurrencies

We are regrettably unable to offer refunds for cryptocurrency transactions:

* High volatility makes refunds unpleasant. A refund of equal fiat value may return significantly less cryptocurrency.
* Transaction fees can go much higher than fiat payment methods, making refunds abnormally costly.
* We don't hold cryptocurrency and don't wish to purchase it specifically for refunds.
* Anonymity makes it challenging to prove we refund the same person who made the initial purchase.
