### Reporting abuse

If you believe one of our customers is distributing your content without appropriate rights or license, you may contact our abuse department via email.

[abuse@whatbox.ca](mailto:abuse@whatbox.ca)

### Automated enforcement

Our abuse email supports the ACNS Email Delivery specification. By sending ACNS emails, we will scan the reported server, notify the appropriate customer and enforce removal.

As with all automation, our response is only as good as your input. For good results, please ensure that the ACNS XML payload is accurate and well-formed.

* The payload must be valid XML
* The payload must validate against the ACNS XML Schema Definition
* The contents of the payload must be accurate and complete
* Malformed payloads may cause reply delays or even failure

By sending an email to [abuse@whatbox.ca](mailto:abuse@whatbox.ca) containing ACNS XML:

* You understand that malformed payloads may cause processing delays or silent failure
* You release us from liability for such failures if they occur

### Human responses

If you wish to speak with someone from our abuse department, please ensure there is no ACNS XML in your email. Please be aware that human responses from our abuse department may not be immediate due to: evenings, weekends, holidays, and staff availability. Typically you should expect a few business days to hear back from us.
