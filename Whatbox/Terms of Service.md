Terms of Service
----------------

These Whatbox Terms of Service (together, the "Agreement") are entered into by Whatbox Inc. ("Whatbox") and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ("Customer") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services.

This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept it (the "Effective Date"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.

### 1\. Provision of the Services.

1.1 _Services Use._ During the term, Whatbox will provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLAs, and Customer may use the Services, and integrate the Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with the Agreement.

1.2 _Accounts._ Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account. Whatbox has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.

1.3 _Modifications._

(a) _To the Services._ Whatbox may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. Whatbox will inform Customer if Whatbox makes a material change to the Services that has a material impact on Customer's use of the Services provided that Customer has subscribed with Whatbox to be informed about such change.

(b) _To the Agreement_ Whatbox may make changes to this Agreement (including the URL Terms) and pricing from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by Whatbox, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except where required by applicable law, in which case they will be effective immediately. Whatbox will provide at least 30 days' advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by (i) sending an email to the Notification Email Address or (ii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer may stop using the Services. Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under [Section 8.3 (Termination for Convenience)](#8.3). Customer's continued use of the Services after such material change will constitute Customer's consent to such changes. Whatbox will post any modification to this Agreement to [https://whatbox.ca/policies/terms](https://whatbox.ca/policies/terms).

(c) _Discontinuation of Services_ Whatbox will notify Customer at least 3 months before discontinuing any Service (or associated material functionality) unless Whatbox replaces such discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service or functionality. Nothing in this [Section 1.3(c) (Discontinuation of Services)](#1.3(c)) limits Whatbox's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This [Section 1.3(c) (Discontinuation of Services)](#1.3(c)) does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality.

### 2\. Payment Terms.

2.1 _Prepaid Billing._ Unless otherwise specified by Whatbox, Whatbox shall offer the Services on a prepaid basis only. Accordingly, Whatbox shall bill and collect payment for the Services in advance.

2.2 _Taxes._

(a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Whatbox for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Whatbox is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to Whatbox, unless Customer provides Whatbox with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.

(b) Customer will provide Whatbox with any applicable tax identification information that Whatbox may require under applicable law to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Whatbox for) any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.

2.3 _Payment Disputes & Refunds._ Any payment disputes must be submitted before the payment due date. If the parties determine that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Whatbox, Whatbox will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Whatbox will apply the credit memo amount to a disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. Refunds (if any) are at Whatbox's discretion and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Whatbox to extend credit to any party. Refer to the Refund Policy for more details.

2.4 _Delinquent Payments; Suspension._ Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Whatbox in collecting such delinquent amounts. Further, if Customer's payment for the Services is overdue, Whatbox may Suspend the Services.

2.5 _No Purchase Order Number Required._ Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Whatbox to provide a purchase order number on Whatbox's invoice (or otherwise).

### 3\. Customer Obligations.

3.1 _Compliance._ Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and its End Users' use of the Services comply with the Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify Whatbox of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, Account, or Customer's password of which Customer becomes aware. Whatbox reserves the right to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer Applications, Hosted Data, or Projects.

3.2 _Privacy._ Customer is responsible for any consents and notices required to permit (a) Customer's use and receipt of the Services and (b) Whatbox's accessing, storing, and processing of data provided by Customer (including Hosted Data, if applicable) under the Agreement.

3.3 _Restrictions._ Customer will not, and will not allow End Users to, (a) copy, modify, or create a derivative work of the Services; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of, the Services (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (c) sell, resell, sublicense, transfer, or distribute any or all of the Services; or (d) access or use the Services (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in violation of the AUP; (iii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees (including creating multiple Customer Applications, Accounts, or Projects to simulate or act as a single Customer Application, Account, or Project (respectively)) or to circumvent Service-specific usage limits or quotas; (iv) in a manner that breaches, or causes the breach of, Export Control Laws; or (v) to transmit, store, or process health information subject to Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) regulations.

3.4 _Documentation._ Whatbox may provide Documentation for Customer's use of the Services.

3.5 _Copyright._ Whatbox responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online service providers under the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42.

3.6 _Data Backup & Recovery._ Customer is responsible for independent backup of data stored on Whatbox's servers; unless Customer has arranged for Services which include backup services in which case data backup will be performed under the terms of the specific data backup plan chosen by Customer. Whatbox shall never be held liable for failure to recover data in the event of any sort of failure, and shall never be held accountable financially or otherwise for loss of data.

### 4\. Suspension

4.1 _AUP Violations._ If Whatbox becomes aware that Customer's or any End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Whatbox will notify Customer and request that Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of Whatbox's request, then Whatbox may Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the violation is corrected.

4.2 _Other Suspension._ Notwithstanding [Section 4.1 (AUP Violations)](#4.1), Whatbox may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services if (a) Whatbox reasonably believes Customer's or any End User's use of the Services could adversely impact the Services, other customers' or their end users' use of the Services, or the Whatbox network or servers used to provide the Services; (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) Whatbox reasonably believes that immediate Suspension is required to comply with any applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of [Section 3.3 (Restrictions)](#3.3).

At Customer's request, Whatbox will, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.
