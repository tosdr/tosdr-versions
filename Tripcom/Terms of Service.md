4)  GENERAL BOOKING TERMS (APPLY TO ALL TRAVEL PRODUCTS)
========================================================

**DETAILS AND PRICE**

You confirm that all details provided by you when making your booking (such as name, ID details, contact details, payment details and dates) are accurate and complete. If you notify us of any incorrect details provided by you by mistake, we will help you try and change the details on the booking however we cannot guarantee that the Supplier will permit this, in particular where a change could amount to a change in identity.   

We advertise a large number of Travel Products and we try hard to ensure that the advertised price is always accurate, but sometimes errors do occur. If the error should reasonably have been apparent to you, we reserve the right to cancel the booking or (if agreed by you) change the price. If this happens, we will contact you.

**BOOKING PROCESS**

When your booking is complete, you will receive a confirmation email from us. You agree to check the details in the booking confirmation and to contact us immediately if any of the details are incorrect. More information on flight and hotel booking confirmations is in the relevant sections below.

We will assign a Trip.com booking number to your booking. It will help us if you can tell us the Trip.com booking whenever you contact us about your booking.

When using our booking services you shall not:

•       Use an invalid bank card or account, or a bank card or account that you are not authorised to use.

•       Impersonate any person, or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person.

•       Violate any laws and regulations or regulatory requirements.

All bookings for Travel Products are subject to availability at the time of booking. We try hard to make sure that our Website is kept up to date, but we do not guarantee that any of the Travel Products on our Website will still be available at the time of booking. We will inform you as soon as possible after you place a booking if, for any reason, the Travel Product you have sought to book with us is not available.

We reserve the right to require additional information or verifications to validate or confirm your booking. If you do not provide the requested information or if we find the provided information unsatisfactory, your booking request will be considered incomplete and subsequently cancelled. It is important to note that there is a possibility of a product becoming unavailable during our check, which may result in the booking no longer being available. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be held liable for any loss or cost in any such circumstances.

**PAYMENT AND CURRENCY**

When you book a Travel Product, the terms of payment will be made clear to you during the booking process. Some bookings require you to prepay online, some require you to pay at the time of using the Travel Product (for e.g., when you check-in at a hotel). If any sum is not paid in full in accordance with the terms of your booking, we may cancel your booking immediately. This includes situations where a user pattern or a booking shows signs of fraud, or where the payment instrument may not be charged for any reason.

Exchange rates are calculated in real time. When you prepay online, you will pay the exact amount shown on the payment page. However, if you are paying in a different currency, the provider of the account you pay with may use an alternative currency rate which you are responsible for confirming. Your account provider may also charge you a fee for international payments. You acknowledge that when you pay at the time of using the Travel Product (for e.g., when you check-in at a hotel) the exchange rate may have changed between the time of booking and the time of payment.

If you encounter a problem when you submit your payment, please do not submit the payment again. You can confirm whether your booking was successfully made by contacting us using the details in section 1 of these terms.

Any refunds will be paid back to the original payment method, unless we agree otherwise. The date that any refund will be paid into your account is subject to the provider of your account. 

We take the security of your personal and payment information seriously and have robust measures in place to ensure that your details are kept safe.

**TRAVEL PREPARATIONS**

It is your responsibility to ensure that you have appropriate insurance and the required travel documents for your trip. This includes (but is not limited to) your passport/national ID card, visas, and medical documents (such as proof of vaccinations).

By offering Travel Products to or in a particular destination, we are not advising or confirming that you can travel to and/or around that destination without risk. You are responsible for checking for any travel warnings or restrictions in the destination you are travelling to and/or around, both before you book and before you travel.

5)  FLIGHT TERMS
================

**AIRLINE’S TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

As highlighted under “About these terms”, your booking is also subject to the relevant Supplier’s (in this case the airline’s) terms and conditions. These can generally be found on the airline’s own website. If there are any inconsistencies between these terms and the airline’s terms and conditions, for e.g. where you have selected a cheaper flight ticket that cannot be changed or refunded, these terms will apply. If you have any questions on the terms and conditions that apply to your flight ticket (for e.g. on the change/cancellation/baggage allowance rules), you can contact us directly (using the details in section 1 of these terms) as part of our customer support services.

**BOOKING PROCESS**

Once payment is confirmed, you will receive a “Flight Payment Successful” email from us. You agree to check the details in the email and to inform us immediately if any of the details are incorrect. We shall use reasonable endeavors to issue your flight ticket within the time frame we notified you of during your booking process, and as set out in the “Flight Payment Successful” email. If your flight ticket is not issued within this time frame, please contact us using the details in section 1 of these terms.  

When your flight ticket is issued, you will receive a “Flight Booking Confirmed” email from us which will also include your travel itinerary and an e-receipt. Sometimes, where you have selected a cheaper flight ticket, it might take a little longer for your flight ticket to be issued, but it will be issued no later than 72 hours before your flight is scheduled to depart. Also, when you book a flight ticket within the 3 days before the flight is scheduled to depart, your ticket will be issued in the 72 hours before departure. In both cases, we will have highlighted this to you during your booking process.

When you check-in for your flight, your flight ticket will be in the form on an e-ticket.

We will assign a Trip.com booking number to your booking and tell you what it is in your “Flight Payment Successful” email. It will help us if you can tell us the Trip.com booking number whenever you contact us about your booking. When your flight ticket is issued, we will also provide you with the airline’s booking reference (or similar) in the “Flight Booking Confirmed” email.

**CHANGING OR CANCELLING YOUR BOOKING**

We will have provided you with information on your rights to change or cancel your flight ticket (and any associated fees) during your booking process; you may have selected a cheaper flight ticket that cannot be changed or refunded. This information forms part of these terms and should be read carefully before finalizing your booking. You can also find this this information via a link in your “Flight Booking Confirmed” email or by logging in to your account on our Website and viewing your booking details. If you are unsure whether your flight ticket permits changes and/or refunds for cancellation, please contact us using the details in section 1 of these terms.

Where your flight ticket permits changes and/or refunds for cancellation, you can request this in the booking details section when you log in to your account on our Website or by contacting us using the details in section 1 of these terms.

If you do not have a Trip.com account, you can view your booking details and (where permitted) make a request to change or get a refund for your flight ticket on our Website using the email address you booked with.

When your flight ticket permits changes, the flights that you can change to may be limited by the airline or the third party flight ticket provider, and so all of the options on our Website may not be available to you. We will provide you with information on the available options when we receive your request to change your flight ticket.

If your flight ticket is changed or cancelled by the relevant airline, generally that airline’s terms and conditions will apply. Please contact us directly (using the details in section 1 of these terms) and we will help as part of our customer support services.
