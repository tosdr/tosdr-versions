Roblox Name and Logo - Community Usage Guidelines
=================================================

**Welcome to Roblox’s Name and Logo - Community Usage Guidelines, where you can find brand guidelines and downloadable assets to use when promoting your Experience.**

Brand Guidelines and Assets
---------------------------

Roblox provides the “Now on Roblox” badge seen below so that everyone can clearly and visually explain that their Experience is on Roblox. Creators (including brand partners) can use the “Now on Roblox” badge for all digital promotions off of the Roblox platform as long as they abide by the **[usage guidelines](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/article_attachments/16896241155348)**. However, we require prior approval to use the badge in any offline promotions (i.e., billboards, signs, TV, print). You can submit a request for use in offline promotions [**HERE**](https://corp.roblox.com/request-approval/).

Before downloading and using the “Now on Roblox” badge, please review our terms below and the complete usage guidelines around sizing, color, treatment, etc. Besides our official badge, we do **not permit** the general use of our logo in any creative or copy. Roblox reserves the right to take appropriate action against any improper use of our marks.

**[\>>> Download vector files of the badge here.](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/article_attachments/16302323045908)**

Marks that are prohibited for use
---------------------------------

1. **The Roblox Logo and Roblox Tilt** are not permitted for general use on any creative materials or copy (unless it’s part of the Official Badge). Logo use is strictly limited to select partners and the [**Roblox Stars Influencer Program**](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/360026092011). We do not grant unsolicited requests to use our logos.  
    ![Brand](/hc/article_attachments/16307896268948)
2. **The name “Roblox” and any name similar to Roblox including “Blox”** (and Roblox will determine what is similar) are not permitted in titles of any Experience created on or after June 22, 2022 (titles of Experiences containing Roblox or a name similar to Roblox that were published on the platform before such date are not affected by this prohibition). For example, titles such as “Roblox World” or “Bloxtun Express” would be prohibited.
3. **The use of the Roblox name (and any name similar to Roblox), badge, logo, and other trademarks including “Classic Roblox Avatars” (R6 and R15 Avatars as defined in our Terms of Use)** is not permitted on physical products or commercial content and may not be tied to the development, distribution or sale of any products or services (including, but not limited to, physical products, packaging, retail displays, services, NFTs, film, TV, books, stage shows or amusement parks) without a Roblox licensing agreement.

**Exceptions are made for educational use: (please submit book covers for approval [FORM](https://corp.roblox.com/request-approval/))**

* **Education and Research:** We will allow the use of the Roblox name and trademark for approved “education and research” publications specifically for schools, colleges, universities, and libraries engaged in non-profit instruction and research for education. Please review **[TOU](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846)**.
* **Books about how to code or program on Roblox** are not allowed to use the Roblox logo but may use Roblox name in the title as long as it is not the first word and the cover is labeled UNOFFICIAL. Please review **[TOU](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846)**.
