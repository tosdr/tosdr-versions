Developer Exchange Terms of Use
===============================

The Roblox Developer Exchange Program (also known as DevEx) is a program that allows Roblox creators to exchange their Earned Robux for real money. While any creator can use Roblox Studio to learn to code, create experiences or items to enjoy with their friends, and even earn some Robux, only successful creators will be able to meet the high requirements (described below) to earn money through DevEx. Reaching this level of success typically requires a lot of time, effort, skill, and strategy. Even then, there is no guarantee of earning money. Regardless of goals, be it fun or career advancement, we offer creators what they need to start building for free at [create.roblox.com](https://create.roblox.com/).

1. Acceptance of Terms
    
    Below are the terms and conditions that govern DevEx (“the DevEx Terms”). These DevEx Terms are part of the Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846), which define some of the capitalized words used below. You must agree to the Terms of Use, which include these DevEx Terms, to participate in DevEx.
    
2. DevEx Eligibility Requirements
    
    Eligibility to participate in DevEx is solely up to Roblox, and the requirements may be changed by Roblox at any time by updating the DevEx Terms. To participate in DevEx you must meet all the following minimum requirements (“the DevEx Eligibility Requirements”):
    
    1. Be at least 13 years of age or older;
    2. Have at least 30,000 Earned Robux (defined below) in your account;
    3. Have a Roblox-verified email address;
    4. Have a Roblox-verified email address;
    5. Have a valid [DevEx portal account](https://suppliers.tipalti.com/Roblox/Account/Login);
    6. Have an IRS form W-9 (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 (for non-U.S. taxpayers) on file with Roblox;
    7. Comply with the Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers (described below); and
    8. Be in complete compliance at all times with the Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846), which include these DevEx Terms and the [Roblox Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410). By way of example, the following will disqualify you from DevEx: scamming, phishing, false advertising, attempting to exchange Robux for real currency other than through DevEx, and any illegal or unethical activities.
    
3. Amount eligible to cash out
    
    We will determine how much you are eligible to Cash Out by totaling the amount of Robux earned (over the lifetime of the account) and subtracting the amounts previously paid out to you through DevEx.
    
4. Earned Robux
    
    “Earned Robux” only include Robux you have earned in complete compliance with the Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846), which include the [Roblox Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410), through the Services from the direct sale or other monetization (e.g., EBP) of Virtual Content or other UGC that they create (either alone or with a Group) on the Services. Robux acquired in other ways (such as Robux obtained from a membership plan or referral bonus, a purchase of Robux or gift card, or trading/selling virtual goods that you did not create) are not Earned Robux.
    
5. Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers
    
    To participate in DevEx, you must meet the “Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers,” which are to provide an on-going services that complies with the Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846), including the [Roblox Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410), and any instructions you receive from Roblox. As part of this requirement, you must do the following:
    
    1. Work with Roblox and Roblox users to resolve any issues involving the Roblox [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846) and [Roblox Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410);
    2. Update your Virtual Content for security and technical reasons and ensure your content complies with Roblox’s latest technical and security updates and best practices; and
    3. Assist Roblox upon request with legal requirements, such as removing Virtual Content that has been accused of violating copyright laws.
    
6. Cash Out
    
    A “Cash Out” is an option to exchange your Earned Robux for U.S. dollars at the “Current Exchange Rate for Cash Out” set forth below, which rate is subject to change at any time by Roblox by updating the DevEx Terms. If you satisfy all the DevEx Eligibility Requirements, Roblox will decide in its sole discretion whether to offer you a Cash Out and how much you are eligible to receive in a Cash Out. Under normal circumstances, a Cash Out will total the amount of Earned Robux you obtained over the lifetime of the account minus all Earned Robux previously exchanged by you through DevEx and any Earned Robux you spent on the Services. Further information on the Cash Out process can be found at the [DevEx help page](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314100). The following additional limitations apply to Cash Outs:
    
    1. The Current Exchange Rate for Cash Out is $0.0035U.S. Dollars per Earned Robux. Information on rates applicable to Robux earned before March 1, 2017 is available [here](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/13061189551124).
    2. You are not allowed to initiate a Cash Out more than once a month.
    3. Eligibility to Cash Out is reviewed after you submit a request to Cash Out.
    4. When you initiate Cash Out, Roblox will perform a close review of activities on your account to confirm that you earned Robux in compliance with Terms of Use and Roblox Community Standards. We are not able to predetermine your eligibility for Cash Out.
    
7. Acknowledgements and Further Agreements
    
    In order to participate in DevEx, you further acknowledge and agree to the following:
    
    1. Clicking the “Cash Out” button does not guarantee that you are eligible to, in fact, Cash Out. When you click that button, Roblox will then determine whether you meet the DevEx Eligibility Requirements and whether to provide a Cash Out at Roblox's discretion.
    2. Prior to any payments being made, Roblox requires you to have an IRS form W-9 (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 (for non-U.S. taxpayers) on file with us. All payments made to U.S. users (other than for certain limited exceptions due to reporting requirements) will be reported to the IRS and to you using a form 1099. Payments made to non-U.S. users will not be reported to their home countries.
    3. Transaction fees are assessed on each payment (which will be paid from any amounts that would otherwise be owed to you hereunder). These fees are charged by our DevEx portal provider (Roblox does not assess any fees in addition to those charged by our provider), and vary depending on payment method chosen. Please see the [DevEx portal](https://suppliers.tipalti.com/Roblox/Account/Login) for information regarding fee schedules.
    4. You are responsible for any taxes that may be owed due to a Cash Out. Roblox considers the Cash Out payments to be payments for the services you have provided. All participants (whether you live in the US or elsewhere) are responsible for ensuring that all payments received are reported to the proper taxing authorities. Income that Minors earn can impact their parents’ tax returns.
    5. We are not able to remit payments to certain countries, entities, or individuals because of legal or other considerations. But we are currently able to make payments to DevEx participants in over one hundred different countries. Check [here](https://support.tipalti.com/Content/Topics/UserGuide/PaymentInformation/PaymentMethodsCoverage/IntroUSD.htm?Highlight=payment%20methods) to see if your country is on the list.
    6. If your Roblox account is inactive (i.e. no authenticated sessions on the Roblox platform) for a period of two and a half years or more, your account will be considered inactive and ineligible to participate in DevEx, and you will need to re-apply should you wish to participate again.
    7. Roblox reserves the right to modify, amend, or cancel the DevEx Program, add, remove, or modify the DevEx Eligibility Requirements, and change the Current Exchange Rate for Cash Out, all at any time and for any reason by updating the DevEx Terms. The existence of the DevEx Program today in no way creates an obligation for us to continue the program in the future, nor does it guarantee that Earned Robux can be exchanged in the future. We reserve the right to review activity on accounts to assess the validity of Earned Robux balances, and to deny payment to any user that we feel has violated the terms or the spirit of our program, including but not limited to these DevEx Terms, the Roblox Terms of Use, and the Roblox Community Standards.
