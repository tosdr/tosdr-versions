[Home](https://4-h.org/) ![](https://4-h.org/wp-content/themes/4h/assets/images/icons/breadcrumbs-separator.svg) Privacy Policy | Donor Privacy Policy

You have arrived at 4-h.org and/or are otherwise interacting with a web site or online service (“**Site**”) owned and operated by the National 4H Council (“**4H** or “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”). Certain information about you is collected when you use the Site. Some of the information collected may be “**Personal Information**” – information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other available information. Other information may be non-identifiable.

This Online Privacy Statement (this “Statement”) applies to the Site and explains what information may be collected through your use of the Site, why the Site collects such information, how your information is protected, and the choices you have about how your information is used. This Online Privacy Statement does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Site (unless otherwise stated), and does not govern the data practices of third parties that may interact with our Site. If you are a 4H donor, please refer to our [DONOR PRIVACY POLICY](https://4-h.org/privacy-policy/#donor), which governs our collection of donor information both online and offline. Please review the “Children’s Privacy” section below for details on 4-H’s information collection, use, and sharing practices related to information collected from children.

This Online Privacy Statement is part of the [TERMS & CONDITIONS](https://4-h.org/terms-and-conditions/) that govern your use of the Site. By using the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Statement. If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information as described in this Statement, you may not use the Site.

This Statement may be supplemented or amended from time to time by privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”) provided at the time your information is collected. For example, certain pages of the Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information collected on those particular pages, why the Site needs that information, and choices you may have about the ways the Site uses that information.

### 1\. Changes to this Statement

We reserve the right to update or modify this Statement and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Statement or Privacy Notice on this Site. These changes will only apply to the information the Site collects after we have posted the revised Statement or Privacy Notice on this Site.  Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you after the revised Statement is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Statement. You may access the current version of this Statement at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy Policy” within the site.

### 2\. Information Collection

**2.1 Contact and Demographic Information.** On the Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) contact information, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, and home address; and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender, age, education level, occupation, zip code, etc. (“**Demographic Information**”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Site, including at account registration.

**2.2 Account Registration.** In order to have full access to this Web site and to affiliated web sites, a user may be requested to complete a registration form which will require certain contact information. This information is used to contact the user about the services for which they have expressed interest. In addition, a user may be asked to provide, at the user’s option, certain Demographic Information, which will assist us in providing a more personalized experience. By registering, you may receive email communications from National 4H Council and/or from your state 4H office.

**2.3 User-Generated Content.** As further described in the [TERMS & CONDITIONS](https://4-h.org/terms-conditions/), you may be able to submit User-Generated Content through the Site via your profile, forums, blogs, message boards, social networking environments, content creation tools, gameplay, social communities, contact us tools, email, and other communications functionality.

**2.4 Usage Information.** In addition to any information you chose to submit to us via the Site, we and our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store and collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“**Usage Information**”). This may include:

* _Information Automatically Sent by Your Web Browser._ Information is sent to the Site automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. The information the Site receives depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. The information the Site receives from your web browser is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable. Generally, this information is used in the aggregate to help us improve the Site and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, we may combine this information with other information that does identify you. We may also review our server logs for security purposes—for example, to detect intrusions into the Site—and we might share our server logs, which contain visitors’ IP addresses, with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you. 
* _Information From Your Mobile or Tablet Device._ Likewise, if you access the Site through your mobile device, the Site may automatically collect certain information from or about your device. The types of information the Site may collect includes the type of device you use, the IP address of your device, your device’s operating system, the type of mobile or tablet Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use our Site. This information is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may combine it with other information that does identify you. 
* _Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies._ The Site uses “cookies” and other technologies to collect information and to support certain features. For example, the Site may use these technologies to:
* collect information about the ways visitors use the site—which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;
* support the features and functionality of the site—for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information you have previously provided to us or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits; and
* personalize your experience.  The information the Service collects using cookies and similar technologies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may combine it with other information that does identify you.

**2.5 Combining Information from Multiple Sources.** We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Site, such as when they submit content to us (or post) on the Site. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Site with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Online Privacy Statement to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

Once you, as an adult, have registered for an account and been authenticated, you may register your own child(ren) for account access. Adults provide 4-H with basic information about the child and allow the child to use the adult’s account on the adult’s devices. 4-H then collects information about the device, the account log in information, information related to the status of the child’s completion of the activities offered through the services, and related Usage Information.

We may also share this information in connection with business transfers, to comply with laws, protect our rights and the rights of others, and with the appropriate adult’s consent. Our services do not allow children to make personal information publicly available.

Parents or legal guardians may login to their own accounts  to review their child’s information, keep their child’s information accurate, current, and complete, delete their child’s information, or restrict us from further collecting or using their child’s information.
