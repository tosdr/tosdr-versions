By using this Site or by downloading any information from or by uploading any information to this Site, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions set forth below. If you are a parent or legal guardian and you allow your child to use the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms in respect of their use of the Site. Additionally, this Site may contain other terms and conditions that govern particular features, offers, sales or products (“**Additional Terms**”).

If you do not agree to abide by these terms and conditions, do not use this Site or download/upload Content (as defined below).

These Terms, the accompanying [PRIVACY POLICY](https://4-h.org/privacy-policy/) and any Additional Terms contained in the Site constitute the entire agreement (collectively, “the Agreement”) between us with respect to your use of the Site and the Content.

The most recent date of any material changes to these Terms will be indicated by the “Last Modified” date at the top of the page. Changes will be effective when notice of such change is posted on the Site. Your continued use of the Site after any changes are posted will be considered acceptance of those changes. Your access to this Site for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Agreement does not constitute your acceptance unless you make any further use of the Site.

You should frequently check the email you associated with your account for notices, and you agree that the means set forth in these Terms are all reasonable manners of providing you with notice. You can reject any new, revised or additional terms and conditions by discontinuing your use of the Site.

### 4\. Accounts

In order to access or use some (or potentially all) of the features on the Site, you may need to first register through our online registration process (“**Account**”). The Site’s practices governing any resulting collection, use, disclosure and management of your personal information are disclosed in its [PRIVACY POLICY](https://4-h.org/privacy-policy/).

If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username, then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an email notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You will not use a username (or email address) that is already being used by someone else, may impersonate another person, belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or is offensive. We may reject the use of any password, username, or email address for any other reason in our sole discretion; (ii) You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and, as permitted, maintain and update it (including on your profile page) promptly when necessary to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (iii) You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, password, and username – whether or not you authorized the activity; (iv) You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your Device so that others may not access any password protected portion of the Site using your name, username, or password; (v) You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account, password, or username, or any other breach of security; and (vi) You will not sell, transfer, or assign your Account or any Account rights.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and under any legal theory) to you or any third party arising from your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.

If any information that you provide, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information that you provide, is false, inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or violates these Terms, any applicable Additional Terms, or any applicable law, then we may suspend or terminate your Account. We also reserve the more general and broad right to terminate your Account or suspend or otherwise deny you access to it or its benefits – all in our sole discretion, for any reason, and without advance notice or liability.

### 5\. Additional Terms Applicable to Premium Services

Certain parts of our Site may be accessible only by users with an active subscription to access our Premium Services.

**5.1 Account Fees.** 4-H may charge a Subscription Fee for access to certain Premium Services. All fees are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time when the fee becomes payable. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.

**5.2 Authorization to Charge for Use of Services.** You must provide accurate and complete information for a valid payment method that you are authorized to use (such as a credit card or other payment method accepted by us to activate and maintain an account). You authorize 4-H to charge you through the payment method that you use when you register for access to Premium Services. You are also responsible for charges for any products or services ordered through your account that are offered for sale through our Site. If we do not receive payment via your payment method, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon our demand and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. If the payment method you provide is initially declined for any reason, we reserve the right to charge the payment method (credit card or other accepted mechanism) in installments, at the non-promotional/non-discounted rate that is in place at the time, for the full duration of the subscription that you have selected. You bear sole responsibility for all overdraft fees or other penalties that may be assessed by your payment provider. You are responsible for any use of your credit card or other payment instrument (e.g. PayPal).

**5.3 Subscription Renewal.** If you purchase a recurring subscription, you are subscribing to an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated frequency (e.g., monthly or annual) until cancelled. You will be charged your first subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue at the selected interval, and you will continue to be charged at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), unless at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period: (a) you terminate your account; (b) you cancel your subscription (as described below); (c) we decline to renew your subscription; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. The Subscription Fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in accordance with applicable law. If any subscription fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your access to the Premium Services or cancel your subscription. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts.

**5.5 Subscription Cancellations.** When you cancel a subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription. You may initiate your cancellation at any time, but the cancellation will become effective at the end of your current subscription period. In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours prior to the end of your current subscription period. You may cancel your subscription by visiting our website at 4-h.org. \[INSERT INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANCELLING A SUBSCRIPTION.\] After canceling a subscription, you will continue to have access to Premium Services for the interval of time that has already been prepaid. 4-H does not provide full or partial refunds for prepaid subscription intervals, regardless of duration.  4-H does not accept returns of products purchased under a subscription plan.

**5.6 No Refunds.** EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE and if you cancel your subscription, you will not receive any refund and you will continue to have access to the Premium Services. We reserve the right to issue refunds, credits, or discounts at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund, credit, or discount, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future

**5.7 Free Trials and Promotional Rates.** We may offer promotional trial subscriptions to obtain access to our Premium Services for free or at a promotional rate. If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial, you will be required to provide a credit card or other payment method in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled your subscription. You may cancel your subscription during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above.

If your subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the promotional rate for the relevant number of billing periods and upon completion of that period, your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the full rate.

Depending on the terms of the specific promotional offer, you may only be permitted to use one free trial or discounted price offer. If your subscription is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or to take advantage of another discounted price offer.

**5.8 Termination.** We may terminate your subscription at our sole discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your subscription, we may give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining that you cannot use; provided, however, that we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Premium Services violate these Terms, any applicable law, or has harmed another user.

**5.9 Changes to the Subscription.** We may change the subscription terms or Subscription Fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a subscription. Your continued use of the Premium Services after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your subscription.

4H has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User-Generated Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User-Generated Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at 4H’s cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint 4H as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest).

As a user of the Site, these Community Usage Rules (“**Rules**”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Site’s online communities (“**Communities**”).

Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:

* Your User-Generated Content. All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms. Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties. Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet. If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to 4H. (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to 4H as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.)
* Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family. If you choose to submit photos to the Site, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
* Act Appropriately. All of your Site activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy. If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the Site. Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or physical handicap. Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit. Your User-Generated Content must not exploit children under the age of 18.
* Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes. Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.
* Do Not Use to Solicit or Send Unwanted Communications. Do not harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of others from the Site by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications. Do not solicit personal information from anyone or solicit passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes. This also includes not uploading, posting, transmitting, sharing or otherwise making available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation.
* Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes. Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
* Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.
* Others Can See. We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members. However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Site within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users. Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.
* Don’t Share Other People’s Personal Content. Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by 4H (e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).
* Don’t Damage the Site or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices. Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Site or any computer or other Device.

If you submit User-Generated Content that 4H reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion. However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law. We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Site.

### 7\. Procedure For Alleging Copyright Infringement

4H asks our users to respect the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to respond appropriately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, as set forth more fully below. In 4H’s sole discretion, 4H may remove content that may be infringing on another person’s intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer. In accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”) and other applicable law, 4H has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

If we remove or disable access in response to a **DMCA Notice** (as defined below), we will make a good faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter-notification. If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner’s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Site, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:

(i) a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice”;

(ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;

(iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Site on which the material appears);

(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, and email address;

(v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;

(vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and

(vii) your electronic or physical signature.

4H will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, email, or facsimile at the addresses below:

**By Mail:**

National 4-H Council  
655 15th Street NW  
Suite 220  
Washington, DC 20005

**By Email:** [HTTPS://4H.ORG/CONTACT/](http://https//4H.ORG/CONTACT/)

It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. 4H may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and 4H may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly and materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.

We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.

Without limiting 4H’s other rights, 4H may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by 4H.

If access on the Site to a work that you submitted to 4H is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above. Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:

(i) a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Counter-Notification”;

(ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Site from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);

(iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;

(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your account;

(v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and

(vi) your electronic or physical signature.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site. You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

### 8\. Third Party Sites/Links

As a convenience to you, links to Web sites operated by others may be provided to you. The Site may also contain or may interact with or otherwise be associated with third party platforms, services, plug-ins, applications, ads, tools and/or other content, and/or links to third-party websites or other services that are not owned, controlled or operated by 4H (collectively, “**Third-Party Services**”), including services operated by advertisers, licensors, licensees, e-commerce partners and certain other third parties who may have business relationships with 4H. This may include the ability to register or sign in to our Site using Facebook Connect or other third party tools, and to post content on third party sites and services using their plug-ins made available on our Site. We may also host our content, apps and tools on Third Party Services.

4H may have no control over the content, operations, policies, terms, or other elements of Third Party Services, and 4H does not assume any obligation to review any Third Party Services. 4H does not necessarily endorse, approve, or sponsor any Third Party Services, or any third-party content, advertising, information, materials, products, services, or other items. Furthermore, 4H is not responsible for the quality or delivery of the products or services offered, accessed, obtained by or advertised at such Third Party Services. Some Third Party Services may impose fees for access to their resources through our Site and/or your Account and you are responsible for all such fees.

Finally, we will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damage, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within these Third Party Services. Any activities you engage in connection with any of the same are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use and/or sale, and rules issued by the operator of the Third Party Services. 4H disclaims all liability in connection therewith.

Any interactions, correspondence, transactions, and other dealings that you have with any third parties found on or through the Site (including on or via Third Party Services or advertisements) are solely between you and the third party (including issues related to the content of third-party advertisements, payments, delivery of goods, warranties (including product warranties), privacy and data security, and the like). By logging into or enabling Third Party Services within or in connection with your Account, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these providers for this purpose. You hereby agree to indemnify 4H against all claims, injury and/or damages including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, that arise out of your use of any Third Party Service, including without limitation from any material that you post on any forum or social networking site in connection with us and/or any other claim related to your use of social media.

You hereby grant 4H an irrevocable, perpetual license to use, reproduce, edit, create derivative works from, distribute, display, copy, transmit or otherwise use in any way, commercially or otherwise, any material that you post to any social networking site or other Third Party Service in connection with us or our Site.

### 9\. Dispute Resolution

Except as specifically stated herein, you agree that any disputes, actions, and claims relating to your use of the Site and all matters arising out of or related to the Agreement (including any applicable Additional Terms) (collectively “**Disputes**” or a “**Dispute**”) that are not resolved informally shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration, except that you may assert claims in small claims court in the county of your residence or in Chevy Chase, Maryland, if your claims qualify.

**9.1**  **Informal Negotiation.** In the event of a Dispute, you and 4-H agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a dispute informally. The claiming party must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving the notice, detailed factual information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party’s individualized claim, and the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. You must send any notice of dispute to National 4H Council, 5425 Wisconsin Ave, Suite 600,  
Chevy Chase, MD 20815, Attn: \[INSERT\]. We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and 4-H will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days beginning from the date the notice of dispute is sent. This informal negotiation requires an individual meet–and-confer in person, telephonically, or via videoconference that addresses only the dispute between you and us. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also need to individually participate. 4-H will participate in the conference through one or more representatives, which may include our counsel. After the end of the sixty (60) day informal negotiation period and not before, and only after the completion of the dispute resolution conference with respect to a claim, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding regarding that claim. Alternatively, you may litigate a dispute in small claims court immediately if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court and you proceed only on an individual basis, whether or not you first negotiated informally or completed a dispute resolution conference. However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s claims before, during, or after any dispute resolution conference or filing in small claims court.

**9.2 Binding Arbitration**. If you, on one hand, and 4-H, on the other, do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation, the dispute shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration, except that you may assert claims in small claims court in the county of your residence or in Chevy Chase, Maryland, if your claims qualify. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its rules, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. All of the AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org, and the rules governing consumer disputes are available at www.adr.org/consumer. The AAA’s rules, including the rules governing consumer disputes, are also available by calling 1-800-778-7879. You may initiate arbitration by utilizing the forms available on www.adr.org. If you have any difficulty initiating arbitration, you may call the AAA at 800-778-7879. You and 4H are each giving up the right to have disputes resolved in court before a judge and/or jury (except as stated otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section). The Federal Arbitration Act, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes between 4-H and you. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, interpretation, and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, including the arbitration and class action waiver provisions, are for the court to decide. The most current version of this Dispute Resolution Section in effect when any Dispute arises shall govern resolution of any Dispute. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (“**Arbitration Fees**”) will be governed by the AAA’s rules. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The arbitration will be conducted based on written submissions unless you request a phone or in-person hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a phone or in-person hearing is necessary. The arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Dispute Resolution Section.

**9.3 Limited Time To File Claims**. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

**9.4 Injunctive Relief**. The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section will not apply to any legal action taken by 4H to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in emergent circumstances in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or 4H’s intellectual property rights, 4H’s operations, and/or 4H’s products or services.

**9.5 No Class Action Matters**. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. YOU AND 4H AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in this Dispute Resolution Section to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to this Dispute Resolution Section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Dispute Resolution Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, including the class action waiver provisions contained herein, are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.

**9.6 Federal and State Courts in Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland**. Except to the extent that arbitration is required in this Dispute Resolution Section, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland. Accordingly, you and 4H consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.

**9.7 Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claims of Disputes in small claims court, subject to this Dispute Resolution Section.

**WINNER NOTIFICATION & VERIFICATION:** Potential winners will be notified by Sponsor via direct message and/or comment reply to his/her Facebook account used to enter (the “Initial Notification”) on or about Thursday, October 28, 2021. To begin the prize claim process, a potential winner must respond as instructed to the Notification with his/her full name, address, email address and date of birth within 48 hours of the Initial Notification. Any potential prize winner who does not reply to the Notification with the required information and within the specified time period will be disqualified and an alternate winner will be notified. Potential Grand Prize winner will then be notified via email and/or phone, and will be required to sign and return, within five (5) days of notification, an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Waiver, an IRS W-9 Form and where allowable, a Publicity Release (collectively, “the Releases”). These Releases will require the Grand Prize winner to furnish his/her Social Security Number for the sole purpose of tax reporting, as required by law. Noncompliance will result in disqualification and an alternate winner may be selected. The prizes will be awarded to the address provided by the winners within approximately 45 days after the winner is verified.

If a winner is otherwise eligible under these Official Rules but is nevertheless deemed a minor in his or her state of primary residence, the prize will be awarded in the name of winner’s parent or legal guardian who will be required to execute and return the Releases on minor’s behalf, as applicable.

If a prize notification or prize is returned as undeliverable, or if winner is found to be ineligible or not in compliance with these rules that winner will be disqualified, and the prize may be awarded to an alternate winner in a separate random drawing. If Sponsor is unable to determine and verify a potential winner after repeated alternate drawings or if Sponsor fails to receive a sufficient number of entries to correspond to the number of prizes available to be awarded, Sponsor reserves the right to not award such prize(s).

**PRIZE CONDITIONS:** Prizes are not redeemable for cash, assignable, transferable and may not be substituted except at Sponsor’s sole discretion. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize of equal or greater value at its discretion. Any other incidental expenses on prize not specified herein are the winner’s sole responsibility.

Prepaid cards are not redeemable for cash and will not be replaced if lost or stolen. Prepaid card usage is subject to the issuing company’s complete terms and conditions, including expiration dates.

Winner is responsible for all federal, state, local and income taxes associated with winning prize. Grand Prize winner will be required to furnish his/her Social Security Number for the sole purpose of preparation of tax forms as required by law. Except where prohibited by law, entry and acceptance of prize constitute permission to use winner’s name, prize won, hometown, likeness, video recordings, photographs, and statements for purposes of advertising, promotion and publicity (including online posting) in any and all media now or hereafter known throughout the world in perpetuity, without additional compensation, notification or permission.

If, for any reason, the Sweepstakes cannot be run as planned, Sponsor may disqualify any suspect entries or individuals from the Sweepstakes and any sweepstakes it sponsors and (a) suspend the Sweepstakes and modify the Sweepstakes to address the impairment, then resume the Sweepstakes in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules; and/or (b) award the prize at random from among the eligible, non-suspect entries received up to the time of the impairment.

BY ENTERING THE SWEEPSTAKES, ENTRANT AGREES THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THE SWEEPSTAKES, OR ANY PRIZE AWARDED, WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION; (B) ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS AND AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL THIRD-PARTY, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS INCURRED (IF ANY) NOT TO EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), BUT IN NO EVENT WILL ATTORNEYS’ FEES BE AWARDED OR RECOVERABLE; (C) UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY ENTRANT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN ANY AWARD FOR, AND ENTRANT HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO SEEK, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS AND/OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, OTHER THAN ACTUAL OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES NOT TO EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10.00), AND/OR ANY RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED; AND (D) ENTRANTS’ REMEDIES ARE LIMITED TO A CLAIM FOR MONEY DAMAGES (IF ANY) AND ENTRANT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**DISPUTES:** The parties hereto each agree to finally settle all disputes only through arbitration; provided, however, the Released Parties shall be entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in the state and federal courts in Montgomery County, MD and any other court with jurisdiction over the parties. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and review is limited. The arbitrator’s decision and award is final and binding, with limited exceptions, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The parties agree that, except as set forth above, any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Sweepstakes shall be resolved solely by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator under the streamlined Arbitration Rules Procedures of JAMS Inc. (“JAMS”) or any successor to JAMS. In the event JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within fourteen (14) days of the filing of a “Demand for Arbitration”, then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or any other mutually agreeable arbitration administration service. If an in-person hearing is required, then it will take place in Chevy Chase, MD. The federal or state law that applies to these Official Rules will also apply during the arbitration. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other proceedings that involve any claims or controversy of another party, including any class actions; provided, however, if for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then the agreement to arbitrate doesn’t apply and the dispute must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Chevy Chase, MD. Sponsor agrees to pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees in order to conduct the arbitration (but specifically excluding any travel or other costs of entrant to attend the arbitration hearing). Either party may, notwithstanding this provision, bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
