2\. HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA
----------------------------

We primarily use, store, and process Personal Data to provide, understand, improve, and develop our Platform, create and maintain a trusted and safer environment, and comply with our legal obligations. We also use Personal Data for the purposes set forth below and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.

**2.1 Provide, Maintain, and Support the Platform.** Using Personal Data we collect from you, we are able to deliver the Platform to Users and honor our Terms of Use. We need to use Personal Data you provide to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network, identify you as a User in our system, provide improved administration and quality of experience of our Platform, including to send email, call, or send SMS text messages to you to verify ownership of the email address or phone number provided when your Account was created, send you Platform support or maintenance messages, updates, security alerts, and Account notifications.

Additionally, to provide you technical support, we may need to review your Account and the contents of your Account to identify, research, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues that you report to us or that we otherwise become aware of.

**2.2 Research and Development.** We use Personal Data we collect for research and development purposes, including to study and improve the Platform and our business, to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, and to develop new features, functionality, products, and services. As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from Personal Data we collect. We make Personal Data into anonymous data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including (but not limited to) regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, modeling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.

**2.3 Direct Marketing.** We may process User Personal Data for marketing purposes including offering you products and services that may be of interest to you (such as information about FullContact Data Services or partner campaigns and other third-party services). We may also administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, newsletters, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by FullContact or its third-party partners. Users can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your notification settings within your FullContact Account and as further described in the “YOUR RIGHTS” section below.

**2.4 Interest-Based Advertising.** We work with third-party advertising companies and social media companies to help us advertise our business and to display ads for our Platform. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about Users (including the online activity information and device information described above in paragraph 1.2.c., “Internet or Network Activity”) over time across our Platform and other websites and services or your interaction with our emails, and use that information to serve ads that they think will interest you. In addition, some of these companies may use hashed customer lists that we share with them to deliver ads to you and to similar users on their platforms. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising in the “YOUR RIGHTS” section below.

**2.5 To Comply with Laws and Regulations.** We will use your Personal Data as we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.

**2.6 For Compliance, Fraud Prevention, and Safety.** We may use your Personal Data and disclose it to law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties as we believe necessary or appropriate to: (a) maintain the safety, security, and integrity of the Platform and our business, databases, and other technology assets; (b) protect our, your, or others’ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims); (c) audit our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements and internal policies; (d) enforce the Terms of Use that govern the Platform; and (e) prevent, identify, investigate, and deter fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft.

**2.7 With Your Consent.** We will disclose your Personal Data in accordance with your prior direction or, in some cases, we may specifically ask you for your consent to collect, use, or share your Personal Data, such as when required by law.

**2.8 Combine Contacts for Identity Resolution Services (Resolve).** We combine certain categories of Consumer Personal Data to build more complete contact records of individuals. These Consumer profiles reside in the FullContact identity graph and may be processed for the following purposes in connection with providing Resolve:

* * Grouping contacts and contact elements into unique individuals to create a Consumer profile
    * Generating and returning a unique identifier for an individual and associated Consumer profile
    * Linking (or “matching”) input contact records from our Users to the Consumer profile found in the FullContact identity graph for purposes of identifying an individual, searching for an individual, and/or linking to other contact records associated with the same individual
    * Deduplicating a set of input contact records from our Users based on unique individuals
    * Inferring linkages between and/or deduplicating existing Consumer profiles

For example, someone may search or lookup a contact by name and email address. FullContact connects the name and email with a Consumer profile within the FullContact identity graph for one of the reasons above. No additional Personal Data beyond the unique identifier is returned to the User submitting the search.

**2.9 Combine Contacts for Identity Verification Services (Verify).** Certain categories of Consumer Personal Data may be made available to our Users in connection with providing Verify. Verify provides the accuracy and recency of contact elements contained within input contact records from Users. We compare the input contact records against the FullContact identity graph to provide a risk score to the User.

**2.10 Combine Contacts for Contact Enrichment Services (Enrich).** Certain categories of Consumer Personal Data may be made available to our Users in connection with providing Enrich. Enrich is often utilized in combination with Resolve so that, for example, a User is able to match an input contact record to the Consumer profile within our identity graph, and receive back a subset of the contact information from the relevant Consumer profile for that individual or other contacts’ records linked to the same individual. For example, we may return an individual’s name to support features such as caller ID.

3\. HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA
------------------------------

In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy or at the point of collection, FullContact may share your Personal Data with the entities or persons set forth below.

**3.1 When You Consent, Agree or Direct Us to Share.** You may authorize us to disclose your Personal Data to others, such as when you connect a third-party application or website to access your FullContact Account, when you utilize the Platform’s live chat feature, when you participate in promotional activities conducted by FullContact partners or third parties, or when you exercise consent as requested in the use of our Platform.

**3.2 Professional Advisors.** We may share your Personal Data with persons, companies, or professional firms providing FullContact with advice and consulting in accounting, administrative, legal, tax, financial, debt collection, and other matters.

**3.3 Sweepstakes and Joint Marketing Partners.** We may provide User Personal Data for commercial purposes to business partners in order to provide you with the content and other features through the Platform, and such partners may send you promotional materials or otherwise contact you regarding products or services that they believe may be of interest to you. These parties may include such companies as software and hardware providers, consumer product providers, and marketing coops.

**3.4 Compliance with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm, and Protection of Your or Our Rights.** Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below in “YOUR RIGHTS”), FullContact may disclose your Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation or for the purposes described above in “For Compliance, Fraud Prevention, and Safety”; (b) to comply with applicable laws, including laws outside your country of residence; and (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities (including authorities outside your country of residence) or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on FullContact.

**3.5 Service Providers.** FullContact uses a variety of third-party service providers to help us provide our Platform, such as website hosting, maintenance services, analytics, marketing, customer relationship management and other purposes. For example, to facilitate payments for FullContact Data Services, certain information as described above may be shared with the relevant payments service providers. This payment-related data sharing is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us. FullContact may need to share your Personal Data in order to deliver the Platform to you and honor our Terms of Use.

**3.6 Corporate Affiliates.** To enable or support us in providing the Platform, we may share your Personal Data within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control.

* * **Sharing with FullContact, Inc.** Even if your country of residence is not the United States, your Personal Data may be shared with FullContact, Inc., which provides the technical infrastructure for the Platform, product development and maintenance, customer support, trust and safety and other business operation services to other FullContact affiliates and subsidiaries.
    * **Sharing with FullContact Affiliates and Subsidiaries.** Your Personal Data may be shared with our affiliates and subsidiaries.

4\. PERSONAL DATA RETENTION
---------------------------

We will retain your Personal Data, including sensitive Personal Data, for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of collection, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish and defend legal claims, for fraud prevention purposes, or as long as required to meet our legal obligations.

To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We may transfer, store, and process your Personal Data within our family of companies or with service providers based in countries or other locations outside of your home country. Privacy laws in locations where we handle your Personal Data may differ from and not be as protective as the laws applicable to your country of residence. By providing your providing your Personal Data, where applicable law permits, you specifically and expressly consent to such transfer and processing and the collection, use, and disclosure set forth herein.Users located in Europe can view more information about cross-border transfers in the section below titled “NOTICE TO EUROPEAN RESIDENTS.”

**6.3** **Data Privacy Frameworks.**  FullContact Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. FullContact Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. FullContact Inc. has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. FullContact’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Data Privacy Frameworks and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the DPF Principles. In particular, FullContact remains responsible and liable under the DPF Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless FullContact proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

7\. YOUR RIGHTS
---------------

**7.1 Marketing Emails.** We offer Users choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of their Personal Data. If you are a User of our Platform, we may periodically send you free newsletters and emails that promote our Platform as well as third-party products or services we think you may be interested in. When you receive such promotional newsletters or communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving them from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive or by contacting us directly. Despite your indicated email preferences, we may send you service-related communications, such as those about your FullContact Account.

**7.2 Cookies.** Most browsers let you remove or stop accepting cookies from the websites you visit. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser’s settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Platform and our Platform may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**7.3 Analytics.** The Site uses Google Analytics to help us analyze how the Site is being accessed and used. You can learn more about Google Analytics cookies by clicking [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and about how Google protects your data by clicking [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). To opt-out of Google Analytics, you can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

**7.4 Advertising Choices.** You can limit the use of your information for interest-based advertising by blocking third-party cookies in your browser settings, using browser plug-ins and extensions, or using your mobile device settings to limit the use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device. You can also opt out of interest-based ads from companies participating in the following industry opt-out programs by visiting the linked websites: the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/) or [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) in the U.S., the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](https://youradchoices.ca/choices/) in Canada, or the [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) in Europe. Mobile app users may opt out of receiving behavioral-based advertising in mobile apps provided by participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the [AppChoices mobile app](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices). Some of the companies we work with may offer their own opt-out mechanisms. For example, you can learn more about how Google uses cookies for advertising purposes by clicking [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and opt-out of ad personalization by Google by clicking [here](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en). Many of the opt-out preferences described in this section must be set on each device or browser for which you want them to apply. Please note that some of the advertising companies we work with may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above, so even after opting-out, you may still receive interest-based advertisements from other companies. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.

**7.5 Do Not Track.** Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a ”Do Not Track” signal to the online services that your visit. At this time, we do not modify your experience based upon whether a “Do Not Track” signal is broadcast. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/). Our Site does respond to the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal as described in the “Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Targeted Advertising” section below.

**7.6 Access, Correction, Deletion, and Opt-Out Requests.** FullContact allows any individual, inclusive of both Users and Consumers and regardless of residency, to exercise the following rights with respect to Personal Data that FullContact holds about them. Please note, these rights are not absolute, and, in some cases, we may not be able to respond to your request, such as when a legal exemption applies or if we are not able to verify your identity.

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to request that FullContact confirm whether we process Personal Data about you and to disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Data, including:
    * * The categories of Personal Data we collected about you;
        * The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected;
        * Our business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing (as applicable) that Personal Data; and
        * The categories of third parties with whom we disclose that Personal Data (as applicable).
* **Right to Access/Data Portability.** You have the right to request that FullContact provide you access to your Personal Data, including in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another entity.
* **Right to Delete.** You have the right to request that FullContact delete any of your Personal Data that we have retained about you, subject to certain exceptions.
* **Right to Correct.** You have the right to request that FullContact correct inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data that we maintain about you, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data and the purposes of the processing of the Personal Data.
* **Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Targeted Advertising.** If FullContact sells your Personal Data for monetary or other valuable consideration, or shares your Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising, you have the right to opt-out. You may exercise these rights by visiting the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices)” Portal, or broadcasting the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. Note that due to technological limitations, if you visit our Platform from a different computer or device, or clear cookies on your browser that store your preferences, you will need to return to this Platform to select your preferences or rebroadcast the GPC signal. Additionally, the GPC signal will only opt-out your Personal Data from cross-context behavioral advertising. To opt-out of sales for monetary or other valuable consideration, we may need to collect some identifying information so please submit your request through the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices)” Portal.
* **Right to Limit the Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data.** If FullContact collects or processes sensitive Personal Data for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, you have the right to request that we limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive Personal Data for certain limited permitted purposes by law. We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive Personal Data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please visit the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices)” Portal or emailing us at [privacy@fullcontact.com](mailto:privacy@fullcontact.com). FullContact will process your Right to Limit as a request to delete, thereby removing your Consumer profile from the FullContact identity graph.
* **Right to Revoke Consent and Restrict Processing.** Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your Personal Data by FullContact, you may withdraw your consent at any time specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your Personal Data, in particular where (a) you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data; (b) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the deletion of your Personal Data; (c) we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or (d) you have objected to the processing and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of FullContact override your own.
* **Right to Object to Processing.** In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require FullContact not to process your Personal Data for certain specific purposes, where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will no longer process your Personal Data for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Where your Personal Data is processed either by email or cookies for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time, ask us to cease processing your Personal Data for these direct marketing purposes by changing your preferences [here](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices).
* **Right to Nondiscrimination.** You will not be subject to discrimination as a result of exercising the rights described herein. In some cases, when you exercise one of your rights, we will be unable to comply with the request due to legal obligations or otherwise, or we will be unable to provide you certain products or services. These responses are not discrimination and our reasons for declining your request or ceasing services will be provided at that time.

_How to Exercise Your Request:_ You, or an agent authorized to act on your behalf, may exercise these choices through the mechanisms described above, by emailing us at [privacy@fullcontact.com](mailto:privacy@fullcontact.com), or through our interactive webform available through the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices)” Portal.

_Authorized Agents:_ You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. If you do so, we may require your proof of identification, the authorized agent’s proof of identification, and any other information that we may request in order to verify your request, including evidence of valid permission for the authorized agent to act on your behalf.

_How We Process Your Request:_ When exercising your rights, or when otherwise assisting you, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. This is a security measure to, for example, ensure we do not disclose Personal Data to any person who is not entitled to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee or decline to comply with your request if your request is unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days of your request. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days to respond, for instance if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of the delay, and may continue to update you regarding the progress of our response.

_How to Appeal a Decision Concerning Your Request:_ If we notify you that we will not take action on your request, you may appeal such refusal within a reasonable period after receipt of the notice by following the instructions provided in the notice or by submitting an appeal through the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices)” Portal. We try to respond to appeals within 45 days of receipt. Occasionally, where permitted by law, it may take us longer than 45 days to response based on, for example, the complexity and number of requests serving as the basis for the appeal. We will notify you within the initial 45 days if we need more time to respond to the appeal, together with the reasons for the delay.

8\. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
----------------------------------

This section describes how we collect, use, sell, share, and retain personal information of California residents when we act as a “business” as defined under California privacy laws. For purposes of this section, Personal Data means “personal information” as defined under California privacy laws but does not include information exempted from the scope of such laws. Additionally, California law defines “sale” as disclosing a California resident’s personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Where such disclosure is for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, it qualifies as “sharing” under California law.

In some cases, we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

**8.1 Personal Data We Collect, Use, and Share.** The categories of Personal Data, including sensitive Personal Data, we may collect or have collected about you in the 12 months preceding the last update date of this Privacy Policy, and the categories of sources from which we collect such personal information is set forth in the section above titled “PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT.”

To opt-out of the sale/sharing of your personal information, please submit your request through the “[Your Privacy Choices](https://platform.fullcontact.com/your-privacy-choices)” Portal or review the “YOUR RIGHTS” section above.
