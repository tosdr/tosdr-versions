2. How Scotia Protects You

How Scotiabank protects you
===========================

Explore the steps we take to protect your finances and your information from scams. Learn how we can help you with cybersecurity and fraud prevention.

 

**Digital Banking Security Guarantee**


------------------------------------------

At Scotiabank, we're committed to keeping your accounts and financial information safe and secure. In the unlikely event that you suffer direct financial losses due to unauthorized activity¹ in your accounts² we’ll fully reimburse you, provided you’ve met all of your security responsibilities as outlined in the terms of our customer agreements³.

 

Report an incident

Our digital banking security commitment to you A shared responsibility

### **Our commitment to you**

As part of our commitment to keeping your information safe and secure, we’ve put the following security measures in place:

* Enforcing the use of strong encryption within web browsers (256-bit in updated browsers, 128-bit minimum) to prevent others from being able to read or tamper with your account activity.  Similarly, mobile transactions are processed behind our firewalls, strong encryption is used throughout (256-bit in updated devices, 128-bit minimum), and your identity is verified through multiple factors.

* Maintaining equipment such as firewalls and intrusion protection systems designed to help prevent and detect unauthorized access to internal systems and maintain the safety of your information.

**Security enhancements implemented to protect you:**

**● Remove saved ScotiaCard:** You can easily remove or unsave your ScotiaCard by selecting “Manage username or Cards” from the drop-down menu and selecting the trash can icon to the right of your ScotiaCard number. 

**● Timeouts:** If you're away from online banking for more than 10 minutes, your session will be interrupted. You then need to sign back in with your password. A timeout extension option is available for Scotia iTRADE customers.

● **Time stamp:**   
As an extra level of security protection, we display the date and time of your last online visit whenever you log in to online banking. 

● **Scotia Fraud Alerts:**  
We’ll alert you of any unusual account activity, so you don’t have to worry about fraudulent purchases on your ScotiaCard Visa debit card and Scotiabank Visa credit card.

**● Masked numbers:**   

Masking partially replaces the numbers in your account with asterisks, so when others look at it on your screen and on printouts, they can’t see the full number.   

**● Brokerage trading access code:** To add an extra layer of security to your Scotia iTRADE session, you can set up a secondary password for any brokerage transaction.  

**● Mobile app:** Our mobile services are provisioned by firewall-protected servers or Apple's App Store and Android Google Play. Your app will be automatically updated to the latest version when updates are made. If your device or Operating System doesn’t support the latest app updates, you’ll receive a notification within the app asking you to upgrade. We’ll never send you a text message asking you to download the latest version of the app or to download a promotional app by selecting an enclosed link. 

**Note:** There are some applications on the Scotiabank website that you can complete without signing into online banking. The minimum requirement for these applications is a supported 128-bit browser. 

Find out more details regarding supported browsers [here](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/security/protecting-yourself-your-family/internet-browser-security.html "suppported browsers here").

### **A shared responsibility**

To ensure you’re protected under the Digital Banking Security Guarantee from direct financial losses due to Unauthorized Activity¹ and protected against identity theft, it is your responsibility to follow the terms of our customer agreements³.

Here are some cybersecurity tips to help keep you stay safe from scams and identify theft when conducting your digital banking.  You can also visit the [Safe Computing Practices](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/security/protecting-yourself-your-family/safe-computing-practices.html) page to learn more about how to protect your sensitive information and privacy.

### 

Do

* Carefully select your online banking password and access code and ensure that they’re different from one another. For more information, see the following [guide](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/security/protecting-yourself-your-family/passwords-pins.html).      
* Keep your ScotiaCard number, online banking password, access code, and ScotiaCard security code number (last three italicized numbers printed on the back of your ScotiaCard) confidential.     
* If you’ve misplaced your personal Scotiabank Visa or American Express card, temporarily [lock your card](https://cdb-ux-mobile-banking-search-u.scointnet.net/article/what-does-it-mean-to-lock-a-card) using the mobile banking app.  
      
    
* Notify us immediately in the event of loss, theft, misuse, or compromise of your ScotiaCard or ScotiaCard number, online banking password, access code, or online banking session or to report fraud. You can contact us at [1-866-625-0561](tel:1-866-625-0561).      
* Review your statements and report any errors in a timely manner. Please see the applicable account agreement, statement, or trade confirmation for further details.   
      
    
* Fully assist us in any investigation into improper or unauthorized access to your accounts, including complying with any instructions we may provide.

Visit the [InfoAlerts](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal/bank-your-way/digital-banking-guide/banking-basics/infoalerts.html) page for more information.   
* Set up remote lookup and wipe-up services. There are GPS utilities for most smartphones that will let you lock your phone at a distance, locate it, wipe its contents, and even post messages on its screen so finders can easily return it to you.   
         
* Make sure you know and trust the creator of an app. Our mobile services are provisioned by firewall-protected servers or Apple's App Store and Android’s Google Play. We’ll never send you a text message asking you to download the latest version of the app or download a promotional app by selecting an enclosed link. If you ever find an app impersonating an official Scotiabank-related app, forward the email to [phishing@scotiabank.com](mailto:phishing@scotiabank.com). Please include the app name, app store name, and link to the app in your email. 

### 

Don't

* Select a password or access code that’s the same as (or similar to) an obvious number combination, such as your date of birth, bank account number, ABM PIN, or telephone number.   
         
* Write down your ScotiaCard number, online banking password, or ScotiaCard security code number, and don't share them with anyone, including family members, friends, employees, and bookkeepers.  
      
    
* Respond to pop-ups, emails, or other electronic requests that ask you to reveal personal information about yourself or your Scotiabank accounts. Scotiabank will not call you, send you emails or text messages, or present you with unexpected web pages asking you to validate or restore your confidential information such as your password, PIN, access code, credit card, account numbers, or account access.  
      
    
*  Download mobile banking apps from any site other than the device’s operating system app store.

    What we do to prevent fraud 
    
    At Scotiabank, we’ve introduced numerous safety features to keep you and your information secure at all of our automated banking machines (ABMs). 
    
    ##### 
    
    These features include:
    
    * A physical cover on all ABM PIN pads: This feature provides enhanced privacy when you input your PIN at the ABM
        
    * ABM vestibule design: A border around all ABMs acts as a barrier to prevent anyone from seeing your ABM banking activity
        
    * Camera coverage: All ABMs in our Scotiabank branch vestibules have camera coverage to help prevent theft and fraud
        
    
    * Built-in privacy screen in the ABM monitor: All ABMs feature a privacy screen that ensures everything is clear and legible only to the customer standing directly in front of the ABM 
        
    * Optional Express Cash setting: You can save your favourite withdrawal amount to reduce the amount of time it takes to do your ABM banking
        
    * Optional hide/show balance screen: You have the option to hide your balance on the screen if you don’t feel secure having it displayed
        
    * Optional email receipt: You can have your ABM transaction receipt emailed to you rather than printing it at the ABM site
        
    * Card before cash: To ensure that you never forget your ScotiaCard at an ABM, your card will always come out before your cash withdrawal 
        
    
    * Optional card tap: To prevent you from forgetting your card, you have the option to tap rather than insert it
        
    * Enhanced security to protect your ScotiaCard: Our ABMs are designed to detect if a fraudster is inserting a fake or spoofed debit card

    Our processes include:
    
    ##### 
    
    Identification
    
    In order to ensure the identity of our customers and prevent fraud, we verify each customer’s identity in accordance to the standards set out in anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism legislation, and its associated regulations.
    
    ##### 
    
    Multifactor authentication
    
    * Biometric sign-in: We offer support for fingerprint and face recognition, depending on the hardware and OS of your device
        
    * Hardware- and software-based one-time password tokens: As part of our multifactor authentication process, we generate a unique password token to ensure the customer’s identity from multiple devices
        
    * Security questions: We include security questions and answers that you create
        
    * 2-step verification (2SV): Sometimes referred to as 2-factor authentication (2FA), 2SV replaces existing ScotiaVerify questions, providing an additional layer of security in which customers provide 2 different authentication factors to verify themselves when accessing a specific mobile app 
        
    
    ##### 
    
    Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
    
    * The Scotiabank Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system interacts with a caller to gather information and can automatically route to self-service features or to a contact centre agent
    
    #####

    * Once you set up Scotia InfoAlerts, you’ll be able to receive an email, app notification, or both when important activity happens on your account.
