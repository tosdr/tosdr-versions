We want to keep our site safe for all users.  We have rules prohibiting illegal content and activity and content which is in breach of the Ko-fi Content Guidelines (see the sections titled “Acceptable Use For Creators” and “Supporter Specific Terms”).  If you spot any illegal content or activity (**Illegal Content**) on our site, or content which is in breach of the Ko-fi Content Guidelines (**Prohibited Content**) please report it to Ko-fi, whether you are a Creator, Supporter or any other user of our site.  

> **In a Nutshell**  
> Please help us keep Ko-fi a safe place.

‍

### **How To Report Content**

We have published [instructions](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/12586813054749-How-do-I-report-a-page) on our site which explain how you can report specific items of content which you think may be Illegal Content or Prohibited Content.  You will need to include the following information so that we can review the content and take the appropriate action:

* an explanation of why you consider the content to be Illegal Content or Prohibited Content – please give enough information so that we can understand your reasons;
* the page or pages which contain the content, and enough information so that we can tell which item you are referring to on the relevant page or pages; and
* your name and email address – we are required by law to ask for this information to avoid abuse of the reporting mechanisms, however, you do not have to provide this information.  Please do provide this information if it is important to help us understand that the content is illegal.  But please do not provide it where it would put you at risk.

We will also ask you to confirm that your report is accurate.  This is to avoid abuse of the reporting mechanism.  If we discover that a user is repeatedly submitting unfounded complaints about Illegal Content or Prohibited Content, we may take appropriate action.  This may include suspending the user’s access to the site.

We will investigate all reports of Illegal Content and Prohibited Content, but we will prioritise investigating reports of the following types of Illegal Content (**Priority Illegal Content**):

* Terrorism content;
* Child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content; and
* Content which constitutes any of the following: harassment, stalking or abuse; hate offences; fraud; financial services violations; extreme pornography; unlawful supply of or guidance on taking drugs/psychoactive substances; firearms and other weapons; unlawful immigration and human trafficking; sharing private images/sextortion; sexual exploitation of adults; foreign interference; threats to kill; proceeds of crime; controlling or coercive behaviour).

> **In a Nutshell**  
> If you submit a report to us about Illegal or Prohibited content, we will investigate it.  We will investigate certain types of illegal content as a priority.

‍

### **We Also Check for Priority Illegal Content**

As well as the reporting process, we also have systems and processes in place to check for Priority Illegal Content.  These may include automatic reviewing systems for images and text and may include human review.  We keep our systems and processes under review, to take account of emerging technologies.

> **In a Nutshell**  
> We also use pro-active content checks for certain types of illegal content.

‍

### **What We Do If We Become Aware Of Illegal Content**

We have a legal duty to act if we become aware of any Illegal Content on our site, whether that is from a user report or from our own systems and processes.

If we become aware of Illegal Content we will take whatever actions we consider are necessary and/or appropriate, which may include:

* removing or disabling access to the Illegal Content; and/or
* suspending or terminating a user’s account or restricting their access to our site if we discover that a user is repeatedly submitting Illegal Content.

Where we take an action, we will write to the person who provided the Illegal Content to explain our decision.  We will provide details to the user of how they can challenge our decision.   Where we made the decision in response to a report, we will not reveal the identity of the reporter unless doing so is necessary to explain why the content was removed, for example where a rights holder reports a user infringing their intellectual property rights.

Where we have electronic contact details for the user who provided the report (if relevant), we will also write to them to explain our decision.  We will provide details to the user of how they can challenge our decision.

> **In a Nutshell**  
> We will decide what to do about the content and we will let the relevant users know our decision.
