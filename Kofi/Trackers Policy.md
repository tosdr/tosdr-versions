### **7.Disclosing your information**

We are allowed to disclose your information in the following cases:

* If we want to sell the service or the company, we can disclose it to the potential buyer.
* We can disclose it to other businesses in our group.
* We can disclose it if we have a legal obligation to do so, or in order to protect other people's property, safety or rights.
* If a payment provider such as PayPal or Stripe requests access to it.
* We can exchange information with others to protect against fraud or credit risks.

We may contract with third parties to supply services to you on our behalf. These may include payment processing, search engine facilities, advertising and marketing. In some cases, the third parties may require access to some or all of your data.

Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the obligations of the third party under GDPR and the law.  

**Disclosing supporter information to creators**

We will disclose the email address and any transaction information entered on Ko-fi required to facilitate direct communication between the Creator and Supporter, the fulfilment of transactions or calculation of tax liabilities.

Creators are responsible for how they use the data collected on Ko-fi. By following, supporting, subscribing or buying from a Creator on Ko-fi you are directing us to share your information in this way. If you do not wish for information to be disclosed to a creator please do not enter that information on Ko-fi.

Creators may contact you outside of Ko-fi and you agree to contact them directly should you wish to withdraw your consent to contact you. It will be wholly the responsibility of the creator, not Ko-fi to use your data in accordance with applicable laws.  

**Creators Using supporter or follower information**

We expect Creators to respect the privacy of the followers and supporters whose information you have received. As described in Ko-fi [Terms and Conditions](https://more.ko-fi.com/terms), you have a limited license to use that information only for Ko-fi related communications and transactions. Ko-fi has not granted a license to you to use the information for unauthorised transactions or sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of any applicable laws, including any consent requirements of the jurisdiction of the recipient.

You should only add a Supporter to your email or physical mailing list or otherwise use or store a Supporter’s personal information in accordance with applicable laws, including any consent requirements that apply in that member's jurisdiction.

> **In a Nutshell**  
> Reputable third-party suppliers and partners are used to process personal data. We may transfer your personal data to these suppliers. We may also provide Creators with Supporter email addresses and transaction information in order to communicate or fulfil transactions.
