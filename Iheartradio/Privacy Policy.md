1\. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT
-------------------------------

We (and the vendors we hire to perform business functions on our behalf) and other parties who have integrated their technologies into our Platforms and services may collect, receive, and develop several categories of personal information about you depending on the nature of your interactions with us: 

Identifiers: We may collect your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mobile phone number, mailing address, date of birth, social media account handles or usernames, and iHeartMedia account usernames and passwords. You may create a personal iHeartRadio Code by enabling this feature through the settings in the Apps; the iHeartRadio Code is connected to a unique identifier that ties back to your iHeartRadio account and the information associated with your account. We may collect your digital signature in certain circumstances.  

Demographic and Protected Classification Information: We may collect your zip code, age, gender, language preferences, marital status, and political affiliation.

Purchase and Preference Information: We may collect information about the artists, stations, podcasts, playlists, and genres you are interested in; content you purchase, access, or download; records of your transactions and subscription purchases; and records of contests you enter. 

Internet Browser, Usage, and Device Information: We use tracking tools like cookies and pixels to automatically collect information about your interactions with our Platforms, such as your IP address and other unique identifiers for the computer, mobile device, tablet or other device you use to connect (“Device”), including the hardware model and mobile network information. We collect information about your use of the Platforms, including your browser type; operating system; activations; listening times; what areas of the Platforms you access and for how long; search terms you enter; how long you stay on a page; which hyperlinks and content or advertisements you click on; which songs, playlists, audiovisual content and other iHeartMedia users you interact with; and the page served and preceding page views. If you use our Apps, we may also look at how often you use the Apps and where you downloaded it. We may collect information about your views, clicks, and interactions with our digital content and advertisements (both on and off the Platforms), as well as our promotional emails. If you create an account using your credentials from a third-party social media site, we will have access to certain personal information from that site, as described further below. 

Location Information: If you choose to turn on your Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality when you use the Apps, subject to your consent, we will collect general location information about your Device when you access or use the Platforms (but not your precise geolocation within the ranges defined by applicable laws unless we obtain a separate consent from you).     

Voice Data: If you enable voice control features for one of our products on your device, we will collect audio recordings and transcripts of what you say when you interact with one of our voice features. For example, you may be able to use your voice to interact with select audio advertisements or to search, select, and listen to music. For more information, see our [**Voice Data FAQ.**](https://help.iheart.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055990651-Voice)

Professional Information: If you interact with us on behalf of business customers, vendors, or other companies, in addition to other personal information described in this notice, we may also collect items like your job title, office location, compensation or payments, and engagement history with us.

Sensitive Personal Information: We may collect your social security number if you are the winner of a promotion or contest. We will collect your payment card details when you make a purchase. In addition to the above, if you interact with us on behalf of business customers, vendors, or other companies, we may also collect your driver’s license number, background check information, and social security number if relevant to our relationship with you. 

Inferences: Using the other pieces of personal information collected about you, we draw inferences about you, reflecting what we believe to be your interests, characteristics, predispositions, and attitudes.

3\. WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES

We collect personal information when you create an iHeartRadio Code. If you are a business contact, we also collect personal information directly from you when we communicate with you, onboard you, or provide/receive products or services to/from you. 

Automatically from your devices: We, as well as advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of tracking tools and technologies that automatically or passively collect personal information like browser/usage/device information and location information any time you visit or interact with the Platforms, our emails, and our advertising and content on other websites and platforms.

From our business partners and data providers: We receive personal information about you from our business partners, including those businesses with whom we offer joint or co-branded promotions, or who advertise on the Platforms.

In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a social media application or website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections“ web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other website or interactive service. 

From other users: Other users may decide to provide us with your personal information (such as Identifiers) so that we may invite you to join iHeartMedia or so that we may facilitate communication between users of the Platforms.

We may also aggregate your information with other consumers’ information to understand preferences and trends within your peer group over time. 

4\. WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO OTHERS

Likewise, if you log into a third-party application with your iHeartMedia account, that application may have access to certain information such as your iHeartMedia playlists and activity.

_To Other Users:_ _Your username and profile picture are publicly available at an unlisted URL. Your activity on the Platform (e.g., music you listen to, music you share) and playlists created or created for you are made publicly available by default and can be accessed by those who know the unlisted URL.  This URL may be displayed publicly in third-party search engine results and may appear together with other public profile information, such as your playlists, picture and username. This information is made public by default, but you can limit this as described in the “Your Choices” section below._ 

Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to the Platforms, your personal information may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and may be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to other parties. 

With SDK Partners: We may make available personal information to technology companies whose software development kits (SDKs) or application programming interfaces (APIs) are embedded into our Apps. 

For legal compliance: We may disclose personal information to other parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our [**Terms of Use**](https://www.iheart.com/content/terms-of-use/) or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of other parties, visitors to our Platforms, or the public. 

Other disclosures: We may disclose personal information for other reasons we may describe to you from time to time as permitted by law, such as in response to your selection to share a playlist with other users on the Platform. 

Non-personal information: We may disclose information that has been de-identified or aggregated such that it does not identify or relate to you, with other parties for any purpose. This may include aggregated user statistics about the Platforms or aggregated demographic information about our users.

Interest-Based Advertising: 

When you use the Platforms, we, our service providers, and advertising partners may place cookies and similar tracking technologies on your computer or Device in order to collect information about your online web-browsing activities over time and across different websites and online services or mobile applications, in order to serve you ads or other content personalized to your interests.

In order to personalize these ads or content, we or our advertising partners or service providers may connect and/or disclose personal information about you either to data you provided to us or to browser/usage/device information and location information collected about you. 

You can opt out of being tracked online for IBA purposes by going to [**https://optout.aboutads.info**](https://optout.aboutads.info/) or [**https://optout.networkadvertising.org**](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/), or by disabling advertising cookies by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information” link in the footer of this webpage.

When clicked it (1) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant party website and (2) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the other parties listed for the purposes of IBA. 

Choices you make are device-specific and browser-specific. If you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and Devices, you will need to opt out of IBA from each browser on each of the computers and Devices that you use. Please note that even if you opt out of IBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; they just won't be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites. Please also note that if you opt-out of IBA, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes. 

To opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with LiveRamp, please click go to [**https://optout.liveramp.com/opt\_out**](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out).
