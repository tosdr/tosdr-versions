This website is maintained in the United States by Arista Networks, Inc. ("we" or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we, and all of our corporate subsidiaries and affiliates, use any personal information that we collect about you when you use this website (the "Site") and our cloud networking solutions and products (the "Services") or otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.

We take data privacy and the security of your personal information seriously and will only use such personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Please read the following information carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.

We provide certain cloud-based services (e.g., Arista CloudVision and CloudVision CUE) to our corporate customers. If you are an end user of services provided by our customers based on our cloud services, then we act on behalf of our customer as a data processor and service provider. This means that our customer acts as a data controller and will provide information on how they collect and process your data using our Services. They are your contact for any questions you have about how they handle your personal information. Additionally, the policies relating to the collection and disclosure of personal information and the rights provided under certain applicable laws only relate to Arista’s direct actions as a business with you and not a service provider. For more information, please see the section below Acting as a Data Processor.

Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not understand or agree to its terms, please do not use the Site or submit your personal information to us.

#### [What categories of information do we collect about you?](#pp01)

We also collect data that you choose to provide us, for example, by registering for an account with us, submitting product and service inquiries, purchasing products, partnership requests, and the like, or by otherwise communicating with us. The categories and specific types of personal information that Arista has collected in the past 12 months about you may include:

* **contact information/identifiers,** including your name, personal or business address, phone number, and/or email address;
* **financial information,** including credit or debit card number (if you’re purchasing directly through our website);
* **sensitive personal information,** including username and password;
* **device information and other unique identifiers,** including device identifier, internet protocol (IP) address, or similar unique identifiers; and
* **internet or other network activity,** including browsing or search history, and information regarding your interactions with our websites, mobile applications, emails, or advertisements.

#### [Sources of Personal Information](#pp02)

We collect your personal information in the following ways, pursuant to applicable law:

* **Directly From You,** when you use our Services, register for an account, contact us, respond to a survey, and sign up to receive emails and/or postal mailings.
* **Through Our Use of Cookies and Other Automatic Data Collection Technologies,** when you visit our websites, open or click on emails we send you, or interact with our advertisements. We or third parties with whom we work automatically collect certain information using technologies such as cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, pixels, internet tags, web server logs, and other data collection tools. For more information, please see the "[Cookie Policy](https://www.arista.com/privacy-policy/cookie-policy)" below.

#### [How will we use the Personal Information that we collect?](#pp03)

We use your personal information (including in certain instances your sensitive personal information) for the following business and commercial purposes ("Processing Purposes") associated with our general business operations. We do the following with your personal information:

* use your email address and other contact information to communicate with you, to provide you with product, service, or other information you have requested of us and to carry out any obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us or your company and us, including providing warranty and technical support for our products and services;

* for marketing and promotional purposes to show you advertisements for products and/or services tailored to your interests on social media and other websites;
* to manage our business operations and exercise our rights under any agreement that you or your company has with us;
* to conduct research and analytics related to our Sites and Services, including combining any or all of the information that we collect or obtain;
* to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, to establish or exercise our rights, and to defend against a legal claim; and
* to detect, investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, including fraudulent transactions, attempts to manipulate or violate our policies, procedures, and terms and conditions, security incidents, and harm to the rights, property, or safety of Arista and our users, customers, employees, or others.

##### **Legal Basis of Processing**

Where a legal basis for processing is required (e.g., the European Union and the United Kingdom), we process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy based on the following legal grounds:

* **With Your Consent:** In certain instances, we ask for your consent to process your personal information for specific purposes. Provision of your consent is voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
* **When Pursuing Legitimate Interests:** We process your personal information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties, while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy, and as further described in this Privacy Policy.
* **To Perform a Contract With You:** We will process your personal information when processing of your personal information is necessary for the evaluation, execution or performance of a contract with you.
* **When We Have Legal Obligations:** We will process your personal information when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we are responding to a legal process or an enforceable government request, including law enforcement.

In some cases, the provision of personal information may be required by a statutory or contractual obligation.

#### [To whom do we disclose your Personal Information?](#pp04)

We may disclose or transfer the personal information listed above to the parties and in the manner described below.

**Within Arista and Service Providers:** We transfer some of your personal information among our global subsidiaries and to our trusted service providers for their assistance in providing the services described, as required by contractual obligations, legal obligations, and/or based on other legitimate interests or your consent to such transfer. Our Trusted Service Providers (also sometimes referred to as [subprocessors](https://www.arista.com/sub-processor)) include communications services providers (such as email), cloud hosting providers, and marketing/sales contact management providers. Such parties are expected to apply at least the same level of protection as outlined in this Privacy Policy, and our transfer to them will be in compliance with relevant data privacy laws and relevant data authority approved data transfer mechanisms. A full list of our Trusted Service Providers is available [here](https://www.arista.com/sub-processor) and will be updated prior to engaging a new Trusted Service Provider.

Our trusted service providers are under strict obligations to safeguard your data and only process it for our use; the data cannot be used by any other party or for any other purpose. For example, we do not allow the information that you provide to be used to market any third-party products or services to you.

**Public Comments and Content:** Over time, the Site may enable users to communicate in a variety of ways, such as posting of comments, messaging features, and the like. Any personal information that you voluntarily choose to submit through such a feature will be available to other users who have access to that content. Once you make your personal information available to others in any of these ways, it may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.

**Government Entities, Regulators and Other Third Parties:** We may disclose personal information where a government, regulatory body, or the law requires us to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose personal information for legal reasons, as we believe to be necessary or appropriate to: (a) satisfy any applicable law, legal process, or proper governmental request; (b) enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you or your company, including investigating any violations or asserting remedies; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (d) protect against harm (whether tangible or intangible) to the rights, property, or safety of Arista, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law; and (e) establish or exercise our rights, defend against a legal claim, and investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities or a violation of our policies. Arista further commits to challenging, as reasonable in its sole discretion, any request it deems unlawful in whole or in part.

**Business Transaction:** We may also disclose your personal information to a potential or actual buyer in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), including any due diligence related to such a transaction.

**Social Media Platforms:** Some of our websites have features such as plugins, widgets, or other tools made available by third parties that may result in information being collected or shared between us and the third party. You may have the right to opt out of our use of these technologies, as further described in this Privacy Policy.

**De-identified or Aggregated Information:** Finally, we may aggregate and anonymize information you provide to us in such a way as to ensure it will no longer be identifiable to you.

You may exercise any of your rights in this section without discrimination by us.

#### [California Residents](#pp07)

If you are a California resident and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") applies to our processing of your personal information, we provide this additional information so you can understand and exercise your rights under the CCPA.

We use and disclose your personal information for the Processing Purposes set out in the "How Will We Use The Personal Information That We Collect?" and the "To Whom Do We Disclose Your Personal Information?" sections above.

When the CCPA applies, California residents will have the following rights:

##### **General Rights:**

* Right to access personal information, right to data portability, right to deletion/erasure of personal information, and right to correction/rectification of inaccurate personal information, as described in the section above entitled "Your Privacy Rights".

##### **Do not Sell or Share my Personal Information:**

* Right to prohibit/opt out of the "sale" or "share" of personal information: You have the right to prohibit/opt out of the "sale" or "share" of personal information. However, Arista does not "Sell" or "share" your personal data.

##### **Sensitive Personal Information:**

* Right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of Sensitive Personal Information. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those which cannot be limited under California law.

We do not discriminate against California residents who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Policy. However, Arista may require use of your personal information to provide access to the Services. Therefore, when you exercise your deletion right, in particular, you may lose access to certain aspects of the Services that require your personal information.

If you would like to exercise any of your rights as described in this policy, please submit this [Privacy Rights Web form](https://www.arista.com/privacy-rights) or email us at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it., and we will address your request. You may also contact us at 1-866-868-0825. You may exercise any of your rights in this section without discrimination by us.

After you make your request, we will use the information we have about you to verify your identity (and if applicable, your authorized agent’s identity). Our verification process may include a request for additional information to confirm your identity or your authorized agent’s identity (such as your name, email address, and date of birth) or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf. If our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.

If you designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must attach a copy of the following information to the request:

1. A completed Authorized Agent Designation Form (or equivalent form) indicating that you have authorization to act on the individual’s behalf.
2. If you are a business, proof that you are registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California.

If you are a current or former California Arista employee, please reference our Arista Employee Policy.

If you are a California applicant, please reference our Arista [Applicant Policy](https://www.arista.com/privacy-policy/applicant-policy).

#### [Data from Minors](#pp08)

Our Sites and Services do not target and are not intended to attract children or minors under the age of 16. Arista does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or minors under the age of 16 or send them requests for personal information. If you believe we have collected personal information from a person under 16 years old without the consent of their parent or legal guardian, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated below and providing sufficient information so we can act appropriately.

#### [Do Not Track](#pp09)

Arista does not track its customers over time or across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

#### [Acting as a Data Processor](#pp10)

With respect to some of our cloud-based product and service offerings, Arista acts merely as a data processor of our corporate customers’ data, which may include your personal information as an end user of services provided by our customers. For example, if we provide a coffee shop with an Arista CloudVision CUE solution and they use it to provide guest Wi-Fi access to you as a patron, we are merely a data processor for the coffee shop, and the coffee shop is the data controller. In that situation, you - as a patron - should work directly with the coffee shop to understand how they use your data. While we still maintain this data securely and in accordance with the principles of this policy, there are a few aspects of this policy that apply specifically to this situation. They are:

* Our customers provide the same or similar types of data about themselves and about you as we list above, but the extent of collected data is dependent on our customers’ settings and the information that you choose to share with our customers. While you should contact the relevant customer directly, information stored about you additionally may include device identifiers (e.g., MAC or IP addresses) for devices visible to or connected to the Services, device activity, time, location and configuration data, applications used, and/or websites accessed;
* Arista only processes this data on the instructions of our customers, the data controllers;
* In this capacity, Arista provides data storage and system management for our customers’ systems;
* Arista may use anonymized or pseudo-anonymized aspects of this customer data to analyze and improve Arista’s products and Services;
* Because our customers provide the data and we process it only on their instructions, we have given our customers the tools to respond to any data inquiries, such as those relating to access, processing restrictions, deletion, and the like; we therefore will direct, when necessary, such inquiries to our customers and work with them to respond if they need our assistance. Please direct any inquiries regarding exercising your rights to your personal information to the company whose services you are directly using; and
* Our customers will determine how long the personal information which you have provided to them is retained; please contact them in the first instance with any questions.

#### [Retention of your Personal Information](#pp11)

We retain information about you and your use of our Services for as long as is needed to fulfill our legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The specific periods for which we keep information about you vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it, and whether the personal information is de-identified. We also consider the minimum necessary retention period prescribed by applicable laws, recommended by industry standards, and stated in contracts and other legal obligations.

#### [Security](#pp12)

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

#### [Third parties and links to other websites and services](#pp13)

As noted above, our Sites and Services may contain links to websites, content, or services owned or operated by third parties. Please note, we have no control over the privacy practices of websites or services that we do not own. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party website or application for details about what information is collected and how it is used and/or disclosed.

#### [Transfers of information to other countries](#pp14)

As we are a company with a global presence and affiliates around the world, your personal information will generally be transferred to the United States and various other locations around the world both inside and outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), as needed to carry out the purposes described above, based on appropriate transfer mechanisms, including Standard Contractual Clauses and within the bounds set forth herein.

##### **Contact Us**

Any questions or concerns regarding the handling of Personal Information by Arista, or related to revocation of consent to collect, process, transfer, or disclose your Personal Information should be directed by email to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.. Additionally, you can contact us toll free at 1-866-868-0825, and someone will address your inquiry.
