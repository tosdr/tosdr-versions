PillPack LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively “Amazon Pharmacy”) are committed to maintaining your privacy and we take our responsibility for safeguarding your Protected Health Information very seriously. Amazon Pharmacy is required by the HIPAA to provide you with this Notice to help you understand how we may use or share Protected Health Information about you that we obtain to provide services to you. “Protected Health Information” is the information we receive to provide services to you that identifies you or could be used to identify you and relates to your past, present, or future physical or mental health, treatment, or your payment for treatment. Protected Health Information includes your medication history, medical conditions, health insurance information, and other information we use to provide you your prescriptions. In addition to HIPAA, we comply with applicable state and federal laws that provide additional protections for your health information.

If you have any questions about this Notice, please contact the Amazon Pharmacy Privacy Office at the address listed below.

How we may use and disclose your Protected Health Information
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following categories describe the typical ways that we may use and disclose your Protected Health Information without your written authorization:

* For Treatment. Protected Health Information obtained by Amazon Pharmacy will be used in order to dispense your prescription medications and provide the treatment and services you receive. We may disclose Protected Health Information about you to doctors, nurses, or other health care providers who are involved in taking care of you. We may also seek Protected Health Information about you from other health care providers and health information networks. For example, in order to fill your prescription, we may request your medical records from your doctor or disclose Protected Health Information to your doctor.
* For Payment. We may use or disclose your Protected Health Information in order to bill and collect payment for products or services we provided to you. For example, we may contact your insurance company, health plan, or another third-party to obtain payment for your prescriptions.
* For Health Care Operations. We may use and disclose your Protected Health Information for our day-to-day health care operations. For example, we may use your Protected Health Information to monitor the performance of the staff and pharmacists providing treatment and services to our customers or to improve the quality and the effectiveness of the health care services we provide.

We may also use and disclose your Protected Health Information without your written authorization as follows:

* Business Associates. We may contract with third parties to perform certain services for us, such as accounting services, consulting services, or information technology services. In some cases, these third-party service providers, called Business Associates, may need to access your Protected Health Information to perform services for us. They are required by law and contract to protect your Protected Health Information.
* Disclosures to Parents or Legal Guardians. We may release a minor's Protected Health Information to their parents or legal guardians consistent with applicable laws. For example, parents may order prescriptions on behalf of a minor child and access the child’s prescription history.
* As Required By Law. We will disclose your Protected Health Information when required to do so by applicable law.
* To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety. We may use and disclose your Protected Health Information to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person.
* Organ and Tissue Donation. Consistent with applicable law, we may disclose your Protected Health Information to organizations engaged in the procurement, banking, or transplantation of organs for the purpose of tissue donation and transplant.
* Military and Veterans. If you are a member or veteran of the armed forces, we may disclose Protected Health Information about you as required by military authorities.
* Research. We may use your Protected Health Information to conduct research or disclose it to researchers as authorized by applicable law. For example, we may use or disclose your Protected Health Information as part of a research study when the research has been approved by an authorized review body that establishes processes to ensure the privacy of your information.
* Workers’ Compensation. We may disclose Protected Health Information about you for workers’ compensation or similar programs that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.
* Public Health Activities. Applicable laws may require or permit Amazon Pharmacy to disclose certain Protected Health Information, for reasons such as:
    * Preventing disease or telling people when they may have been exposed to or may be at risk of contracting a disease;
    * Reporting reactions to medications, problems with products, or product recalls;
    * Reporting information to your employer if we provide health care services to you at the request of your employer;
    * Providing proof of immunization to your school if you are a student or prospective student of the school; and
    * Notifying a government authority if we reasonably believe you are a victim of abuse or neglect. We will only disclose this type of information to the extent required by law, if you agree to the disclosure, or if we believe it is necessary to prevent serious harm to you or someone else.
* Health Oversight Activities. We may disclose Protected Health Information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities may include audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These activities help the government monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.
* Judicial and Administrative Proceedings. We may disclose your Protected Health Information pursuant to a court or administrative order, subpoena, discovery demand, or other lawful process. If permitted to do so, we will attempt to provide you notice prior to disclosing your PHI unless such notice has been provided by another party to the dispute.
* Law Enforcement. We may disclose your Protected Health Information to law enforcement as required by law or pursuant to a court order, subpoena, warrant, or similar process. We will attempt to provide you with notice prior to disclosing your PHI to law enforcement if we are permitted to do so.
* Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors. We may disclose Protected Health Information to a coroner or medical examiner. This may be necessary to identify a deceased person or determine the cause of death. We may also disclose Protected Health Information to funeral directors as necessary to carry out their duties.
* Correctional Institution. If you are or become an inmate of a correctional institution, we may disclose to the institution or its agents Protected Health Information necessary for your health and the health and safety of others.
* Specialized Government Functions. We may disclose your Protected Health Information to units of the government with special functions, such as the U.S. Secret Service for the protection of the President, or the U.S. Department of State to make medical suitability determinations about individuals who are members of the foreign service.

Choices you have about certain uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information

For certain Protected Health Information, you can tell us your choices about what we share. If you have a clear preference for how we share your information in the situations described below, please contact our Privacy Office.

* Sharing Protected Health Information with family, close friends, caregiver, or others involved in your care or payment for your care
* Sharing Protected Health Information in a disaster relief situation

Unless you object to such sharing, we may disclose your Protected Health Information to a family member or a close friend, or any other person you have identified that is directly relevant to the person's involvement in your care or paying for your care. If you are unavailable prior to a disclosure or otherwise not able to tell us your preference, we may exercise our professional judgment to determine whether sharing your information with one or more of these individuals is in your best interest.

Any other uses and disclosures of Protected Health Information that are not mentioned above will be made only with your written authorization, including the use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes (to the extent we have any), use or disclosure of Protected Health Information for marketing, and for the sale of Protected Health Information (except in limited circumstances where applicable law allows such uses or disclosure without your authorization).

If you provide us authorization to use or disclose your Protected Health Information, you may revoke that authorization in writing at any time by sending a revocation request to the address listed at the end of this Notice.
