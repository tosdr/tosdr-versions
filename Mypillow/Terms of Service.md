In the event that an arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous, you must reimburse My Pillow for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by My Pillow on your behalf that you would have otherwise been obligated to pay in accordance with the rules of the AAA. For claims over $25,000 (US Dollars), you will be responsible for the Filing Fees.

UNLESS YOU AND MY PILLOW AGREE OTHERWISE, IN THE EVENT THAT IT IS DETERMINED OR THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS PROVIDE THAT A CLAIM SHOULD NOT PROCEED THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A CLAIM OR DISPUTE APPROPRIATELY LODGED IN ANY SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) SHALL BE RESOLVED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA, AND YOU SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THAT COURT. IF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (INCLUDING DIVERSITY JURISDICTION) DOES NOT EXIST IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA FOR ANY SUCH CLAIM, THEN THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM AND VENUE FOR ANY SUCH ACTION SHALL BE THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA LOCATED IN HENNEPIN COUNTY, AND YOU SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THAT COURT. YOU AND MY PILLOW BOTH WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, UNLESS SUCH WAIVER IS UNENFORCEABLE.

THE MAKING OF CLAIMS OR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (1) ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THE SITE, THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS FROM MY PILLOW AND/OR THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY IN THE FORUM DESIGNATED IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION; AND, (2) EXCEPT FOR NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS AND WHERE OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, JUDGMENTS, AND AWARDS WILL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL THIRD-PARTY, OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS INCURRED (IF ANY), BUT IN NO EVENT WILL ATTORNEYS’ FEES BE AWARDED OR RECOVERABLE.

Dispute Resolution  

1. General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and MyPillow in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and MyPillow agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these messaging terms and conditions ("Messaging Terms") or your receipt of text messages from MyPillow or its service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Messaging Terms, or your receipt of text messages from MyPillow or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE MESSAGING TERMS, YOU AND MyPillow ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THESE MESSAGING TERMS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.
2. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, nothing in these Messaging Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or MyPillow to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
3. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and MyPillow will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Messaging Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting MyPillow. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
4. Notice; Process. If you or MyPillow intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). MyPillow address for Notice is: 1550 Audubon Rd, Chaska, Minnesota 55318, Attn: Chief Executive Officer. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and MyPillow will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and MyPillow do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or MyPillow may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or MyPillow must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. (e) Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Messaging Terms, MyPillow will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse MyPillow for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and MyPillow agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or MyPillow made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
5. No Class Actions. YOU AND MyPillow AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and MyPillow agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
6. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Messaging Terms, if MyPillow makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to MyPillow address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to MyPillow address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and MyPillow.
7. Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations of subsection (f) above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of these Messaging Terms is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of these Messaging Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
