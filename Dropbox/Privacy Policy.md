1\. How long does Dropbox keep my files after I delete my account?

[Find more information on how long we keep e-signed documents.](https://faq.hellosign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061564331-How-to-delete-a-document-for-everyone)

2\. What are Dropbox’s lawful bases for processing my data?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Dropbox processes your data (1) to provide the Dropbox Services to you pursuant to our contract with you; (2) in furtherance of its legitimate interests in operating our Services and business; and (3) with your consent. In some cases, Dropbox may process your data to comply with applicable law, legal process, or regulation; protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; or to carry out a task in the public interest.

Examples of Dropbox processing your data to provide you with the Dropbox Services include:

* Providing, updating, maintaining, and protecting our Services and business. For example, we host your files, back them up, and share them when you ask us to. We also analyze how you use the Services to help you prioritize your content and stay on top of your most important work.
* Troubleshooting issues you may encounter with the Dropbox Services. If you contact us with questions or concerns about the Services, we may use your personal information to respond.
* Billing, account management, and administrative purposes. If you sign up for a trial or purchase a paid Dropbox plan, we may collect and process payment information, including your name, credit or debit card information, billing address, and details of your transaction history.
* Sending you emails and other communications. We may contact you about important changes to our Services and Service-related notices. These communications are considered part of the Dropbox Services and you may not opt out of them.

Examples of Dropbox processing your data in furtherance of its legitimate interests in operating our Services and business include:

* Understanding how you use our Services and improving them.
* Promoting Dropbox Services that are most relevant to your interests.
* Investigating and preventing security issues and abuse of the Dropbox Services or Dropbox users.
* For the DocSend portion of the Dropbox Services, conducting analytics and reporting on industry trends on content usage and performance. 

Examples of Dropbox processing your data with your consent include:

* Sending you marketing materials about our Services. If you don't wish to receive these materials, simply click the Unsubscribe link in any email, or update your preferences in the [Notifications](https://help.dropbox.com/view-edit/turn-off-comment-notifications) section of your Dropbox account.
* Connecting your Dropbox account with other third-party services via Dropbox APIs.
* Collecting feedback from you to improve our Services and develop new features.

3\. How does Dropbox collect and use my usage information?
----------------------------------------------------------

We collect information about how you use the Services, including actions you take in your Dropbox account, to efficiently and reliably provide the Dropbox Services. We also use such information to improve our Services and develop new features, protect Dropbox users, and, in some instances, promote the Dropbox Services. For example, to provide the Dropbox Service and help you prioritize your work, we analyze your usage activity to recommend content that you might find most relevant and important. To improve our Services, we collect information about how you interact with our Services to understand what features are most useful to you and improve them. To protect Dropbox users, we analyze things like IP addresses, login history, and email and password changes to detect and respond to abusive behavior. To promote Dropbox Services, we will, in some instances, analyze information about users’ activity and level of engagement with our Services—such as how many devices they’ve connected to their Dropbox account and how much storage space they’ve used—to identify users who may be interested in our premium services.

In certain cases where we no longer need data to be attributable to an individual, we will de-identify the data. For example, we use de-identified customer feedback to improve our products and services. Dropbox takes measures to ensure that data can't be re-associated with an individual by using a combination of methods such as anonymization, aggregation, and generalization. Dropbox does not attempt to re-identify any de-identified data.

4\. How does Dropbox use my personal information for machine learning and algorithmic analysis?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dropbox collects and processes your personal data using algorithmic analysis or machine learning technologies to provide, improve, protect, and promote the Dropbox Services:

Provide Dropbox Services. We use machine learning technology to make it easier for you to find, retrieve, organize, and prioritize Your Stuff, collaborate with those you work with most, and stay focused on your most important work. For example, we analyze your account activity and usage history to suggest content in your Dropbox account that you might find most relevant, predict and auto-correct search queries to help you find what you’re looking for, and troubleshoot issues you may be experiencing with the Dropbox Services.

Protect Dropbox Services. We use algorithmic analysis on things like your IP address, login history, and account changes (such as email address and password changes) to detect and respond to abusive behavior and content on our Services.

Improve Dropbox Services. Dropbox uses algorithmic analysis and machine learning to improve the Dropbox Services and develop new features. For instance, we analyze information about how you interact with the Services to optimize the design of our user interface, improve the way our algorithms suggest and personalize content, refine the relevance of search results to help you find what you’re looking for, and develop new ways to streamline your workflow.

Promote Dropbox Services. We will, in some instances, use algorithmic analysis to identify users’ activity and level of engagement with our Services by looking at things like how many devices they’ve connected to their Dropbox account, how much storage space they’ve used, the content of their files, and how many sharing actions they’ve taken to identify and market to users who might be interested in learning more about our premium Services.

5\. What trusted third parties does Dropbox share my personal information with?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services, Dropbox shares your personal information with trusted third parties, as well as other Dropbox Companies.

Trusted third parties are companies or individuals that Dropbox engages to provide, improve, protect, and promote Dropbox Services.
