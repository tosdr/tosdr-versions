Welcome!
--------

Thank you for choosing Whirlpool, which owns and operates brands including Whirlpool®, Maytag®, KitchenAid®, Jenn-Air®, Amana®, Gladiator®, Roper®, Estate®, Yummly®, EveryDrop®, Swash®, Inglis®, Affresh®, and Speed Queen™ (Canada only). Review these Terms carefully: this is a contract and affects your legal rights. By using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by and comply with these Terms. If at any time you do not accept these Terms, stop using the Services, delete all of your Platform accounts, and delete any Smart Appliances from your accounts.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, THIS PROVISION WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO USE JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND ABIDE BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE, AND MUST IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE ANY AND ALL USE OF, THE SERVICES.

We offer a variety of features and functions through our websites, mobile sites, mobile apps (“Apps”), and other services (collectively, our “Platform”) that we hope you love. Our Apps can interact with select appliances with Internet-enabled features (“Smart Appliances”), all of which can interact with Whirlpool’s Internet-based servers (“Cloud”) to provide you with various capabilities. The Smart Appliances, Apps, Cloud, and the capabilities they deliver are collectively referred to in these Terms as “Smart Features.” Our Smart Features along with our Platform, including but not limited to all U.S. and Canadian websites and apps owned or operated by Whirlpool or its subsidiaries, are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Services,” except where otherwise expressly noted.

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Services, including but not limited to products you purchase or interact with using the Services. In these Terms, “Whirlpool,” “us,” “our,” or “we” mean Whirlpool Corporation, including Whirlpool Canada LP. “You” and “your” mean you, the user of the Smart Features.

These Terms are for Services provided or distributed in the United States and Canada. For products or services that are provided or distributed in other countries, different terms may apply. Additional terms may apply depending on which of our products or services you use, or for promotions, sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, or similar programs (“Additional Terms”). If Additional Terms are inconsistent with these Terms, the Additional Terms control. You agree to use only the Services directed to your country — for example, US users should use our US websites (having a .com domain) and US apps (available in US app stores), while Canada users should use our Canadian websites (having a .ca domain) and Canadian apps (available in Canadian app stores).

If you use Smart Features enabled by the Yummly® digital recipe platform, you also agree to Yummly’s Terms of Use (**[yummly.com/terms](https://www.yummly.com/terms)**)

BY USING THESE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCE, OR OTHERWISE ARE BEING SUPERVISED BY A LEGAL GUARDIAN AND MEET ALL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. If you do not meet all of these requirements, do not access or use the Services.

Privacy and Security
--------------------

We value your trust. To learn how we collect, use, and disclose your information, please review our Privacy Notice, available on our websites and in our Apps. By using the Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure and sharing of data as described in the Privacy Notice.

Whirlpool is committed to securing the data you provide us and we take reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your personal information. However, there is always some risk of privacy or security breaches when sending data over the Internet; as such, it is possible that information you send us may be read or intercepted by others. You agree that you will not hold us liable for any damages resulting from privacy or security breaches due to your use of the Services.

Creating an Account
-------------------

To use certain Services, you may need to create an account. Your username and password are for your personal use only, and you are responsible for maintaining their confidentiality. You are responsible for keeping your account and contact information up to date. You may be held liable for all losses incurred by us or any other user of our Services due to activities that occur under your account, including any misuse by you or others. You agree to promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your user name, password, or account. You are responsible for any unauthorized access or password misuse. You may not use another person’s account without permission, act in a way that interferes with another user’s account, or solicit another user’s password. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations. We reserve the right at any time to terminate or suspend your account(s) for any or no reason, including any violation of these Terms.

Making Purchases
----------------

### Product Availability

We use reasonable efforts to fulfill orders, but cannot guarantee availability of any particular product or service and sometimes an item may not be available. In that case, we may cancel your order or contact you for follow-up. We reserve the right to discontinue selling any product or service at any time without notice.

### Pricing

In the event of a pricing or other error, we reserve the right to revoke offers, cancel orders, and correct errors or omissions, including after an order has been placed. Prices may differ from other promotional prices we or others make available online or retailer prices in your area. In some cases, intermediate markdowns may have been taken.

### Purchases

To purchase products or services through the Platform, you will need to provide certain information, including payment and shipping details. You may be able to store your information in your Account, which allows you to make future purchases without re-entering your information.

We accept all major credit cards: VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. For your security, the billing name and address on your credit card must match your order information or your order may be delayed or cancelled. When you place your order, we may pre-authorize your credit or debit card in the amount of your order, which may have an effect on your available balance or credit line. We may cancel or place holds on your order if we suspect the order may be fraudulent.

All billing and registration information you provide must be accurate, complete and correct. By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for all charges incurred via the applicable payment method for all items, products and/or services that you purchased at the price(s) in effect at that time, including sales taxes. Receiving an order acknowledgement via email does not guarantee acceptance of an order, or that the price or availability of an item has been confirmed.

### Limitations On Purchases

We are not responsible for failure to fulfill orders for any reason, including causes beyond our control. We reserve the right to: (1) decline any order or limit order quantities to reasonable amounts (in our sole discretion); (2) prohibit purchases by retailers, distributors, or resellers; (3) discontinue or refuse to offer any product or service; (4) impose conditions on any discount, coupon or promotion; and/or (5) bar any user from completing a transaction.

### Shipping, Delivery, Install

For our sites that have direct-to-consumer transaction capabilities, please review the Shipping, Delivery & Install policy on the site, accessible from the site’s homepage and incorporated by reference as part of these Terms.

### Product Returns

For our Services and sites that have direct-to-consumer transaction capabilities, please review the Returns, Exchanges, and Cancellations policy on the applicable Service or site, accessible from the site’s homepage and incorporated by reference as part of these Terms.

Smart Appliances & Smart Features
---------------------------------

Refer to your Smart Appliance Use & Care Guide, Quick Reference Guide, or your product brand’s Smart Appliance homepage for information on your appliance’s Smart Features (for US users, see whirlpool.com/connect, maytag.com/connect, jennair.com/connect, or kitchenaid.com/connect; for Canadian users, see whirlpool.ca/connect, maytag.ca/connect, jennair.ca/connect, or kitchenaid.ca/connect). Available Smart Features vary by product model, but may include features such as:

* Remote notifications about your appliances (for example, door open, cycle complete, cooking timer, and others);
* Remote control, allowing you to control your Smart Appliances from the Apps, or through compatible voice services such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa;
* Access to a video feed or images from your camera-equipped Smart Appliance, or to send video or images from your camera-equipped Smart Appliance and/or mobile device to Whirlpool;
* Guides, tips & tricks, and recommendations;
* Enhanced ways to configure your appliance;
* Ways to help automate the way you use your appliances, including laundry and cooking;
* Access to additional appliance features, like additional laundry or cooking cycles;
* Ways to connect and use your Smart Appliances with mobile apps, technologies, products, or services from Whirlpool or its affiliated brands, such as the Yummly® digital recipe platform;
* Ways to connect and use your Smart Appliances with your smart home ecosystem and other smart home products; and
* In the event that your Smart Appliance experiences an error, ways to notify you of the issue and allow you to troubleshoot.

By connecting your Smart Appliance, you agree to allow Whirlpool to support and operate the Smart Features.

### Updates, including Additions, Modifications, or Discontinuations

Business and technology needs frequently evolve. As such, we may add, modify, or discontinue (collectively, “Update”) any or all Smart Features or any other aspect of your Smart Appliances at any time through software updates to your App or Smart Appliance, and you consent to these Updates. You agree to promptly install any Updates and use the most up to date version of software available for your App and your Smart Appliance. If you do not use updated software, or if you have an operating system or mobile device that does not support the most up to date software, you understand that the App or certain App functions may be unavailable or may not function correctly.

You agree that Whirlpool may automatically Update the Smart Features (in whole or in part) at any time and that you will provide Whirlpool with access to do so. In some cases we may Update Smart Features remotely without notifying you, and you consent to these automatic Updates. You acknowledge that Updates may require your Smart Appliance to be reset, restarted, or be temporarily unavailable for use. If you do not wish to receive Updates, delete your appliance from your App. All Smart Features are subject to change, and may be modified or removed at any time through an Update.

### Use of Smart Features

We provide the Smart Features as a convenience, and we hope they make things easier for you. You agree to always use the Smart Features responsibly, and use proper care, good judgment, and common sense. In particular, you agree to exercise caution by adhering to the following:

* When doing laundry, follow any instructions or guidelines that come with your fabrics.
* When cooking, always follow recommended guidelines (such as from your country’s food authorities), monitor your food during the entire cooking process, and be sure to check your food for doneness before eating. Consuming undercooked foods (such as meats, poultry, seafood, or eggs) may result in illness.
* Always follow your Smart Appliance Use and Care or Quick Reference Guides.
* Do not rely on the Smart Features to prevent accidents, damage, fire, injury, or other hazards.

IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OPERATE YOUR SMART APPLIANCE SAFELY AND TO MAINTAIN YOUR SMART APPLIANCE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO YOUR SMART APPLIANCE OR PROPERTY, BODILY HARM, AND/OR SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.

### Internet and Mobile Usage

Smart Features require you to have a wireless Internet connection and data connectivity for your Smart Appliance and mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining, maintaining and paying for all network devices (modems, routers, etc.) and data plans. To help ensure the security of your Smart Appliance, you are responsible for keeping your network and devices up to date and following all recommendations from your network device manufacturers. This includes ensuring that your router’s firmware and software and mobile device software are fully up-to-date with all available updates and patches. Our Services may not be compatible with devices unless they are kept up-to-date, including with an up-to-date operating system. If your device cannot support an up-to-date operating system, you may not be able to utilize the Services. You are responsible for ensuring that your device can support an up-to-date operating system that is compatible with our Services.

### Multiple User Appliances

In general, when you connect your account to your Smart Appliance, your account will have administrative control over your Smart Appliance. However, some Smart Appliances may be connected to multiple accounts (“Multiple User Appliances”). For Multiple User Appliances, the first account to connect (“Primary Account”) will have administrative control and may have the ability to subsequently authorize other accounts to connect (“Secondary Accounts”). The Primary Account may have access to features and functions not available for the Secondary Account. The Primary Account is solely responsible for all use of the Smart Appliance by any Secondary Account users as though their activity had occurred under the Primary Account.

### Disconnecting

You can delete your Smart Appliance or delete your account at any time within your App. When you take either of these steps, the Smart Features for your Smart Appliance will no longer be available and your Smart Appliance will stop transmitting data to Whirlpool. To confirm that your Smart Appliance is not transmitting data to Whirlpool, double check that your Smart Appliance is disconnected from your router (for example, by resetting your Smart Appliance’s network settings or having your appliance “Forget” your home network).

Although deactivating your account will stop you from receiving further Smart Appliance notifications, it will not automatically opt you out of receiving other communications from Whirlpool and its brands, such as emails. Please review the applicable Privacy Notice for details on how to change your communications preferences.

Whirlpool may terminate your use of the Smart Features at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice. Whirlpool may deactivate or delete your user name, password and account, and all associated materials, without any obligation to provide any further access to such materials, without notice. Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted under this Agreement, including your right to use the Smart Features, will immediately cease.

### Transferring your Smart Appliance

You may sell, loan or give your Smart Appliance to someone else. If you do, you agree to: (i) tell them that it is a Smart Appliance; and (ii) delete the Smart Appliance from your App or delete your account within the App. After selling, loaning, or giving your Smart Appliance, your right to use the Smart Appliance and the Smart Features automatically terminates and you agree to not attempt to access or use the Smart Appliance or interfere with anyone else’s access to or use of the Smart Appliance.

### App Store Terms

The availability of the Services may depend on the third-party platforms from which you download the App, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play (each an “App Store”). You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and Whirlpool, and not with the operator of an App Store. The App Store provider is not responsible for maintenance or other support for the App. You also agree to comply with any App Store terms and conditions. To the extent that any App Store terms and conditions are less restrictive than or otherwise conflict with the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.

Service Availability

If you provide us with any ideas, proposals, suggestions or other materials relating to the Services or any other Whirlpool products or services, Whirlpool may use the feedback in any manner for any purpose without restriction or compensation to you.
