4.6 External services and content on our website
------------------------------------------------

We integrate external services and content on our website. If you use one of these services or you are shown the content of third parties, communication data is exchanged between you and the provider of that service or content for technical purposes.  
That provider may use your data for their own purpose. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we have configured the services or content of third-party providers who are known to use data for their own purposes so that communication for purposes other than rendering their content or services on our website is prevented or communication does not come about unless you actively decide to use the service. However, since we have no control over the data collected by third parties and its processing by them we are unable to make any binding statements pertaining to the purpose and scope of the processing of your data.  
For further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of your data, please refer to the privacy policy of the responsible provider (under data protection law) of the services or content integrated by us:

4.7 Processing of your data by using a Connector ID (C-ID)
----------------------------------------------------------

4.7.1 Creation of the Connector ID (mutual responsibility)
----------------------------------------------------------

As long as you have given C-ID online consent according to cypher 4.7.4.2, we transfer the Cookie-ID, the IP address gathered while placing the cookie, and device information to the Bertelsmann Data Services GmbH, Carl-Bertelsmann-Str. 270, 33311 Gütersloh („BDS“). BDS processes this data to generate a unique Connector-ID („C-ID“). Subsequently, this data is deleted by BDS. The C-ID is an indicator allowing the respectively involved Bertelsmann business unit to determine which data base of the other involved Bertelsmann business units contains an existing person saved in their own data base.  
Moreover, we transmit the ID (Customer-ID) that we have allocated to your data set to our data catalog, as well as, an anonymized data catalog to BDS. The anonymized data catalog consists of aggregated, non-personal information on data saved in our customer data base (“anonymous data catalog”). For all involved Bertelsmann business units, BDS centrally gathers and manages the C-ID, the customer ID, information on the anonymous data catalog and which consent to a C-ID exists in the involved Bertelsmann business units.  
  
The data processing mentioned above happens to ensure our and the eligible interests of the other Bertelsmann business units involved based on article 6 (1) (f) DS-GVO (GDPR). This initially happens, to allow us and the involved Bertelsmann business units to estimate via a request to the BDS, within which of the involved Bertelsmann business units the same C-ID exists and which potential the anonymous data catalog offers for data exchange. Furthermore, this is to enable us and the other involved Bertelsmann business units to exchange data based on interest assessment (cypher 4.7.2) using the C-ID or if your consent was given, to send you interesting and useful offers as well as advertisements and to design the respective websites, products and services accordingly.  
  
You can access the currently involved Bertelsmann business units at [https://dataservices.bertelsmann.de/participatingcompanies/](https://dataservices.bertelsmann.de/participatingcompanies/)  or request them postally or via email at [Send email](#) .  
For data processing during the creation of the C-ID we and BDS are mutually responsible in terms of data protection law. In this respect we have determined a common agreement ac-cording to article 26 DS-GVO on who of us fulfills which duties according to the DS-GVO (GDPR). This particularly affects exercising the rights of the affected persons and the fulfill-ment of the information obligation according to article 13 and 14 DS-GVO (GDPR).  
  
This agreement is necessary because personalized data is being processed in the different steps of the C-ID creation, which are either operated by us, the BDS or by both parties to-gether. Even when the mutual responsibility exists, in terms of data protection law, each party fulfills their own duties accordingly to their responsibilities for the individual process section as follows:

* For the process of transmitting of the above-mentioned data we are responsible.
* For generating the C-ID we and BDS are mutually responsible.
* For managing the C-ID as well as the deletion of data described above, transmitted to BDS for the C-ID creation, BDS is responsible.

You can allege your data protection rights with Bertelsmann Data Services GmbH, Corporate Data Protection, Carl-Bertelsmann-Str. 270, 33311 Gütersloh, Germany, or by email at [Send email](#) .

4.7.2 Processing operations using the C-ID regardless of your consent
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Regardless of the presence of your consent we and other involved Bertelsmann business units can share and use your name, your address, your contact data (if available) your date of birth (if available), and interest categories using the C-ID, when the requirements of article 6 (1) (f) DS-GVO (GDPR) is present, to send you interesting and useful offers as well as advertisements and to design the respective websites, products and services accordingly. Interest category means belonging to a group of addressees that have similar general characteristics (e.g. belonging to the same age group) or a comparable potential interest in specific products or services (e.g. purchases of the same product category, user of the same media content, e.g. TV series enthusiast). When choosing target group specific advertisement or adequate designs for offers, we can also use and additionally save anonymized information as well as data that we have received from data providers based on article 6 (1) (f) DS-GVO (GDPR), sufficiently considering your interests.

4.7.3 Right of objection
------------------------

You can object to the use of your data for the data processing described in cypher 1.1 and 1.2 at any time, as described under cypher 7. Your data will then no longer be used for these purposes in the future.

4.7.4 Processing using the C-ID based on your consent
-----------------------------------------------------

4.7.4.1 Using your IP address and cookie ID to generate the C-ID
----------------------------------------------------------------

When you use our offer, we set a cookie with your consent, in which we store a cookie ID. The cookie ID is a randomly generated character string that is used by our offer as an identifier in subsequent invocations. This cookie is a small text file that is stored by your Internet browser. If you have also given your C-ID online consent in accordance with cypher 4.7.4.2, we will transmit the cookie ID, the IP address collected when the cookie was set and information about your terminal device to BDS to generate the C-ID. The legal basis for the collection and transmission of this data is article 6 (1) (a) DS-GVO (GDPR).

4.7.4.2 Consent to the cross-offer processing of data by Bertelsmann companies for analysis, product development, measurement, advertising and risk management ("C-ID Online Consent")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have given your consent to the cross-offer processing of data by Bertelsmann compa-nies across all offers for analysis, product development, measurement, advertising, and risk management ("C-ID Online Consent") to us, BDS or a Bertelsmann company involved, your data will be processed - in addition to the purposes described in cypher 4.7.2 - on the basis of article 6 (1) (a) DS-GVO (GDPR) as follows:

We, the other Bertelsmann companies involved, and BDS share and use the following data (if available, hereinafter referred to as "Online Data") using the C-ID, in each case under our own responsibility:

* Your IP address;
* Details about the content you have requested and about your usage behavior (e.g. which web pages and sections you have viewed and when);
* the content you enter on the website (e.g. search terms, login data, ratings, form entries, click data);
* The date and time of access, information about the Internet browser you are using, the duration of your visit to the site, and the page you previously visited from which you accessed our site; and
* Device information such as the terminal device model and other information about your device (e.g. browser, language, time zone settings, operating system, platform, and screen resolution);

to personalize ads and content on the websites and apps of the participating Bertelsmann business units or BDS based on a profile and to measure the performance of ads and content on these websites and apps. Furthermore, insights can be derived about target groups that have viewed the ads and content. Finally, your online data may be used to build or improve the usability, systems, and software of participating Bertelsmann business units. Furthermore, findings/profiles derived in this way can be transmitted between the Bertelsmann companies involved on the basis of the C-ID and used for the aforementioned purposes.  
Moreover, we use the C-ID to pass on your online data/profiles to other involved Bertelsmann business units so that they can automatically check whether there are any indications of possible fraudulent conduct when ordering paid content, goods or services from these Bertelsmann business units or third parties for whom this Bertelsmann business unit provides payment services. This also includes the decision whether a high-risk payment method such as purchase on account can be offered for this order. The online data/profiles shared between the involved Bertelsmann business units using the C-ID will not be passed on to the third party.  
Details can be found in the respective consent dialog of the offer for which you give consent. If you have given consent to the processing of your online data for this purpose, you can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future, as described under 4.4. In this case, the processing of your data described above will no longer take place.

5\. Who comes into possession of my personal data?
--------------------------------------------------

Within our company those who need access to your information for the purposes described in section 4 will be given access to it. Service providers contracted by us may also be given access to your information (“contract data processors”, e.g. data centers, mailing services for newsletters, web tracking). They are bound by our directives and must provide for data security and the confidential treatment of your information under the contract data processing agreements we have concluded with them.  
No sharing of information with other recipients such as advertising partners, providers of social media services or credit institutions (“third parties”) takes place.

6\. Is my personal data processed outside of the EU or EEA (‘transfer to a third country’)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of Google Analytics as described in section 4.4 above causes personal data to be transferred to a third country since the data centers of Google Inc. are located outside of the European Union and the European Economic Area (“EU or EEA”). Such transfers of personal data to third countries may result in your personal information being transmitted to a country which does not provide for the same standard of data protection as the EU or EEA.

[7\. What data privacy rights do I have?](https://www.bertelsmann.com/meta/privacy/#anc_2848453)

You also have the right to request a copy of the personal data provided by you in a structured, commonly-used, machine-readable format (right to data portability).   
  
If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal information for specific purposes, you can revoke that consent at any time for the future. Your notice of revocation is to be addressed to us by writing to the contact address indicated in section 1.

10\. Microsoft Teams based Online Meetings
------------------------------------------

Here you will find information about the processing of your personal data in the context of participation in an Microsoft Teams-based online meeting (hereinafter only "online meeting" or “Teams meeting”)

**Who is responsible for processing my data ?**  
As a rule, the company from which you have received an invitation to a Teams meeting is responsible within the meaning of data protection law. It may also be that you receive an invitation from one company only on behalf of another - in this case, the organizer may provide you with more details. In addition, you will find the relevant company addresses to which you can address a data protection concern with the address supplement "To the Data Protection Officer" on the website of the Group company concerned.

**What personal data is processed ?**  
Two types of data are processed in the context of online meetings: systemically required data and data that is generated through your interaction in the context of the meeting.  
Systemically required data is information about your access and the conduct of the meeting: login (time, day), IP address, email address, meeting ID, authorizations (e.g. whether you are allowed to share your screen) and hardware information. In addition, data is processed depending on how you interact in the meeting (interaction data), so, for example, chat messages that you write might be recorded. If you switch on your camera, video files about you will be processed. Use of the video function is voluntary. In online meetings, as in normal (VoIP) telephone calls, audio files are processed for communication between the participants.

**For what purposes and on what basis is my data processed?**  
The processing takes place in order to conduct online meetings (using audio and/or video functions). In principle, processing is carried out for the purpose of carrying out online meetings on the basis of our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR) in order to provide an efficient communication platform that is available to many people. In special situations, however, more specific legal bases may apply. For example, your consent is always obtained (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR) if an online meeting is recorded. No recording will be made without your consent. If the online meeting is held in the context of contractual negotiations or relationships, Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR may also be the legal basis for processing. If we are legally obliged to process data, the lawfulness is based on Art. 6 (1) c GDPR.

**Who receives my data?**  
Both systemically required data and interaction data processed in connection with participation in online meetings will not be passed on to third parties. Data such as video, chat or voice are shared with the participants during the conference. If a recording is to be made available to other parties at a later date, for example for training courses or product presentations, this will be communicated separately. We use Microsoft Teams, a service provided by Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA to conduct our online meetings. Microsoft acts as a data processor for us for the purposes described herein. This means that Microsoft may only process the above-mentioned data on our instructions and not for its own purposes.

**Will my data be transferred to a third country?**  
In principle, your data will not be transferred to a country outside the EU/EEA. However, in the event of malfunctions, Microsoft may access your data remotely to assist us with troubleshooting. In these cases, we have taken appropriate measures to ensure an equivalent level of data protection at Microsoft.

**How long will my data be stored?**  
The data is stored for as long as it is required for the stated purposes, unless longer storage is required by law. If we obtain your consent to a recording, the storage period is specified according to the scope of the respective consent. The recording will be deleted by the recording party as soon as it is no longer required. Systemically required data is usually deleted after 30 days.

**What rights do I have in relation to my data?**  
You are entitled to all rights under Chapter III GDPR: In addition to the right of access (Art. 15), you have the right to rectification of your data (Art. 16), erasure (Art. 17), restriction (Art. 18) and the right to object to data processing (Art. 21) or to receive a copy of the data concerning you (Art. 20), if the respective eligibility requirements are met. If you have given your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. Finally, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
