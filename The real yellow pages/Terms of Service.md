12\. Third-Party Intellectual Property Policy
---------------------------------------------

### 12.1 Copyright Policy

Thryv, Inc. respects the copyright of others and we expect our users of the YP Sites and Service to do the same. We have adopted a policy towards alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). We reserve the right to remove, suspend, terminate access, or take other appropriate actions against users or third parties that we believe, in good faith, to be repeat offenders of our policy against infringing copyrighted material. It is important to note that Thryv, Inc. does not determine copyright ownership in the event of a dispute. We will remove content, as required by law, from our site if we receive a complete and valid takedown notice. The party whose material has been removed then has the ability to respond with a counter notice. If and when we receive a valid counter notification, we will forward it to the person who submitted the original takedown request. If the dispute continues, it will be up to the two parties to settle the issue.

### 12.2 To File a Copyright Complaint (DMCA)

1. If you believe that any material on or accessible through the YP Sites or Service infringes your copyright, pursuant to section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA , please send us a written notice requesting takedown per the DMCA, containing the following necessary information to our Designated Agent, listed below, or to [dmcanotices@thryv.com](mailto:dmcanotices@thryv.com):
    1. Identification of the copyrighted work(s) or material(s) claimed to be infringed;

    5. Include the following statement:_"The information in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."_; and
    6. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. After receiving a properly-submitted DMCA notice sent to our Designated Agent, it is our policy to:
    1. Remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing work or material;

    3. In the case of repeat infringers, remove the allegedly infringing material and terminate such content provider's access to the service.

**Please note that, if we take action on your request, our notification to the content provider, member or user who posted the allegedly-infringing material includes a complete copy of your Copyright Complaint (which may include your name, address, phone and email address). If you do not wish your contact information to be provided, you may want to consider using an agent to report the complaint on your behalf.**

### 12.3 Copyright Complaint (DMCA) Counter-Notification Policy

    1. Identification of the material that was mistakenly removed or disabled from access, in writing;

    5. Include the statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located or any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the notification under Section 512(c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person."; and
    6. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user.
2. If we receive a valid counter-notification, we may send a copy of such notice to the original complaining party informing them that we may restore the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 to 14 business days.

If they believe the content was improperly removed, they will be encouraged to contact you directly to resolve the issue.
