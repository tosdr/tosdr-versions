The reasons are:

    * there is a risk that supply of the products may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control;

This is subject to exception in section 9.4 below and certain deductions may be applicable (for example to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them).
* To exercise the right to change your mind and to cancel, you must inform us of your decision by a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail), please [**contact us here**](https://www.finishdishwashing.com/help-and-support/).

* Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind. Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind, you can still end the contract before the product is delivered and paid for, but you may have to pay us compensation. Just contact us here to let us know. The contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid for products not provided but we may deduct from that refund (or, if you have not made an advance payment, charge you) reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.
* We will pay the costs of return:
    * if the products are faulty or misdescribed;
    * if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong;
    * if you are exercising your right to change your mind within fourteen (14) days and have not use the product or altered the packaging.

In all other circumstances you must pay the costs of return including if we are collecting the product from you.

* How we will refund you. If you are eligible for a refund, we will reimburse the price paid for the relevant product onto the credit or debit card that it was paid with.
