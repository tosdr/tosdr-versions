This Notice describes the types of Personal Data that Company may collect or process, how we may use and disclose that Personal Data, and how you may exercise any rights you may have regarding our processing of your Personal Data.

This Notice applies to Personal Data collected or processed by us online (through websites, applications, email, and otherwise) (“**Online Services**”); and in other situations where you interact with us, including but not limited to interacting with or visiting our sites and offices or our events (e.g., tradeshows and conferences) (such products, services, Online Services, and other systems collectively, the “**Products and Services**”); when we process your data as an employee of a company for which we provide Products or Services; or anywhere this Notice is posted or referenced. This Notice also applies to Personal Data that is collected or processed when you interact with us in person, by telephone, or by mail.

**Marketing Uses, Cookies, and Other Activities** 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, including in accordance with your consent where required by applicable law, we may engage in the following activities:

* We may use your contact details to contact you to determine whether you would like to initiate a business relationship with us or to send you marketing emails. If you do not wish to receive such marketing emails, you may opt out by declining to receive such emails when registering or in our subsequent communications by following opt-out instructions included in the email or at other information collection points on the Online Services.
* We may display advertisements to you regarding Products and Services that we believe are relevant to you based on your activities on the Online Services or on other web or digital properties. Such advertisements may be shown on our Online Services or the online services of others. We achieve this by using, and allowing third parties (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn) to use certain cookies, eTags, pixels, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to track your activities on our Online Services and other online services. For more information about these activities and how to manage or opt out of them, please see our Notice on Cookies.

* We also perform statistical analyses of the users of our Online Services to improve the functionality, content, design, and navigation of the Online Services.

**Processing Using Website Tracking**

On certain of our websites, we use Google Analytics, to help us understand how users engage with this and other of our websites. Google Analytics may track your activity on our sites (i.e., the pages you have seen and the links you have clicked on) and helps us measure how you interact with the content that we provide. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve the sites. The reports we receive disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. Learn more about [Google’s privacy practices](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites), and exercise the opt-out provided by Google by downloading the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), or as described in our Notice on Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. We will honor such ‘Do-Not-Track’ requests. 

**Interactive Features of our Websites**

To the extent we offer any public or group forums on our Products or Services, such as newsfeeds, blogs, message boards, or similar tools (“**Interactive Features**”), the posts or comments you make may be public and viewed by others. You should use care before posting information about yourself, including Personal Data. You acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to Interactive Features over the Products and Services. Except when required to do so by applicable law, we assume no obligation to remove Personal Data you post on our Products and Services, and your disclosure of any Personal Data through the Interactive Features is at your own risk.

Rewards Programs
----------------
