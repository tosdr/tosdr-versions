Privacy Policy and Data Protection
==================================

Policy Updated 23rd May 2018

Wild Sparks Enterprises value and protect your privacy

This policy explains when and why we collect information about you, how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.

We may change this Policy from time to time so please check this page occasionally to ensure that you’re happy with any changes. By using our website, you’re agreeing to be bound by this Policy.

Any questions regarding this Policy and our privacy practices should be sent by email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.science-sparks.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Who are we?
-----------

Science Sparks™ is an online education site founded in 2011 by Emma Vanstone. We are based in the UK but have contributing authors from around the world.

How we Collect Information About You
------------------------------------

Information is collected via log files, cookies, leaving comments on the site or subscribing to our newsletter.

What Information do we Collect About You
----------------------------------------

We collect information on your name, email address, website (if you leave this in a comment), IP address and the pages that you visited and when you visited them on the site.

How and Why we Track your Visit
-------------------------------

Like most websites around the world we use Google Analytics (GA) to process information about the number of visitors on our site, and their behaviour

We use this information to record the number of people using Science Sparks and to better understand where you discover our site (from social media, google or another site) and how you use it as well as to see how people move throughout the site.

GA records your approximate location down to town level, the type device you are using e.g. Mobile or Table, Name of device e.g. iPad or Samsung Galazy etc…, operating system e.g. Windows 10 or iOS and browser e.g. Firefox or Chrome none of this data can be used to identify you.

Google does record your IP address however, we don’t have access to this information and it modifies it so that you can not be identified specifically just the area that you are in.

### Google Analytics Demographics

We are committed to ensuring that our website contains content that is valuable and useful to our readers.

To help us with this we have implemented the Google analytics demographics and interest reporting features on our website.

These tools allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of website visitors and adapt our website content to better reflect their needs.

Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format.

This means we cannot identify what information is about you, and we will not try to figure it out.

You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customise Google Display Network ads using the [Google Ad settings](https://adssettings.google.ca/anonymous?sig=ACi0TCim925cB07-7cpwU1t82Zih-cyZJ-z258Rhs2_ob_VD9-KN0PF7SNjosxPqWAnMkL5o3KkIzcaiKhInpLNrtrjGb3FOZ2AF3COImtlEVfU_oOnno0I&hl=en) or through the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

To do this Google Analytics uses a “cookie” on your machine read more about Cookies below.

Leaving a Comment on our Site
-----------------------------

We love feedback on all our activities so love it when people leave a comment.

To leave a comment you may leave it anonymously or leave a name, email address, website and comment.

We only use this information to identify you as the comment maker and do not pass this on to any third party.

Your email address will never be shown in the comment section of the site.

Your details will remain in the database unless we remove it or the article is removed from the site.

You may request that we delete the comment and remove you details at any time. Please email to ask for this to be carried out.

If you are under 16 you must obtain your parents permission before leaving a comment.

We send emails 1 – 3 times a week and with our tracking try and make these as relevant to you as possible. From time to time we may include promotions for products.

Advertisements on Science Sparks™
---------------------------------
