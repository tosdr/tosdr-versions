Privacy Policy
==============

At **Delaware North Companies, Inc.**, we take the privacy of your personal information seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines the ways we collect your personal information, how we use it, how and to whom we disclose it, and your rights in relation to the personal information that we process. In addition, it explains how we use that information and how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect. All references to “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall mean **Delaware North Companies, Inc.** If the practices described in this Privacy Policy are not acceptable to you, you should not provide Company with information about yourself. We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. The “Last Updated” date at the bottom of the page tells you when this Privacy Policy was last revised. We will notify you of material changes by posting notice on our website (“Website”) or through other means. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on our Website. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our Privacy Policy whenever you visit our Website for any updates or changes.

Collection of Your Personal Information

“Personal Information” refers to information that relates to an identified, or identifiable, person or household. This includes, for example, your first and last name, home address or email address. We may also collect and process sensitive Personal Information, such as Social Security number, payment card number, driver’s license identification, or precise geolocation, as further described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to Personal Information, we also collect information that does not identify you, such as de-identified or aggregated information. The Personal Information that we collect depends on what services you use or information that you request. Our collection and processing of your information is based on different contexts: our performance of a contract, our obligations under law, our legitimate interest in conducting our business, protection of a natural person’s vital interests and/or upon your consent.

The chart below lists the categories of Personal Information that we have collected in the last twelve (12) months.

Retention of Information
------------------------

We retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, or until an individual makes a valid request that we delete information about them, unless a longer retention period is required or is permitted by law.

Your Privacy Rights

Depending on where you reside, applicable law may provide you with additional privacy rights, such as the right to confirm that we are processing your Personal Information, the right of access or the right to correct your Personal Information. You may also have the right to delete some or all of the Personal Information we have collected about you; valid requests to delete may be fulfilled by deleting or de-identifying this information, although we will retain any information we are required to keep by law. You may also have the right to opt-out of certain processes, such as targeted advertising and to obtain a portable and useable copy of the information you provided to us.

To exercise these rights, please contact us through one of the following means:

* Calling us at1-877-313-2605.
* Emailing us at [privacy@delawarenorth.com](mailto:privacy@delawarenorth.com).
* Sending a letter to 250 Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, New York 14202; Attention: Data Privacy.

Please note that if you make a request, we will need to verify or authenticate your identity (that you are the person that is the subject of the request, the legal guardian of that person, or in some jurisdictions an authorized representative) to carry out the requests. In order to verify your identity, we may ask for certain additional information that we will only use for the purpose of this verification. If we can’t authenticate your identity, we will let you know. Note, in order to maximize the potential that we can identify you when you make a request, please use the information you provided to us, for example when you registered with one of our Websites or otherwise communicated with us. If you use Personal Information not in our possession when you make a request, we may not be able to identify you.

If we require more time (up to 90 days in certain circumstances), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

If we cannot process your request, we will inform you of the reason why. For data portability requests, where applicable, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without undue hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If, under applicable law, we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### Non-Discrimination

We do not discriminate against consumers who exercise any of their rights described in this section.

### Appeal Rights

If we deny a request you make concerning your Personal Information, you may have the right to appeal that denial. If so, we will provide you information concerning your appeal right when we deny your request.

Miscellaneous
-------------

### Aggregate Information

We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our Website whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of “click stream” information such as entry and exit points for our Website (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when you request pages on our Website, our servers automatically log your Internet Protocol addresses. An Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the internet.

We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to the Website from affiliate websites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.

This aggregate information generally will not identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information, provided that such information does not reveal your identity. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any aggregate information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy.

### Links to Other Sites

Please be aware that we provide links to third-party websites as a service to our users, and that we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those pages. Please note that these websites’ privacy policies may differ from our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.

### Transmission of Information to Other Countries

As a multi-national company, we transmit information between and among Company, our subsidiaries and/or our affiliate companies. As a result, your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By submitting your Personal Information to us, you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States of America. If you would like more information concerning where we process your information, you can contact us pursuant to the “How to Contact Us” section below.

### Third Party Tracking

You can opt out of receiving advertising based on your browsing behavior from some network advertising companies by going to the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/) websites, although to completely prevent advertising based upon your browsing behavior you should also disable the cookies on your browser.

### Children Under the Age of 16

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16. Our Website is not directed at persons under the age of 16 and should not be used by them. In no event should children under the age of 16 provide any Personal Information through our website. More information about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and how it protects children who use the Internet may be found at [www.ftc.gov](file://hsefile/tsprofiles$/NRportbl/NRPortbl/WORKSITE/SCHWALBL/www.ftc.gov).
