Privacy Policy
==============

At **Delaware North Companies, Inc.**, we take the privacy of your personal information seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines the ways we collect your personal information, how we use it, how and to whom we disclose it, and your rights in relation to the personal information that we process. In addition, it explains how we use that information and how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect. All references to “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall mean **Delaware North Companies, Inc.** If the practices described in this Privacy Policy are not acceptable to you, you should not provide Company with information about yourself. We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. The “Last Updated” date at the bottom of the page tells you when this Privacy Policy was last revised. We will notify you of material changes by posting notice on our website (“Website”) or other mobile or other web-based application (“Application”) (collectively, the “Website”) or through other means. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on our Website. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our Privacy Policy whenever you visit our Website for any updates or changes.

In this context, we are often a service provider to the third party (e.g., providing concessions at sports venues or otherwise providing food, beverage, and other services at client owned locations) or operate our location under a third-party brand (e.g., franchisor). These third parties may require that we share your Personal Information with them. Their use of your Personal Information is governed by their independent data collection and use practices and privacy policies, which may differ from our privacy policy. You should review their privacy policies to determine how they use and disclose your Personal Information, along with any choices you may have regarding the same.

### Business Transition

Certain cookie providers require that we include certain information about our use of their cookies. Below is the information we are required to disclose as of the policy Effective Date. Since this list may change, you should periodically check the list for any updates.

* The Website uses Google Analytics.

Protecting Your Information
---------------------------

To help maintain data accuracy, prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of, and ensure the appropriate use of your Personal Information, we have put in place administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access to your Personal Information, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

Retention of Information
------------------------

We retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, or until an individual makes a valid request that we delete information about them, unless a longer retention period is required or is permitted by law.

Your Privacy Rights
-------------------

Depending on where you reside, applicable law may provide you with certain privacy rights, such as:

* **Changes to Your Personal Information**. We rely on you to update and correct your Personal Information. Most of our Websites allow you to modify or delete your account profile. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law. If our Website does not permit you to update or correct certain information, contact us with such request pursuant to the “Your Privacy Rights” section below.
* **Deletion of Your Personal Information**. You may request that we delete your Personal Information by contacting us with such request pursuant to the “Your Privacy Rights” section below and we will delete such Personal Information to the extent required by law. Valid requests to delete may be fulfilled by deleting or de-identifying this information, although we will retain any information we are required to keep by law.
* **Revocation of Consent and/or Objections to Processing**. If we are processing your Personal Information based on your consent, you may revoke consent, or object, to specific processing of your Personal Information by contacting us with such request. If you revoke your consent for or object to the processing of Personal Information, then we may no longer be able to provide you services. In some cases, we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent or object to processing if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We note, however, that the majority of our processing is not based on consent.
* **Right to Know/Access to Your Personal Information**. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the Personal Information that we have about you. You may request access to, or a portable copy of, your Personal Information by contacting us with such request pursuant to the “Your Privacy Rights” section below.

Please note that if you make a request, we will need to verify or authenticate your identity (that you are the person that is the subject of the request, the legal guardian of that person, or in some jurisdictions an authorized representative) to carry out the requests. In order to verify your identity, we may ask for certain additional information that we will only use for the purpose of this verification. If we can’t authenticate your identity, we will let you know. Note, in order to maximize the potential that we can identify you when you make a request, please use the information you provided to us, for example when you registered with one of our Websites or otherwise communicated with us.

### Response Timing and Format

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt or as otherwise required by law. If we require more time (up to 90 days in certain circumstances), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

If we cannot process your request, we will inform you of the reason why. For data portability requests, where applicable, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without undue hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If, under applicable law, we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### Non-Discrimination

We do not discriminate against consumers who exercise any of their rights described in this section.

### Appeal Rights

If we deny a request you make concerning your Personal Information, you may have the right to appeal that denial. If so, we will provide you information concerning your appeal right when we deny your request.

California residents may also be entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of Personal Information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for direct marketing purposes (California “Shine the Light” Rights).
