**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by TheFloridaChannel.org are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than TheFloridaChannel.org website are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through our website (e.g. analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits our website and also when it visits certain other websites.

**Why do we use cookies?**

We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for TheFloridaChannel.org to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Third parties serve cookies through our website for analytics, video delivery and other purposes.

The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our website and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific websites you visit.)

The Cookie Manager that works with your preferred browser can be found on the browser’s website or by searching for “Cookie Manager” using your preferred web search engine (e.g [https://www.google.com/search?&q=cookie+manager&oq=cookie+manager](https://www.google.com/search?&q=cookie+manager&oq=cookie+manager)) . If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality may not be available. You may also amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.
