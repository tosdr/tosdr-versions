Terms of Service
----------------

_Last Updated: 2023-03-06 (explicit mention of ableism)_

These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of the Service provided on the website **pronouns.page** and related subdomains and domains, operated by the “Neutral Language Council” collective and Nero Network (NL, KVK 88409120) who can be contacted via email: [contact@pronouns.page](mailto:contact@pronouns.page).

By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and you consent to us collecting and processing your data as described in [our Privacy Policy](https://en.pronouns.page/privacy).

### Users and accounts

You cannot create an account, if you're barred from it under the laws of your jurisdiction. You cannot create an account, if you're under 13 years old. If you're under 16 years old, you need consent of the holder of parental responsibility.

When you create an account with us, you are responsible for safeguarding the authentication method that you use to access the Service (that is: password to your email account and/or social media platform). You agree not to disclose it to any third party. You must notify us immediately when you become aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

Accounts without any cards and no activity in the last 30 days will be removed and their usernames freed up.

### Content

The Content you post on the Service is yours. By posting it, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any way.

We do not endorse or guarantee truthfulness or safety of the Content posted by other users of the Service, and in particular of any links to any external websites.

It is forbidden to post on the Service any Content that might break the law or violate social norms, including but not limited to: propagation of totalitarian regimes, hate speech, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, enbyphobia, queerphobia, queer exclusionism, sexism, misogyny, ableism, harassment, impersonation, encouraging self-harm and/or suicide, child pornography, broadly understood pedophilia advocacy, unlawful conduct, misinformation, sharing of someone else's personal data, spam, trolling, advertisement, copyright or trademark violations. We reserve the right to interpret as hate-speech all instances of non-obvious, concealed hate speech (eg. telling some people to “DNI” because of their queer identity, transphobic dogwhistles like “superstraight” or “semibisexual”, etc.).

You are responsible for any Content posted on the Service. If you violate these Terms of Service, we will remove your Content without prior notice and we might revoke your license to use the Service. If you break the law, we will pass your information to law enforcement agencies.
