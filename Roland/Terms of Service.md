#### Miscellaneous:

We reserve the right to change any information on this Website, including but not limited to terminating the Service or revising and/or deleting features or other information without prior notice to you.

(See “Links from and to the Service” above.) The content of this Website may vary depending upon your browser functionality and limitations.

You and Roland each agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the Tokyo District Court or Tokyo Summary Court located in Tokyo, Japan. The Terms and Conditions and the relationship between you and Roland shall be governed by the laws of Japan, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree to comply with all local rules, in whatever jurisdiction, including those outside of Japan, regarding online conduct and the use of personal information. You further agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of data exported from the country in which you reside and from which your access to the Service originated.

The failure of Roland to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect.
