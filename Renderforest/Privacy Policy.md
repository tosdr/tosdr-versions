The video projects you create and the media files you upload from your device are saved on your personal media library. Renderforest may permanently delete your personal files after 60 days from your last activity, if you have not made any purchase.

Your profile and edited videos will be available only to you as a sole user. The videos you created with Renderforest will be available on ‘My Videos’ page and are marked ‘unlisted’ by default. That means only people with the link can see your videos. You can make them private if you do not wish anybody else but yourself to have access to them or you can make them available for other Renderforest users to see or share. In this case, we do not accept responsibility for the way they will use that data.

Also, Renderforest provides its users the opportunity to interact and post content through various social media sites. Your interactions with such websites are publicly viewable outside of the website domain. Each social media site has its own privacy policy which may more or less protect the interests of those website owners than this privacy policy protects our and your interests. If you do not wish for this information to be disclosed, then you should not use these online tools.

Please, think carefully before giving your information to anyone else or making it publicly available.

The images you choose to share with us are cached to make data exchange easier and quicker.

If you decide to delete any media files, they will still be available via the corresponding file link as long as the TTL (Time to Live) has not expired.

#### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.

#### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

Forms of Disclosure

We do use services of third-party providers to operate our website. These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform such functions on our behalf and authorized to use your personal information to provide these services to us.

The services include credit card processings, analytics service providers, customer service, YouTube API services and transactional message delivering companies that we believe are in full compliance with the applicable legislation. As their services require, we may transfer as much of your personal information to them as necessary for them to perform their services.

Apart from third party providers, we may also disclose your personal information in the following situations:

* Under the specific circumstances where we are authorized or required by law to do so.

Your personal data will only be used to protect our legitimate interests and will never be provided to other parties for advertising, marketing or other commercial uses without your consent.

#### Security of Your Personal Data

The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.  
While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### Protection of Your Information

Renderforest will store all user information in secure databases protected in a variety of industry-standard access controls to assist us in protecting your data. However, no company can fully eliminate security risks associated with the transmission of personal information through online transactions, and you do so at your own risk.

We offer the use of a secure server and implement various security measures to keep the safety of any personal information you submit to Renderforest. All sensitive information (such as credit card details) are stored on secure servers that are managed by Renderforest and our service providers. After any transaction, your credit card details and financial information are immediately deleted from our servers.

Renderforest may also employ some safety procedures to help protect your information from loss, unauthorized access, alteration or destruction.

If you have any questions about security measures on this website, please send us an email at  [dpo@renderforest.com](mailto:dpo@renderforest.com).

Renderforest may process non-personal and personal Information from your end users solely on your behalf. When a user collects the end user data via third party services like Gmail or manages the contacts via the user platform, Renderforest stores this data on behalf of the user and in no way shall be considered a controller of such data. The users controlling and operating such users-of-users Information are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations that may apply to the collection, control and use of such data.
