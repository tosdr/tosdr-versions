Social features are a core component of our games. Other players and users may, for example, see your profile data, in-game activities and read the messages you have posted.

**PARTNERS WORKING FOR OLD SKULL GAMES.**

Old Skull Games has partners to perform services for us. These partners process your data only at and according to Old Skull Games’ instructions to provide the Service, such as hosting, player support, advertising, analytics and fraud prevention.

**Other companies and public authorities.**

In order to combat fraud and illegal activity, we may exchange data with other companies and organizations and provide it to public authorities in response to lawful requests.

We may also disclose your data based on your consent, to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our players or others.

The Service includes features from our partners, such as social media interaction tools and in-game advertising. A list of these partners is available at https:// oldskullgames.com/partner-opt-out. These partners may access your data and operate under their own privacy policies. We encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their data processing practices.

**INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**
--------------------------------

Our Service is global by nature and your data can therefore be transferred to anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than your own country, we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
--------------------------------

Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyze use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.

**Security Safeguards.**

In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.

**Data retention.**

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.  
Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
