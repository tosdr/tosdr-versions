**Section VII. PLACING AN ORDER WITH THE WEBSITE**

This Section provides a detailed explanation and regulation of the features, available in the Website Order form, as well as other policies that regulate placing an Order with the Website.

By filling in the Order form and processing the payment upfront the Customer submits a first offer to the Company, providing all Order details and Order information. After receiving and reviewing the offer, the Company may refuse the Service to the Customer at its sole discretion without providing any reasoning to the Customer. In this case, the pre-paid amount will be refunded to the Customer according to the MoneyBack Policy Section of these Terms and Conditions.

The Customer is responsible for giving the Company accurate and full information concerning the Order, namely writing level, delivery time, number of sources, writing style, discipline, project title, and any other additional information. In case the writing Sample does not suit the Customer‘s needs due to his/her failure to provide accurate information, the Customer is not eligible for a refund. Any amendments to such a Sample may be provided to the Customer for additional fee. The Company reserves the right not to provide any amendments in such cases.

The Customer is responsible for providing all specific sources and materials, required by Order instructions (access to specific books, textbooks, articles, video materials, grading rubrics and other sources and materials that are vital for the Order completion). The Customer may ask the Writer to find specific sources; however, this has to be communicated to the Support Team in the process of placing the Order, and it is not guaranteed that the Writer(s) will have access to the required information. If the Writer cannot find access to this information or materials and the Customer cannot provide it, the Order will be cancelled and refunded according to the MoneyBack Policy Section of these Terms and Conditions.

All instructions for a specific Order have to be provided through Customer‘s personal profile on the Website, namely the Order form and "Files" and "Messages" sections on the Order page of this particular Order, as well as through the email address [support@domyhomework123.com](mailto:support@domyhomework123.com).

Support Team members may require the Customer to confirm the information, provided through Live Chat or phone, through "Messages" or "Files" section of the Website or [support@domyhomework123.com](mailto:support@domyhomework123.com) email address.

_Types of Service_

The Company offers its Customers 4 types of Service: writing, editing, proofreading and other. Proofreading includes basic grammar and spelling check. Editing includes changing the content the Customer provides according to his/ her instructions. Both types of service require the Customer to cover the price for changing an outline, an abstract, and/or a reference page. Other refers to the rest of the services that do not fall under writing/editing/proofreading category or a combination of any of these 3 services.

Note: proofreading and editing types of Service require the Customer to upload the file with the content the Customer needs to have proofread/edited and do not imply adding any content to the file. The writing type of Service presumes that the Writer will complete the sample from scratch according to the Customer‘s instructions.

_Word Count_

1 page double-spaced means and includes at least 300 words, 1 page single-spaced means and includes at least 600 words. The Sample the Customer receives will contain the number of words that at least corresponds to the number of pages the Customer has ordered according to this regulation unless Order instructions specify a maximum word count that is lower than the amount of words ordered. Executives of the Order may provide the Customer with more words per page at their sole discretion when completing the Customer‘s Sample. This is not initiated by the Company and will not in any case become a precedent for any future Orders.

1 PowerPoint slide with speaker notes means and includes 300 words. The obligatory 300 words are distributed between the slide itself and the speaker notes to this specific slide. Speaker notes are included in the .ppt/.pptx file, delivered to the Customer. 1 PowerPoint slide without speaker notes means and includes 100 words. The Writer is responsible for choosing design for the requested PowerPoint presentation, while he/she can also add graphs, images and animation to it (by Customer‘s request or at the Writer‘s sole discretion, unless specified otherwise in the Order instructions).

Word count of 300 words per page double-spaced and 600 words per page single-spaced applies to editing and proofreading services as well. When placing an Order for one of these types of Services, the Customer has to calculate the amount of pages according to the amount of words in the file or part of the file that will be edited/proofread.

Other type of service does not require the Customer to select the word count for the Order since the length of the Sample will be determined by the Expert.

_Title Page, Reference Page, Outline, Abstract and Draft_

When the Customer orders the writing type of Service, he/she can request the following sections to be added to the Paper free of charge (they won‘t be included in the total word count for the Customer‘s Sample):

* _Title page._ The Customer automatically receives a free-of-charge title page in addition to the Sample paper if it is required by the formatting style the Customer has chosen or specified in the "Order Instructions".
* _References list._ A free reference page with all sources that the Writer used in the Sample paper, cited according to the chosen formatting style or guidelines provided in the "Order Instructions", will be added to the Sample paper.
* _Simple Outline._ The Company provides the Customer with a free-of-charge simple outline for the Sample paper if the Customer requests it in "Order Instructions". By simple outline shall be meant structural outline consisting of small phrases for each and every section. Complex outline (also known as a sentence outline) does not come for free and is included in the word count for the Sample paper, if ordered.
* _Abstract._ The Writer can provide the Customer with a free abstract if the Customer orders a Sample of 4 or more pages (double-spaced) and if it is required by the formatting style the Customer has chosen or specified in "Order Instructions".
* _Draft._ The Writer can provide the Customer with a free draft if the Customer requests it when placing the Order, otherwise additional charges may apply. The length of the draft should not exceed 30% of the total length of the order (unless other is agreed with the Writer). The Company offers only one free draft per Order.

The above-mentioned sections will be provided free of charge as long as the Customer requests them when placing the Order, otherwise additional charges may be applied.

_Writer_

The field "Preferred Expert" allows the Customer to choose the Writer they prefer to work on the Sample. The Customer can choose among 3 available options:

1. "Best available" – the Customer does not have any Writer preferences and is willing to work with the best Writer available.
2. "By language proficiency" – the Customer can choose between two options Native (the Company will find a native-speaking Writer to complete the Sample) and Fluent (the Company will find an Expert fluent in English but from a non-English speaking country).
3. "By order ID" – the Customer can provide one of their previous order numbers to request a specific Writer the Customer has already worked with.

_Sources_

The field "Number of sources" refers to the amount of resources (books, articles etc.) the executive of the Order is required to use while completing the Customer‘s Sample. If the Customer does not need the executive to use a specific number of sources, he/she can indicate an approximate number of sources to be used, specifying in the "Project Details" field that the number of sources is approximate. If the Customer indicates "0" in the "in the "Number of Sources" field, he/she authorizes the executive of the Order not to use any resources when writing the Sample.

_Other Regulations_

The Executive of the Order will format the Sample according to the latest edition of the manual of the formatting style selected in the Order form, unless specified otherwise in "Project Details".

Each Order placed by the Customer is received and regarded as a separate project. In case several Orders are connected and have to be completed by the same Writer and/or share the same resources, this needs to be communicated to the Company through the Order form or through the "Messages" section of the correspondent Order(s) within 10 minutes after the Order has been paid for. In case such request is received after 10 minutes have passed since the Order was paid for, an additional payment may be requested.

The Completed Sample is uploaded by the executive of the Order to the "Files" section of the correspondent Order page of the Website. The Sample is not emailed to the Customer automatically. The Customer can request the Sample to be emailed to him/her by contacting the Support Team. The Sample cannot be shipped to the Customer.

Once the completed Sample is uploaded to the "Files" section of the Order page or emailed to the Customer (by the respective request), the Customer shall be the one responsible for retrieving it.

The amount of additional payment will be determined by the executive of the Order. In case of paid revision, the Customer may request the Company to change the Writer that will work on the revision.

The Company can only guarantee that the Customer‘s revision will be completed only after the Writer confirms that he/she can complete it by the agreed deadline.

**Section XI. "NO PLAGIARISM" POLICY**

* The Order contains grammar, punctuation and/or spelling mistakes - up to 30%. In case the Sample contains grammar and/or spelling mistakes, the Customer may qualify for a partial refund if the Customer provides examples of mistakes found.

This regulation does not apply to refund requests due to plagiarism and/or unoriginal content in the Sample.

When the Customer is eligible for a partial or full refund, the Company may offer him/her to leave the money that is to be refunded as a store credit for use in future Orders. The Customer may refuse to leave the money as a store credit and receive a refund instead.
