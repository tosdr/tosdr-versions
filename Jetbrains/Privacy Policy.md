**Why We Collect Data and What We Collect**
-------------------------------------------

We collect data for various reasons, such as:

a) **To provide you with software, services, or information.** We may collect data, including your Personal Data, which are required to provide you with the software, support, and services, including checking for license validation and updates, provision of support, reporting of issues and bugs, and other processing connected with the use of JetBrains software, services, or information. We may use collected data in our development and testing of products and services. You explicitly fill in the Personal Data required for you to receive the software, support, or services, whether you purchase or use JetBrains Products, use our support forums, sign up for a JetBrains Account, register for a webinar, participate in a survey, and/or subscribe to receive marketing and/or technical information and content, or this data is collected in the course of use of JetBrains Products. We may use [third-party service providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html), acting as data processors, to assist us in providing JetBrains Products to you or in our operations. For example, we may use [third-party service providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) to provide data storage and backup services. With your consent, your Personal Data may also be transferred to [third-party service providers](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html), acting as separate data controllers, who provide products and services complementary to JetBrains Products (further data processing performed by these service providers is governed by their privacy policies). The legal basis for this data processing is the performance of a contract between you and us.

b) **To protect us from piracy and unlawful use of our software or services**. We may collect data which are required to protect us from any piracy, unlawful, or unauthorized use of our software or services, or which are necessary to ensure the security of our software or services, including both Personal Data provided by you (see above) and data collected in the course of use of JetBrains Products.

The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in improving our software and services.

d) **For internal evidence of JetBrains and to protect the rights and interests of JetBrains and other users**. We may collect data which are required to keep evidence of provision of software and services to you, of any communication between you and us, of your contact details, of your use of our software and services, of any payments or refunds, and of any issues or disputes between you and us. We may use and disclose these data where we believe, in our sole judgment, that it is legitimate and appropriate to do so to protect our rights and interests and the rights and interests of other users of JetBrains Products or services, or where we believe there has been a violation of this Privacy Policy that could affect the interests of JetBrains or its customers. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in keeping internal evidence and protecting the rights and interests of us and other users.

e) **To promote and market our products and services.** We may use feedback that you provide voluntarily on our products or services. As permitted by applicable law, we may use this in the form of quotes or in other ways in accordance with the JetBrains Terms of Use.

Such [third-party service provider](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/third-parties.html) will act as a data processor and will not use your Personal Data for any other purpose. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in promoting and marketing our products and services.
