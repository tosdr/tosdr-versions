Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
---------------------------------------

When you use our Site, we and our third-party service providers read and store small files of letters and numbers called ‘cookies’ on your browser or on the hard drive of your computer for various purposes further described below. We also use certain other, similar technologies (e.g. local or URL storage) for the same purposes, but we will refer to cookies and all such related technologies as “Cookies” for the sake of simplicity. See below for more information about these technologies.

Unless you have adjusted your browser’s settings so that it will refuse Cookies, our Site will issue (i) strictly necessary Cookies as soon as you visit our Site and (ii) non-necessary Cookies (Statistics, Personalization, and Marketing Cookies) as soon as you give us your consent while visiting our Site (see below for more information).

What Cookies we use and for what purposes

The Cookies we use on our Site are categorized as follows:

a) Strictly necessary

b) Statistics

c) Marketing

d) Personalization

'Strictly Necessary' Cookies – These Cookies let you move around the Site and use essential features like secure areas. Without these Cookies, we cannot provide the requested services. We use strictly necessary Cookies:

a) To identify you as being logged in to our Site and to authenticate you.

b) To make sure you connect to the right service on our Site when we make any changes to the way the Site works.

c) For security purposes.

Accepting these Cookies is a condition of the proper operation of our Site, so if you block these Cookies, the Site may not work correctly and we may not be able to provide our services and products to you.

'Statistics' Cookies – These Cookies collect information about how you use our Site, for example, which pages you visit and whether you experience any errors. Statistics Cookies do not collect any information that could identify you. They are only used to help us improve how our Site works, understand what interests our users, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising. We use Statistics Cookies to:

a) Carry out web analytics and provide statistics on how our Site is used.

b) Obtain data on the number of Site users that have viewed a product.

c) Help us improve the Site by registering any errors that occur.

d) Test different designs for the Site.

Some of our Statistics Cookies are managed for us by third parties. We do not allow such third parties to use these Cookies for any purposes other than those listed above.

'Personalization' Cookies – These are used to provide products or services or to remember settings to improve your visit. We use Personalization Cookies for such purposes as:

a) Remembering settings you've applied, such as layout, text size, language, preferences, and colors.

b) Remembering whether we've already asked you whether you want to take a survey.

c) Remembering whether you have engaged with a particular component or product list on the Site so that it isn’t shown again unnecessarily.

d) Showing you when you're logged in to the Site.

Some of these Cookies are managed for us by third parties. We do not allow such third parties to use these Cookies for any purposes other than those listed above.

'Marketing' Cookies – Marketing Cookies are used to track your visit to our Site and other websites, including the pages you have visited and the links you have followed, which allows third parties to display targeted ads to you on the websites you visit.

We and our third-party service providers use Marketing Cookies to:

a) Link to social networks, such as Facebook, that may subsequently use information about your visit to our Site in order to provide advertising or other offers that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites.

b) Provide third parties with information on your visit so that they can present you with advertisements or other offers that may be of interest to you.

#### YOUR CONSENT / WITHDRAWING CONSENT

You acknowledge that the Site will use Cookies strictly necessary for the functionality of the Site (including security, network management, and accessibility) without your consent.

If you provide us with your consent, the Site will use Cookies for any other purposes in accordance with your preferences, including Statistics, Marketing, and Personalization. You can withdraw your consent at any time by visiting [www.jetbrains.com/opt-out/](https://www.jetbrains.com/opt-out/) or by adjusting the settings on the Cookie banner.

For how long we store the Cookies and related personal data

Cookies can be stored on the user’s device for various amounts of time. Some Cookies are activated only for a session, meaning they are activated when a user opens the browser window and deleted when they close the browser window. Other, so-called ‘persistent’ Cookies remain stored on the user’s device for an extended period of time.

In any event, any Cookies and personal data collected using Cookies will be stored and processed for no longer than 2 years.

#### Processing of personal data through Cookies

Some (but not all) Cookies make you identifiable, in which case operations with data obtained from the usage of such Cookies qualifies as the processing of personal data. To the extent this is the case, we may process the personal data because:

a) It is necessary to operate the Site (i.e., perform our contract with you) (strictly necessary Cookies).

b) You have given us consent (other Cookies).

The purposes of such processing correspond to the purposes of various types of Cookies as explained above.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by visiting [www.jetbrains.com/opt-out/](https://www.jetbrains.com/opt-out/) or by adjusting the settings on the Cookie banner.

For further information about deleting or blocking Cookies, please visit: [https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies/](https://www.aboutcookies.org/how-to-delete-cookies).

#### More about the Cookies we use

_Cookies._ There are two types of cookies:

_Persistent cookies:_ These cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.

_Session cookies:_ These cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

Cookies can be either first-party or third-party cookies. Whether a cookie is first-party or third-party depends on which domain placed the cookie.

_First-party cookies_ are those placed by a website being visited by the user at the time (for example, cookies placed by us). Cookies placed by JetBrains are used when you create an account, identify yourself using a JetBrains Account, purchase products using our e-store, or use any of our services, including (but not limited to) our issue tracker, blogs and discussions forums, signing up for our newsletter, and so on. At times we may also use Cookies to test out new features of our Website and/or web-based services with a subset of our audience.

_Third-party cookies_ are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.

_Clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other similar technologies._ Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

If you are in the EU, you may opt in and at any time opt out of certain third-party Cookies that we and other websites may use for targeting, via [https://www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/). Opting out of one or more ad networks only means that members of those particular ad networks will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other third-party websites. If your browser is configured to reject Cookies when you visit one of the aforementioned opt-out pages, and you later erase your Cookies, use a different computer, or change web browsers, your preference may no longer be active. Since all of these Cookies are managed by third parties, you should refer to the third parties' own website privacy notifications and policies for further information (see above for more information about the particular Marketing Cookies used on our Site).

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") [Consumer Choice Page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information on opting out of interest-based advertising, and available choices regarding having your information used by [DAA companies](https://www.aboutads.info/participating/). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") [Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) for information on opting out of interest-based advertising, and available choices regarding having your information used by [NAI members](https://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks).

Opting out of one or more of the companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI [Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., context-based ads). Also, note that if your browsers are configured to reject Cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/) and on the NAI's website at [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/).

#### DO NOT TRACK

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking by disabling cookies in your browser, but if you do so, we cannot guarantee the correct behavior of the services we provide to you.

#### LINKS

At times, JetBrains websites and/or JetBrains software products may contain links to other external (non-JetBrains) sites. JetBrains is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such linked websites.
