We are committed to the protection of subscriber, customer and community privacy. The Great Courses has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy and protection of your personal information. To better protect your privacy, The Great Courses provides this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used in connection with our The Great Courses service.

By using the Website, you confirm that you accept our Terms and Conditions and our use of Cookies as set out in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.wondrium.com/cookies), and that you have read and understood this Privacy Notice.  We may amend this Privacy Notice at any time.  If we make a material change to the way in which we collect, use, and/or disclose your Personal Information, we will post a notice on the Website and/or send an email to users who have provided an email address.

**Information about Us**

Our Service and Website is operated by The Teaching Company Sales, LLC, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA 20151-2299 (under the name of “The Great Courses”). If you would like information on how to contact us, click Contact Us.   “The Great Courses Plus” is the name of our subscription-based service.

**1\. What Information Is Collected**

The following are the types of information we may collect:

**Personal Information**

The Great Courses may collect personal information, which shall include but is not limited to, name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, home or business mailing address, and details regarding your mode of payment, _e.g._, credit/debit card or account information, when you access certain areas of the Website that require registration or payment for products and services, or if you require more information about those services.  
  
**Non-Personal Information**  
At other times, The Great Courses may collect information that cannot be used to directly identify you, such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, “click stream” data, and similar non-personally identifiable information.  For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.  
  
While we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic.  
  
Further, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the Websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those Websites.  
  
**Electronic Communications**  
When you open emails from us or engage in SMS or MMS communications, we may log and store such information. We may also keep records of various communications regarding the types of products and services that you indicate are of interest to you via your response to email and text messaging. You will always have the option to opt-out of such communications by clicking an “unsubscribe” link or replying “STOP” to our text messages.  
  
**  
2\. How Do We Collect Information**  
We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including, without limitation, those described below:

You will be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information.  You will be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to access your subscription, as well as to take advantage of certain features on the Website or digital messaging services, such as newsletters or contests. You will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to us and what communications you would like to receive; however, please be advised that many products and services available on the Website require registration and if you elect not to provide such information, you will not be able to take advantage of those products and services.  
  
**Contests or Sweepstakes**  
We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website and messaging services that will require registration or the submission of personal information. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used, including postings to the Website).  
  
**Surveys and Games**

We may use any number of tools to collect information about you, your computer access points, and the web browser that you use to connect to our Website. For example, “cookies” are tiny text files that we place on your computer’s hard drive when you visit our Website. We may use cookies to personalize your Website experience. You do not have to accept our cookies and you may delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive. If you do not accept or delete our cookies, some areas of our Website that you access may take more time to work, or may not function properly. For more information about cookies, visit: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

This information may include your IP address, the type of browser, the time that your browser was used to access our Website, and the referring Website address.  
  
Our Internet Service Providers (defined below) and supporting service platform providers may also use other standard web-based technologies to analyze your movements while accessing our Website. The technologies may include analytic solutions, web “beacons,” “pixel tags,” and “clear gifs.” These technologies help us ascertain the effectiveness of our product and service campaigns and marketing programs, allow us to customize the services offered on or through our Website, and help determine the best use for Website content, and product and service offerings. Some of this information, including the IP address, may be stored on our Internet service provider’s server logs, and may be available for extended periods of time.  
  
**Transaction Information**  
If you conduct a financial or other transaction with or on the Website, such as subscribe to The Great Courses or order other products/services offered on the Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information, credit card and/or other financial information. Even though the collection form may have the look and feel of thegreatcoursesplus.com, please be aware you will be giving your information to our and your authorized payment processors (such as credit card service processors or Amazon Payments) and to third party Internet Service Providers, and that in some instances the Privacy Policies of those third party Internet Service Providers will govern the collection of your personal information. Please reference the privacy policies available from these pages for any privacy related concerns.  
  
We and/or our Internet Service Providers will use this information to complete the financial or other transaction that you have requested, _i.e.,_ to deliver the information, products or other services that you request or purchase, to invoice you, and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

 The Great Courses uses the services of independent companies to provide certain services to you, including, without limitation, Website hosting services, course content distribution services, credit and debit card processing, mobile application providers, order fulfillment, contest and sweepstakes processing, and Internet connectivity services (“Internet Service Providers”) in connection with The Great Courses.  We may share your non-personal and personal information with these third parties as necessary to provide these services to you.  
  
We use your personal information to send you order confirmations. In such cases, you should receive via e-mail an order confirmation after placing your order.  You may also receive confirmation e-mails from your designated payment processor.  Occasionally, you will receive articles of interest on the subjects covered by our courses. From time-to-time you may receive e-mail surveys to vote for The Great Courses you want us to make, to rate the quality of The Great Courses Service or individual course titles, and to tell us what improvements to make to The Great Courses and our services. We may also use your personal information to notify you of special offers. You may receive e-mails notifying you when individual courses featured in our print catalogs and newsletters go on sale. These e-mails also make ordering extremely simple—if you see courses that interest you, simply click on the links in the e-mail to find out more.  
  
We may also use your IP address to help protect us and our Internet Service Providers from fraud. Additional uses of your non-personal and personal information will allow us to tailor products and services specific to your needs, to help organize and manage your customer relationship and our business, to conduct business, to provide you with customer and member support, to perform functions that are described to you at the time of collection, and to enforce our Website’s Terms of Use.  
  
We may also use non-personal aggregate information to improve our Website. For example, our Internet Service Providers may report to us that there were a particular number of visitors to a certain area of our Website, or that a certain number of men or a certain number of women completed our registration form in particular areas of our Website. Such information may also be used to analyze the effectiveness of our business and advertising models.  
  
**4\. Shared Information**  
We may share your personal information with the Internet Service Providers as appropriate.  We may also share personally identifiable information with outside, non-affiliated third parties that offer products and services that are complementary to our product lines. We may also disclose your personal information as is necessary to: (a) comply with a subpoena or court order; (b) cooperate with law enforcement or other government agency; (c) establish or exercise our legal rights; (d) protect the property or safety of our company and employees, contractors, vendors, and suppliers; (e) defend against legal claims; (f) help with internal and external investigations; or (g) as otherwise required by law or permitted by law.

We use third-party ad serving, analytics, and audience and traffic measurement services.   We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Website or the use of our Services. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in.  Audience and traffic measurement services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from the Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the Website cookies, the Website's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third-party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third-party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Other companies' uses of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout\_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third-party ad servers we may use. We utilize the analysis services of Crazy Egg on our Website, click [here](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy) to view its privacy policy and [here](https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out) to view its opt out feature. Additionally, Crazy Egg [terms and conditions](https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out) regarding your activity and content on this Website, its disclaimer of liability, arbitration and dispute resolution apply to this Website, and Crazy Egg is a third party beneficiary of such provisions.  
  
With regard to name and postal address only, from time to time, we may make our mailing list available to carefully screened companies. If you prefer we don’t share your name and postal address, please call our Customer Care team at 1-800-832-2412 or write to us at The Great Courses, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA, 20151-2299, Attn: Customer Care.
