You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (“Payment Method”) as such may be updated from time to time, to use the TGC Plus Service. We will bill the quarterly membership fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your membership before it renews each quarter in order to avoid billing of the next 3 month’s Subscription fees to your Payment Method.

**Semi-Annual Memberships**. Your TGC Plus Semi-Annual Membership, which may start with a free trial, will continue every 6 months unless and until you affirmatively cancel your membership, or we terminate it. You must have internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted Payment Method as such may be updated from time to time to use the TGC Plus Service. We will bill the semi-annual membership fee to your Payment Method.

We will bill the annual Membership fee to your Payment Method, and will bill renewal term invoices to your Payment Method prior to the expiration of your current Membership term.

Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your membership with TGC Plus by visiting the Site and clicking on the "My Account" page link. Some promotional memberships are offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.

 b**.    Free Trials**    

      i.         Your TGC Plus Subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your Subscription is specified during sign-up. Access to a free trial Subscription will terminate at the end of the free trial period, provided that you cancel during the free trial period. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new Subscribers only. Some TGC Plus Subscriber benefits may not be available to persons enjoying free trial service.  TGC Plus reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.   

     ii.         We will begin billing your Payment Method for Subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your Subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your Subscription, including your Subscription price and end date of your free trial period, visit the Site, log in to the site, and visit your My Account page. We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to one billing period of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period.    

     iii.         YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A NOTICE FROM US THAT YOUR FREE TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT THE PAYING PORTION OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN. YOU AGREE THAT WE CAN AND WILL BILL YOUR PAYMENT METHOD AND WILL RENEW YOUR MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, SEMI-ANNUAL OR ANNUAL SUBCRIPTION SERVICES UNLESS YOU CANCEL PRIOR TO YOUR MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, SEMI-ANNUAL, OR ANNUAL AUTO-RENEWAL DATE. WE WILL NOTIFY YOU OF YOUR UPCOMING RENEWAL, PRIOR TO BILLING YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE UPCOMING RENEWAL, IF YOU HAVE A QUARTERLY, SEMI-ANNUAL OR ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. IF YOU HAVE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY MONTHLY NOTIFICATION PRIOR TO BILLING YOUR PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE NEXT MONTH. CLICK YOUR LOGIN LINK AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THIS SITE (www.thegreatcoursesplus.com) AND SELECT “MY ACCOUNT” TO FIND CANCELLATION INSTRUCTIONS.

 **c.     Billing**

     i.        **Recurring Billing**. By starting your TGC Plus Subscription and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual Subscription fee at the then current Subscription rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the TGC Plus Service. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month, each quarter, half yearly, or each year (as applicable), may vary from period to period for reasons that may include differing amounts due to applicable taxes, promotional offers, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly or in one or more charges.

     ii.        **Price Changes**. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your Service will take effect following email notice to you.

     iii.        **Taxes**. Applicable sales taxes are NOT included in advertised prices for the TGC Plus Service, and will be applied as applicable in those states and countries where taxes apply to your Subscription.

     iv.        **Billing Cycle**. The Subscription fee for our TGC Plus Service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your Subscription and each month, each quarter, each 6 months or each year thereafter (as applicable) unless and until you cancel your Subscription. Click the login link at the top right of this Site (www.thegreatcoursesplus.com) and select "My Account" to find cancellation instructions. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying Subscription. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your TGC Plus monthly Subscription or became a paying Subscriber on March 31st, your next monthly payment date is likely to be April 30th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription. Visit our website and go to your My Account page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period and your “Next Billing Date”. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of Subscription or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly, quarter or quarterly, semi-annual or semi-annually, or annual or annually refers to your applicable billing cycle.

     v.        **No Refunds**. EXCEPT WHERE WE MAY TERMINATE THE SERVICE UNDER SECTION 22 OF THESE TERMS OF USE. PAYMENTS FOR TGC PLUS SERVICE ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS.  THE GREAT COURSE’S “LIFETIME SATISFACTION GUARANTEE” PROGRAM FOR THE GREAT COURSE’S PRODUCTS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE TGCPLUS SERVICE.   Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our Subscribers ("credits"). The amount and form of such refund, discount, or other credit, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of a refund, discount, or other credit in one instance does not entitle you to a refund, discount, or other credit in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide any refund, discount, or other credit in the future, under any circumstance.

     vi.        **Payment Methods**. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting your My Account page, available at the top of the TGC Plus website after you log in. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

     vii.        **Cancellation**. You may cancel your TGC Plus Subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the TGC Plus Service through the end of your monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual billing period, as applicable. EXCEPT WHERE WE MAY TERMINATE THE SERVICE UNDER SECTION 22 OF THESE THERMS OF USE, WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION BILLING PERIOD OR FOR UNWATCHED CONTENT. To cancel, go to your My Account page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your Subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period or at the end of the free trial period, whichever is applicable. To see when your account will close, view your My Account page. If you signed up for TGC Plus using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, and wish to cancel your TGC Plus Subscription at any time, including during your free trial, you may need to do so through such third party, including by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the TGC Plus Service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your TGC Plus Subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

We reserve the right in our sole and absolute discretion to make changes from time to time and without notice in how we offer and operate our Service.

You agree not to archive, download, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use (except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use) full course content, video or audio clips, images, screen grabs or information contained on or obtained from or through the TGC Plus Service without express written permission from TGC Plus. You also agree not to: circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the TGC Plus Service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the TGC Plus Service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the TGC Plus Service; insert any code or product or manipulate the content of the TGC Plus Service in any way; or, use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method. In addition, you agree not to upload, post, e-mail or otherwise send or transmit any material designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment associated with the TGC Plus Service, including any software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs.

g.    The availability of TGC Plus Service course titles and TGC Plus content will change from time to time, and may vary from country to country. Some, but not all, TGC Plus Service content will be available in HD, and HD service availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities.  The quality of the display of the streaming aspects of the Service may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. You are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. TGC Plus makes no representations or warranties about the quality of your watching experience on your display. The time it takes to begin watching a course lecture will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, course or lecture you have selected and the configuration of your viewing device.

h.    TGC Plus Service software is developed by, or licensed for, TGC Plus and is designed to enable streaming of content from TGC Plus through appropriate devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities may also differ between devices. BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE LICENSE AGREEMENT TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT AND TO RECEIVE, WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE OR PROMPTING, UPDATED VERSIONS OF TGC PLUS SERVICE SOFTWARE AND RELATED THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE FOREGOING TERMS, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICE. WE DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR OTHERWISE WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE DEVICES, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY OF THE DEVICE WITH OUR SERVICE. By using our Service, you agree to look solely to the entity that manufactured and/or sold you the device for any issues related to the device and its compatibility with the TGC Plus Service. If the device you used to access your TGC Plus Service is sold, lost or stolen, please deactivate the device.

To deactivate a device, follow instructions on your My Account page on our website.   We may terminate or restrict your use of our Service, without compensation or notice if you are, or if we suspect that you are (i) in violation of any of these Terms of Use or (ii) engaged in illegal or improper use of the Service.

**7\.    Passwords & Account Access**

 a.     The Subscriber who created the TGC Plus Service account and whose Payment Method is charged is referred to in these Terms of Use as the Subscriber. The Subscriber has access and control over his or her TGC Plus Service account. The Subscriber's control is exercised through use of the Subscriber's password and therefore to maintain exclusive control, the Subscriber should not reveal the password to anyone. In addition, if the Subscriber wishes to prohibit others from contacting TGC Plus Customer Service and potentially altering the Subscriber's control, the Subscriber should not reveal the Payment Method details (e.g., last four digits of their credit or debit card, or their email address and password if they use Amazon Payments) associated with their account. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account.

b.    In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the TGC Plus Service, TGC implements technology that enables us to recognize you as the Subscriber and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the TGC Plus Service, which includes accessing via TGC Plus Service-ready devices or the TGC Plus Service website.

c.     TGC or its payment processors reserve the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the Subscriber in order to protect itself and its vendors from what it believes to be fraudulent activity or violations of these terms. TGC is not obligated to credit or discount a Subscription for holds placed on the account by either a TGC representative or by the TGC automated processes.

**8\.    Use of Information Submitted**. TGC is free to use any comments, information, ideas, concepts, reviews, or techniques or any other material contained in any communication you may send to us, including responses to questionnaires or through postings to the TGC Plus Service website and user interfaces, worldwide and in perpetuity without further compensation, acknowledgement or payment to you for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and creating, modifying or improving the TGC Plus Service or specific TGC Plus courses.  TGC is free to use any suggestions or unsolicited materials or ideas for courses without compensation of any type, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to TGC. Should you send any unsolicited materials or ideas, you do so with the understanding that no additional consideration of any sort will be provided to you, and you are waiving any claim against TGC and its affiliates regarding the use of such materials and ideas, even if material or an idea is used that is the same or substantially similar to the material or idea you sent.

a.     We permit you to post or send to us comments, information, ideas, concepts, reviews, or techniques and other material relating to TGC Plus and our Products and Services (each a “Response”).

b.    You are not permitted to post Responses that contain: harsh, profane or discriminatory language; illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory or otherwise objectionable content; URLs, phone numbers, mailing or e-mail addresses, other personal information; misleading information regarding the origin of the Response; or a discussion of the Company’s policies or services. We do not regularly review the Responses posted on our Site.  However, we reserve the right to reject, remove or edit any such Responses at any time without notice to you. You understand and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, review Responses and may delete or remove them (without notice to you) in our sole and absolute discretion, for any reason or no reason. In addition, we may use Responses for the purposes set forth under the “Use of Responses: License Grant” section below.

We are constantly making adjustments to Streaming Service and often these adjustments are not completely captured within these Terms of Use.

a. Availability of Streaming Service:

The availability and quality of Streaming Service will change from time to time, and from country to country. The quality of Streaming Services may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and country to country, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your internet connection.

The Company makes no representations or warranties about the quality of Streaming Service.

Streaming Service may be unavailable to you from time to time in connection with maintenance or for other technical or non-technical reasons, and, as a result, without prior notice to you, the TGC Plus Service ordinarily available via Streaming Service may be temporarily unavailable.

Some, but not all, of our TGC Plus content delivered through our Streaming Service will be in HD.  HD service availability is subject to your internet service and device capabilities.

b.  Initiation of Streaming Service:

The amount of time it takes to initiate Streaming Service on a device will vary based on a number of factors, including your country, your location, available bandwidth at the time, the particular Product or Service you have selected and the configuration of your device.

     (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

     (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

     (vi) The following statement: “The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”

     A. We will remove or disable access to the content that is alleged to be infringing;

     B. We will forward the written notification to the alleged infringer; and

Upon the copyright agent’s receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information as outlined in (i) through (iv) above, the DMCA provides that the removed material will be restored or access re-enabled and we will comply with this requirement as required by law, provided that the designated agent has not received notice from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our network.

**20\.  Severability**

This means that if the prohibition against class or collective actions is found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief and any appeals have been exhausted (or if the decision is otherwise final), then such claim or request for relief shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction, but it shall be stayed pending arbitration of all other claims and requests for relief.**

**22\.  Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration Agreement** 

**Please Read the Following Provisions in this Section 22 Carefully – It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court** 

a.  Applicability. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including its formation, performance and breach) and the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  Subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 22, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.  The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms of Use shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.   

**The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  The parties further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.** 

**b.  Informal Disputes Resolution**. Both the Company and the Subscriber shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You and we agree to personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference in a good faith effort to resolve informally any dispute prior to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference, as will at least one of our corporate representatives. The party initiating a dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party sends a Notice, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases; unless all parties agree, multiple individuals initiating a dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference. If we have a dispute with you, we will send Notice to your billing address and/or email address you have provided to us. If you have a dispute with us, you will send Notice to us in writing at the following email and physical address: [legal@teachco.com](mailto:legal@teachco.com), or 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA  20151, Attn:  Legal Department using the subject line “Informal Dispute Resolution Conference.” Your Notice must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, email address, and your residential address. The Notice also must describe the dispute, explain the facts of the dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. A Notice will not be valid, will not commence the time period for the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a mandatory condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant Notice, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it participated in an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference after sending Notice as required by this paragraph. If either party violates this Initial Dispute Resolution paragraph, a court of competent jurisdiction has the authority to enjoin the prosecution of the arbitration or court proceeding, and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration provider shall neither accept nor administer any such arbitration nor assess fees in connection with such arbitration. The statute of limitations and all filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this paragraph.

**c. Class Action Waiver.** The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

**d.  Exceptions.**

i.  Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims or enforcement actions.  Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction to the extent such claims do not seek equitable relief.

ii. Intellectual Property, Trade Secrets, and Moral Rights. Either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).   

iii. Mass Arbitration. 

* Mass Arbitration Defined. If 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall be administered by NAM, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “NAM Rules”), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The NAM Rules are available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with NAM, you and we agree to contact NAM jointly to advise that the parties intend to use NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on NAM’s claim form(s) and as directed by NAM. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from NAM compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed.    
* Appointment of Procedural Arbitrator. You and we agree to cooperate in good faith to implement the Mass Arbitration process to minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Those steps include, but are not limited to (1) the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator to implement agreements by the parties to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the Mass Arbitration and to rule on proposals by the parties for the efficient and cost-effective management of the Mass Arbitration to the extent the parties cannot agree; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar for the arbitration proceedings. 

**e.  Thirty Day Right to Opt Out**. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 22 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: The Teaching Company Sales, LLC, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA  20151, Attn:  Legal Dept./Arbitration Opt-Out.  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the date you have agreed to the Terms of Use, whether based on your initial use of the Site or Subscription Service your continued use after the effective date of these Terms of Use;  otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms set forth above.  If you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we may terminate your use of the Service.  If we terminate your use of the Service, we will provide you with a pro-rata refund of any fees you have already paid for the applicable subscription period, and which have not been used in connection with the Service.

    **C. Billing**   

          **i. Recurring Billing.**  By starting your TGC Plus Subscription and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorise us to charge you a monthly or annual (or other applicable period) Subscription fee at the then current Subscription rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the TGC Plus Service. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month, or each year (as applicable), may vary from month to month (or year to year) for reasons that may include differing amounts due to applicable taxes, promotional offers, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorise us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly, annually or other applicable period in one or more charges. 

          **ii. Price Changes.**  We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your Service will take effect no earlier than 30 days following email notice to you. 

* Applicable sales/service or value added taxes are included in advertised prices for the TGC Plus Service, and will be applied as applicable in those provinces, states and countries where taxes apply to your Subscription. 

          **iii.  Billing Cycle.**  The Subscription fee for our TGC Plus Service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your Subscription and each month, each quarter or year thereafter (as applicable) unless and until you cancel your Subscription. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month, each quarter or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying Subscription. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your TGC Plus monthly Subscription or became a paying Subscriber on March 31st, your next payment date is likely to be April 30th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription. Visit the Site and click on the link to the “My Account” page Billing Information section to see the commencement date for your next renewal period and your “Next Billing Date”. We may authorise your Payment Method in anticipation of Subscription or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly refers to your billing cycle. 

           **iv.**  **No Refunds.** PAYMENTS FOR THE GREAT COURSES PLUS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS.  THE COMPANY’S “LIFETIME SATISFACTION GUARANTEE” PROGRAM FOR ITS NON-SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE TGC PLUS SERVICE.   Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our Subscribers ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance. 

           **v. Payment.**  You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our Site and clicking on the “My Account " page link. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorise us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details. We may also cancel or suspend your access to the TGC Plus Service if you do not pay us as required by your subscription terms.   

    **D. Cancellation.** You may cancel your TGC Plus Subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the TGC Plus Service through the end of your monthly, quarterly, or annual billing period, as applicable.

At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our Subscribers ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.

Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

The quality of Streaming Services may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and country to country, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your internet connection.

     iii.        **Taxes**. Applicable sales taxes are NOT included in advertised prices for the TGC Plus Service, and will be applied as applicable in those states and countries where taxes apply to your Subscription.

     iv.        **Billing Cycle**. The Subscription fee for our TGC Plus Service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your Subscription and each month, each quarter, each 6 months or each year thereafter (as applicable) unless and until you cancel your Subscription. Click the login link at the top right of this Site (www.TGC Plus.com) and select "My Account" to find cancellation instructions. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying Subscription. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your TGC Plus monthly Subscription or became a paying Subscriber on March 31st, your next monthly payment date is likely to be April 30th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription. Visit our website and go to your My Account page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period and your “Next Billing Date”. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of Subscription or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly, quarter or quarterly, semi-annual or semi-annually, or annual or annually refers to your applicable billing cycle.

     v.        **No Refunds**. EXCEPT WHERE WE MAY TERMINATE THE SERVICE UNDER SECTION 22 OF THESE TERMS OF USE. PAYMENTS FOR TGC PLUS SERVICE ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS.  THE GREAT COURSE’S “LIFETIME SATISFACTION GUARANTEE” PROGRAM FOR THE GREAT COURSE’S PRODUCTS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE TGC PLUS SERVICE.   Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our Subscribers ("credits"). The amount and form of such refund, discount, or other credit, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of a refund, discount, or other credit in one instance does not entitle you to a refund, discount, or other credit in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide any refund, discount, or other credit in the future, under any circumstance.

     vi.        **Payment Methods**. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting your My Account page, available at the top of the TGC Plus website after you log in. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

     vii.        **Cancellation**. You may cancel your TGC Plus Subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the TGC Plus Service through the end of your monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual billing period, as applicable. EXCEPT WHERE WE MAY TERMINATE THE SERVICE UNDER SECTION 22 OF THESE THERMS OF USE, WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION BILLING PERIOD OR FOR UNWATCHED CONTENT. To cancel, go to your My Account page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your Subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period or at the end of the free trial period, whichever is applicable. To see when your account will close, view your My Account page. If you signed up for TGC Plus using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, and wish to cancel your TGC Plus Subscription at any time, including during your free trial, you may need to do so through such third party, including by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the TGC Plus Service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your TGC Plus Subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

**7\.    Passwords & Account Access**

 a.     The Subscriber who created the TGC Plus Service account and whose Payment Method is charged is referred to in these Terms of Use as the Subscriber. The Subscriber has access and control over his or her TGC Plus Service account. The Subscriber's control is exercised through use of the Subscriber's password and therefore to maintain exclusive control, the Subscriber should not reveal the password to anyone. In addition, if the Subscriber wishes to prohibit others from contacting TGC Plus Customer Service and potentially altering the Subscriber's control, the Subscriber should not reveal the Payment Method details (e.g., last four digits of their credit or debit card, or their email address and password if they use Amazon Payments) associated with their account.

c.     TGC or its payment processors reserve the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the Subscriber in order to protect itself and its vendors from what it believes to be fraudulent activity or violations of these terms. TGC is not obligated to credit or discount a Subscription for holds placed on the account by either a TGC representative or by the TGC automated processes.

b.  Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its parent,, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of TGC Plus Service; (ii) your use of and access to the Site; (iii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Use; (iv) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, property, or privacy right; or (v) any claim that any Response submitted by you causes damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will continue during and after your Subscription Term and will survive your use of TGC Plus Service and this Site.

**18\. Transfer of Rights and Obligations**

These Terms of Use are binding on you and the Company and on our respective successors and assigns.

You may not transfer, assign, change, or otherwise dispose of these Terms of Use, or any of your rights or obligations arising under them, without our prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, charge, sub-contract or otherwise dispose of these Terms of Use, or any of our rights or obligations arising under them, at any time.

**19\. Waiver** 

If we fail, at any time to insist upon strict performance of any of your obligations under our agreement with you or any of these Terms of Use, or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which we are entitled under these Terms of Use, this shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and shall not relieve you from compliance with such obligations. A waiver by us of any default shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default.

No waiver by us of any of these Terms of Use shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing.

**20\.  Severability** 

If any of these Terms of Use or any provisions of our agreement(s) with you are determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition, or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions, and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law. **The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or collective actions as provided for below. This means that if the prohibition against class or collective actions is found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief and any appeals have been exhausted (or if the decision is otherwise final), then such claim or request for relief shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction, but it shall be stayed pending arbitration of all other claims and requests for relief.**

**22\.  Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration Agreement** 

**Please Read the Following Provisions in this Section 22 Carefully – It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court** 

a.  Applicability. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including its formation, performance and breach) and the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  Subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 22, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.  The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms of Use shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.   

**The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.  The parties further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.** 

**b.  Informal Disputes Resolution**. Both the Company and the Subscriber shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You and we agree to personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference in a good faith effort to resolve informally any dispute prior to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference, as will at least one of our corporate representatives. The party initiating a dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party sends a Notice, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases; unless all parties agree, multiple individuals initiating a dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference. If we have a dispute with you, we will send Notice to your billing address and/or email address you have provided to us. If you have a dispute with us, you will send Notice to us in writing at the following email and physical address: [legal@teachco.com](mailto:legal@teachco.com), or 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA   20151, Attn:  Legal Department using the subject line “Informal Dispute Resolution Conference.” Your Notice must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, email address, and your residential address. The Notice also must describe the dispute, explain the facts of the dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. A Notice will not be valid, will not commence the time period for the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a mandatory condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant Notice, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it participated in an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference after sending Notice as required by this paragraph. If either party violates this Initial Dispute Resolution paragraph, a court of competent jurisdiction has the authority to enjoin the prosecution of the arbitration or court proceeding, and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration provider shall neither accept nor administer any such arbitration nor assess fees in connection with such arbitration. The statute of limitations and all filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this paragraph.

**c. Class Action Waiver.** The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

**d.  Exceptions.**

i.  Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims or enforcement actions.  Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction to the extent such claims do not seek equitable relief. 

ii. Intellectual Property, Trade Secrets, and Moral Rights. Either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).   

iii. Mass Arbitration. 

* Mass Arbitration Defined. If 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall be administered by NAM, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “NAM Rules”), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The NAM Rules are available at https://namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with NAM, you and we agree to contact NAM jointly to advise that the parties intend to use NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on NAM’s claim form(s) and as directed by NAM. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from NAM compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed.    
* Appointment of Procedural Arbitrator. You and we agree to cooperate in good faith to implement the Mass Arbitration process to minimize the time and costs of arbitration. Those steps include, but are not limited to (1) the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator to implement agreements by the parties to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the Mass Arbitration and to rule on proposals by the parties for the efficient and cost-effective management of the Mass Arbitration to the extent the parties cannot agree; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar for the arbitration proceedings. 

**e.  Thirty Day Right to Opt Out**. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 22 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: The Teaching Company Sales, LLC, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400, Chantilly, VA  20151, Attn:  Legal Dept./Arbitration Opt-Out.  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the date you have agreed to the Terms of Use, whether based on your initial use of the Site or Subscription Service your continued use after the effective date of these Terms of Use; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms set forth above.  If you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we may terminate your use of the Service.  If we terminate your use of the Service, we will provide you with a pro-rata refund of any fees you have already paid for the applicable subscription period, and which have not been used in connection with the Service.

Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, users located in California are entitled to the following consumer rights notice: If a user has a question or complaint regarding the Service, please send an email to contactus@thegreatcoursesplus.com. Users may also contact us by writing to The Teaching Company, LLC dba TGC Plus, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 400 Chantilly, VA   21051.

**24\.  Entire Agreement**

These Terms of Use and any document expressly referred to in them represent the entire agreement between us in relation to the subject matter and supersede any prior agreement, understanding, or arrangement between us, whether oral or in writing.
