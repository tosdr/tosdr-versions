### 7\. Account Termination Policy

Motorsport.tv may terminate a user's access to the Motorsport.tv Platform without prior notice if Motorsport.tv determines that the user has acted in contravention of these Terms of Service.

### 8\. Payments, Billing; Subscriptions

1. Subscriptions and other services requiring payment generally require use of a valid credit card. Motorsport.tv and its business partners reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to establish other acceptable alternative payment methods for specific services or products. You are solely responsible for charges owed for all goods and services purchased through this site, including, but not limited to, applicable taxes, shipping charges, insurance, and any other costs.
2. While Motorsport.tv may offer Content from time to time for free, Motorsport.tv charges a fee to access the Motorsport.tv services that require a subscription in order to offer Content that Motorsport.tv would not otherwise be able to make available without charging a fee.
3. You can find the specific details regarding your subscription at any time by logging in on the Motorsport.tv Platform and clicking on Account under your name. You agree that your subscription is for individual use only and your subscription is limited to only one simultaneous stream at a time.
4. Because the Service is offered in multiple time zones, for consistency, a “day” for purposes of these TOS begins at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time and ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time of that same calendar day.
5. Billing. By providing a credit card or other payment method accepted by Motorsport.tv (“Payment Method”) for your subscription, you are expressly agreeing that Motorsport.tv is authorized to charge you a subscription fee, any other fees for additional services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of your subscription to the Payment Method. If you want to use a different Payment Method than the one you signed up to use during registration, or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information by logging in on the Motorsport.tv Platform and clicking on Account under your name. When you provide a Payment Method to access a subscription, including in connection with a free trial offer (if applicable), our system will attempt to verify the information you entered. Motorsport.tv does this by processing an authorization hold, which is a standard practice. Motorsport.tv does not charge you in connection with this authorization hold. If your Payment Method expires and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account, you authorize Motorsport.tv to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
6. As used in these TOS “billing” shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription or expiration of your free trial period, if any, whichever is earlier, and on each renewal date thereafter (monthly or annually as applicable) unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these TOS. To see the commencement date for your next renewal period, log in on the applicable Motorsport.tv Platform and click on Account under your name.
7. Motorsport.tv automatically bills your Payment Method each month or year (depending on the subscription) on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your subscription. As in the case with monthly subscriptions, in the event your subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month. For example, if you became a paying subscriber on January 31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28. If you change your Payment Method, this could result in changing the calendar day upon which you are billed. You acknowledge that the amount billed each monthly or annual period may vary due to promotional offers, changes in your subscription, and changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize Motorsport.tv to charge your Payment Method for the corresponding amounts. If Motorsport.tv changes the subscription fee or other charges for your subscription, Motorsport.tv will give you advance notice of these changes by email. However, Motorsport.tv will not be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes.
8. Very rarely, if there are special circumstances where Motorsport.tv determines it is appropriate (e.g., your subscription service is unavailable for days due to technical difficulties), Motorsport.tv may provide credits to affected subscribers. The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at Motorsport.tv’s sole and absolute discretion, and the provision of credits in one instance does not entitle anyone to credits in the future under similar or different circumstances.
9. Ongoing Subscription and Cancellation. Your subscription will continue in effect on a month-to-month or annual basis (depending on subscription selected) unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account or Service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these TOS. You must cancel your subscription at least twenty-four hours before your monthly or annual renewal date in order to avoid the next billing period. Motorsport.tv will bill the monthly or annual subscription fee plus any applicable taxes to the Payment Method you provide to Motorsport.tv during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period or annual period – this means that you will have continued access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund. You can cancel your subscription by logging into your Account either on a Motorsport.tv Platform or the third party website hosting your Account and subscription (as applicable, e.g., iTunes, Google Play, etc.) and clicking “Cancel Subscription” or any other similarly identifiable selection to effectively cancel the subscription.
10. Unpaid Amounts. It is important that each subscriber honor the payment obligations to which the subscriber agreed. Accordingly, Motorsport.tv reserves the right to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your subscription. You will remain liable for all such amounts and all costs incurred in connection with the collection of these amounts, including, without limitation, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and arbitration or court costs.

### 9\. Digital Millennium Copyright Act

1. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing Motorsport.tv's copyright department with the following information in writing:
    * A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
    * Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

    * A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    * A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
    * Notifications of claimed infringement should be emailed to copyright@motorsport.com. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 8(A), your DMCA notice may not be valid.
2. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your user Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your user Submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
    * Your physical or electronic signature;
    * Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
    * A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
    * Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Miami, Florida, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
    * If a counter-notice is received by Motorsport.tv copyright department, Motorsport.tv may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Motorsport.tv's sole discretion.
