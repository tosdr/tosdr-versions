This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on our websites, software, mobile applications, and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites and other offerings are collectively called “**Services.**”

**PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect personal information both from our user customers (“**Users**”), as well as from our expert coaches and content creators (“**Creators**”) who provide personalized online training (“**Coaching Services**”) as well as other. The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our Services, and the requirements of applicable law. We collect information that you provide to us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and information from other sources such as third-party services and organizations, as described below.

**A. Information You Provide to Us Directly**

We may collect the following personal information that you provide to us.

    Twitch, Apple,

If you choose to link your Account to an account you have with a third-party video game provider (such as your Riot account), we may import user data from your third-party game account and public APIs to display additional statistics in your Account profile page, and correlate that data on our own backend with other data you provide through our Services (as described below).
    
* **Creators (Coaches)**
    
    : We may collect your email address, name, signature, link to social channels, supported games, payment information, photo, links to your prior coaching or other game-related content, your desired coaching rate, and other information about your interests and expert qualifications.

All of these Coaching Services may require both Creators and Users to provide additional personal information to us, which we will collect and store as part of your Account and use to determine whether the Coaching Services have been delivered as promised.

    . Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.
    
* **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons**
    
    . A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

To the extent that such sharing is considered a “sale” under the CCPA, you may opt-out of having your information shared by disabling third-party cookies on your device, or by contacting us as set forth in “Contact Us” below.

**Additional Privacy Rights for California Residents**

**Non-Discrimination.** California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of their rights conferred by the CCPA.

**Authorized Agent.** Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as set forth in “Contact Us” below and provide written authorization signed by you and your designated agent.

**Verification**. To protect your privacy, we will take steps the following steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. When you make a request, we will ask you to provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include asking you to answer questions regarding your Account and use of our Services.

If you are a California resident and would like to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, please contact us as set forth in “Contact Us” below. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws. 

**Refer-a-Friend and Similar Incentive Programs.** As described above in **How We Use Your Personal Information** (“Share Content with Friends or Colleagues”), we may offer referral programs or other incentivized data collection programs. For example, we may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide your personal information in exchange for a reward, or provide personal information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a User and/or Creator and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.

**Accessibility**. This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1**.** If you wish to print this policy, please do so from your web browser or by saving the page as a PDF.

**Right for minors to remove posted content.** Where required by law, California residents under the age of 18 may request to have their posted content or information removed from the publicly-viewable portions of the Services by contacting us directly as set forth in “Contact Us” below.

**SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR VIRGINIA, COLORADO AND CONNECTICUT RESIDENTS**

 The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“**VCDPA**”), the Colorado Privacy Act (“**CPA**”) and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“**CTDPA**”) provide residents of Virginia, Colorado and Connecticut with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes the rights of consumers who are residents of Virginia, Colorado and Connecticut and explains how to exercise those rights.

**Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights.** You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information. Before we disclose information to you, we will ask you for information to verify your identity. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you whether we process your personal information and provide you with access to your personal information. We will provide a copy of personal information we have obtained about you in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format. Please note that we may not disclose the information you have requested if we are unable to verify your identity. In addition, we may not disclose certain information that is covered by one or more exemptions, as outlined in the VCDPA, CPA and CTDPA.

**Deletion Request Rights.** You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we collected and retained. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. If we deny your deletion request, we will inform you and explain the basis for our denial.

You must describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

As noted earlier in this Privacy Policy, we respond only to requests that are verifiable consumer requests. Therefore, when you submit a request to us, we will seek to verify your identity by asking you to provide us with information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address. We also may use a third-party verification provider to verify your identity. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
