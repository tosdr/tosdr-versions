We reserve the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do so, we will provide notice to you by posting it on our website and in our mobile applications, and indicating the date it was modified. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Privacy Policy periodically to familiarize yourself with any modifications. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please reach out to us anytime at[privacy@sayweee.com](http://mailto:privacy@sayweee.com/) or as described in the "Contacting Us" section below.

**Section 2. Information We Collect**

Weee! collects personal information when you interact with our Services. Personal information is any information that identifies or makes an individual identifiable. The definition of personal information (used interchangeably in this Privacy Policy with the term "personal data") depends on the applicable law based on your physical location. Only the definition that applies to your physical location will apply to you under this Privacy Policy. The types of personal information that we may collect about you include, but are not limited to: information you provide to us, information collected automatically about your use of our Services, and information from third parties.

This includes:

* **Account Registration.** We collect basic account information such as your email address, phone number, username and password. We need this information to create your account and it helps secure and provide access to our Services. We also obtain or infer demographic information, as well as profile photos if you choose to upload one. If you use Facebook or another service such as Google or WeChat to register for or log in to the Services (or later connect your accounts), you authorize Facebook or the other service, as the case may be, to share your personal information with us, including your email address, age and publicly available information about you and your Facebook friends, if you use Facebook for registering for the Services. Please note that when you access our Services through social media channels or when you connect our Services to social media services, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
* **Form Submissions and Newsletter Signups.** We collect information that you provide by filling in forms that we make available. This includes when making purchases from our Services or requesting information or assistance. We also collect information relating to our newsletter subscription page, including name and email address. In addition, we collect the email address of others if you refer a friend as part of our Weeebates referral. Please have permission in order to share their information with us.
    
* **Program Participation and Promotions.** We collect information related to your participation in our programs, including our Weee! VIP program, our registered affiliate program, or promotions or surveys.
    
* **Services Usage.** We gather information from the actions you take to recommend, create, communicate and share content. This includes messages you send, posts you create yourself, and the products you mark as favorites or share. In addition, we track social interactions in our Apps (e.g. what you bought, what you loved, and your posts and invites).
    
* **Customer Service and Technical Support.** If you send us support requests or comments you may also provide us with additional information to enable us to contact you and address your feedback, and we may retain such information to enhance our Services and to respond to you.
    
* **Payment Information.** When you purchase products or services from Weee!, you provide our payment processor with your payment information. We currently use third parties to process such payments but may change that in the future.
    
* **Job Applications.** We collect employment- and background-related information provided to us as a part of the job application process.
    
* **Device Permissions.** We collect information relating to your use of features of our Services that may ask you to grant us access to location information, photos, microphone, video camera, or media on your computer or mobile device.
    

We also collect information automatically as you navigate and interact with our Services. For instance, when you browse our Site, our systems automatically collect information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of your request. Likewise, if you access the Services through a mobile device (e.g., a smart phone or tablet), we may be able to identify the general location of your mobile device, your mobile device's brand, model, operating system, resolution, screen size, system version, mobile network information, and your mobile device's advertising ID.

**Section 3. How We Use Your Information**

Weee! will only use your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you prior to such processing taking place. The purposes for which we may use your personal information include:

* **Service Providers.** We may employ other companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, provide services on our behalf, perform service-related business activities, or assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These service providers provide us support services such as credit card processing, payment gateways, website hosting, online store platforms, customer relationship management, order fulfillment and shipping, email and postal delivery, analytics, surveys, and marketing services. The service providers have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
    
* **Corporate Transactions.** We may disclose personal information to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our Services users is among the assets transferred. You agree to and do hereby consent to our assignment or transfer of rights to your personal information.

* **With Your Consent.** We may disclose your personal information for any purpose with your consent.
    

Please note that we may disclose, without restriction, aggregated or anonymized information about the users of our Services, which is information that does not identify any specific individual.

**Section 5. Information for California Residents**

This section applies solely to individuals who reside in the State of California. If you are a California resident, you are entitled to request notice of certain information about the user information that we may share with third parties for marketing purposes (e.g., the categories of user information shared, and contact information of applicable third parties), as well as request that we disclose to you what personal information we collect, use, disclose and sell about you, and the right to request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain about you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please mail your written request to Weee! at the physical address below and title your request as follows or in a similar manner: "CCPA – California Resident Request". You also have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information (as defined by applicable law), which you may exercise by clicking [Do Not Sell My Info](https://sayweee-privacy.my.onetrust.com/webform/5a6677ea-9f57-4a90-bb1f-f77090ae6a03/ae32fcd4-b2bd-4588-a65f-99539c312936), and to not be treated in a discriminatory manner for having exercised your rights regarding your privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

As described above, our Services collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device. In particular, if we acknowledge collection of information below, the Services have collected the following categories of personal information from our consumers within the last twelve (12) months.

**Sale of Personal Information Under the CCPA.** In the preceding twelve months we have not sold your personal information, as that term is generally understood, but we recognize that the CCPA defines "personal information" in such a way that making available identifiers linked to you for a benefit may be considered a "sale."

In addition to the "Use of Cookies" section's description for opting out of interest-based advertising and controlling browser settings, California consumers may also use the Digital Advertising Alliance's tool to send requests under the CCPA for a web browser to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of that framework's participating companies by accessing the DAA's tool here: [https://www.privacyrights.info/](https://www.privacyrights.info/), or by downloading the DAA's AppChoices mobile application opt-out here: [https://www.privacyrights.info/appchoices](https://www.privacyrights.info/appchoices).

**Rights Under the CCPA.** Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights – Subject to certain exceptions, if you are a California resident you have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we collected about you during the 12 months before your request. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
* The categories of sources for the personal information we have collected about you;
* Our business or commercial purpose for the information collection;
* The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;
* The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
* Deletion Request Rights – You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

**Non-Discrimination.** We recognize and respect that you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by the business for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

**Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights.** To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above as a California resident, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by contacting us as described in the "Contacting Us" section below.

**Use of an Authorized Agent to Submit a Request.** Only you or a person you formally authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information as a California consumer. If you use an authorized agent to submit such a request, we will require written proof that the authorized agent has been authorized to act on your behalf or a copy of the power-of-attorney document granting that right.

**Direct Marketing.** If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information we have shared with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To request a notice, please submit your request by postal mail to the contact information listed below.

**Section 6. Protecting Your Information**

We have implemented reasonable measures designed to help secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL or other encryption technology, or will use our third party payment processors, who will use appropriate security procedures.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for access to certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share your password with anyone or reuse your password for any other services.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services. If you believe that any of your personal information held by Weee! has possibly been compromised, please contact us immediately as described in the "Contacting Us" section below.

**Section 7. Access, Correction and Deletion of Your Personal Information**

You have the ability to access, correct, and delete your personal information that you shared with us on our Services or through other written or oral means. We are committed so that your personal information is kept accurate and up to date. However, it is up to you to update it with any changes. In most cases, you can review and submit changes to your personal information by logging into the Site and visiting your account profile page. You may also notify us via the information in the "Contacting Us" section below to request access to, or to correct any personal information that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to delete or change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

If you no longer wish to have your personal information processed, you may request to delete your account (username and password), subject to certain limitations, by contacting us as described below.

**Section 8. Deletion of Your Account**

Upon your request, we will delete your account information in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy and anonymize certain account information as needed.

As a seller of consumer goods, we may be legally obligated or permitted to keep certain information for a longer term. Accordingly, even after receiving your request to delete your account, we may retain some of your information pursuant to legal purposes or business operations (e.g. for legal compliance; tax, accounting, or auditing purposes; to address recall of consumer goods sold on our website; to resolve disputes or otherwise enforce our legal rights; to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity; or investigation necessitated by any of the foregoing).
