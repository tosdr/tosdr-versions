You may modify or cancel orders via the "Order Detail" section before the cutoff time, or by contacting our Customer Service Department at [support@sayweee.com](http://mailto:support@sayweee.com/).
2. **Price.** The prices displayed through our website may differ from the prices offered by other sellers for the same products, and may not be the lowest prices available. Weee! reserves the right to change prices at any time, and to limit either your order or the quantity of a product you may order. If certain products are not priced correctly, Weee! may cancel orders for the products. We will contact you immediately and will issue you a refund for the products.
3. **Availability.** To provide you the freshest products, we receive goods every day, and products are prepared and packed close to delivery time. On occasion, we may experience disruptions in our supply chain including shortages and quality control concerns. As a result, certain products may become unavailable immediately before the scheduled delivery date. In the event of any supply chain disruption that affects your order, we will deliver the rest of your order and issue you a refund for the unavailable items. In such circumstances, you'll receive a system notification, and see the unavailable item marked as "Out of Stock" on the invoice. If something is missing from your order, and is not marked as "Out of Stock", please submit a refund request via the "Shipped Orders-Return" section on the mobile application or the website, or contact our Customer Service Department at [support@sayweee.com](http://mailto:support@sayweee.com/).
4. **Availability (Marketplace).** The Weee! Marketplace (Marketplace) display products offered by certain vendors (Sellers). Weee! does not have direct control over the supply and availability of products offered by Sellers. As a result, certain products become unavailable immediately before the scheduled delivery date. In such event, please contact our Customer Service Department at [support@sayweee.com](http://mailto:support@sayweee.com/).
5. **Cancellations.** Before the cutoff time, you may cancel orders via the "My Account" section. We will charge a fee for cancellations made after the cutoff time. The cancellation fee equals the total amount of the restaurant food and any other items that cannot be resold due to the late cancellation.
6. **Weee! Points.** Weee! Points are issued by Weee! as credits that may be used to purchase eligible goods and services on Weee!. Weee! Points can be purchased ("Refundable Weee! Points", see complete definition below) or earned as rewards ("Non-Refundable Weee! Points"). To view your Weee! Points balance or check your account history, visit your Account.
    1. **Limitations.** Your Weee! Points may only be used on eligible goods and services provided by Weee! and cannot be used on other websites, to purchase additional Weee! Points, and cannot be sold to other users or transferred to other accounts.
    2. **Refundable Weee! Points.** Refundable Weee! Points are limited to: (1) Weee! Points awarded from the Wholesale Commission program; (2) Weee! Points awarded from the Affiliate Commission earned by group-leaders; and (3) Weee! Points purchased with money. Any other rewarded Weee! Points do not have a cash value and CANNOT be returned for a cash refund in the form of a check.
    3. **Non-Refundable Weee! Points.** Non-Refundable Weee! Points awarded as a bonus, rebate, or incentive (e.g., Weee! Points awarded for account sign ups, friend referrals, product sharing, review writing, product photo posting) are not refundable (e.g., customer spends $100 which equals 10,000 Weee! Points, but they can get a special promotion with an additional 5,000 Weee! Points, the 10,000 Weee! Points are refundable, the 5,000 Weee! Points are non-refundable). Upon your request for refund of any Weee! Points, only **Refundable Weee! Points** will be refunded. **Non-Refundable Weee! Points** will be forfeited. All refunds will be issued by check.
    4. **Refundable Weee! Points Become Non-Refundable Upon Use.** Once you use Refundable Weee! Points to make a purchase, the Refundable Weee! Points become Non-Refundable Weee! Points. Only unused Refundable Weee! Points are eligible for a cash refund in the form of a check (e.g., customer has 1,000 Refundable Weee! Points, the customer uses 500 Weee! Points to place an order and then cancels the order for a refund; the 500 Weee! Points go back to the customer's account as Non-Refundable Weee! Points which means the customer can still use the Weee! Points to place another order but those 500 Weee! Points are no longer refundable).
    5. **Risk of Loss.** Weee! is not responsible if any Weee! Points are lost, stolen, destroyed, or used without your permission. You are responsible for protecting your Weee! Points from unauthorized use. Weee! bears no liability for any unlawful conduct or fraud using Weee! Points.
7. **Payments.** Payments for products or services on Weee! may be made through Weee! Points or an authorized and unexpired payment card. Weee! reserves the right to either cancel or amend any order in the event of an expired, fraudulent, or otherwise suspicious payment method.

Marketplace Products will be delivered through a third-party courier unaffiliated with Weee!. These couriers have a direct relationship with the Sellers. The range for delivery time shall be provided to you at checkout. A tracking link will be sent to an email account designated by you to track the status of the delivery.

**Section 6. Promotions & Discounts**

Weee!, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to offer promotions and discounts with different features and different rates to our users, and may modify, suspend, terminate, or cancel any promotions or discounts at any time without notice and for any or no reason. A promotion or discount cannot be transferred or resold, cannot be used for non-qualifying or past orders, may be limited to specific products, may be subject to additional terms and conditions, and may be limited or rescinded. Only one (1) coupon can be used per order.

Abuse of any promotion or discount, including the use of multiple accounts associated with the same customer or group of customers, is a violation of our policy, and will result in order cancellation in addition to suspension or termination of the account. For example, if Weee! finds that users are creating duplicate accounts to use limited promotions or coupons multiple times, Weee! reserves the right to cancel or void the order, and close the customer account.

Promotions and discounts do not apply to purchases from the Marketplace unless the terms of such promotion and discount explicitly state that it applies.

The Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties, representations or endorsements of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Weee! disclaims all warranties of any kind, express, implied, statutory or otherwise (including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, any warranty for information, data, data processing services or uninterrupted access or use). Weee! does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the Services will be free of viruses or other harmful components. Weee! does not make any representations or warranties regarding the access or use of, or the results of the use of, the content on the Services (including all descriptions, images, references, features, specifications, information, data, products, and prices/availability of products described or depicted on the Services or services offered through the Services) in terms of its availability, usefulness, completeness, correctness, accuracy, reliability, validity, suitability, timeliness, correct sequencing, or otherwise. Applicable law may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some or all of these disclaimers may not apply to you.

**Section 11. Limitation of Liability/Remedy**

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, under no circumstances (other than injury to the person in the case of consumer goods) shall Weee! be liable for any consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or indirect damages, or any lost profits or lost revenues, resulting from, based on, or arising out of (i) your access or use of, or inability to access or use, the Services; (ii) any transaction conducted through or facilitated by the Services; (iii) any claim attributable to errors, omissions, deficiencies, or other inaccuracies in the Services; (iv) any unauthorized access to, or use, disclosure or alteration of, your transmissions of data including, without limitation, your personal information or payment card information; (v) statements or conduct of any third party on the Services; or (vi) any other matter related to the Services, even if Weee! or a Weee! representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Weee!'s total liability to you (excluding any liability for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods), whether under contract, warranty, tort (including but not limited to negligent, but excluding grossly negligent, reckless and intentional, acts of Weee!), product liability, strict liability or any other theory, arising from these Terms or your access to and/or use of the Services for any reason whatsoever shall be limited in the aggregate to the total of all payments you have made to Weee! (if any) during the thirty (30) day period preceding the date of such claim. If you are dissatisfied with any of the Services, or any services provided through any of the Services, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Services. Applicable law may not allow some or all of this exclusion or limitation of liability for damages, so some of these exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.

**Section 12. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Weee!, including and not limited to its  subsidiaries and affiliates, and their directors, officers, managers, employees, donors, agents, and licensors, from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any violation of these Terms or the failure to fulfill any obligations relating to your account incurred by you or any other person using your account. We reserve the right to take over the exclusive defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under these Terms. In such an event, you agree to provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us.

**Section 13. Arbitration Agreement**

If you are a Weee! member in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Weee! agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Weee! Services, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable statutory rights. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Weee! are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Weee! membership.

If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claims court action, you must first send to Weee!, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice"). The Notice to Weee! must be addressed to: Legal Department, Weee! Inc., 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, CA 94538 ("Notice Address") cc: legal@sayweee.com. If Weee! initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Weee!, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Weee! and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Weee! may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.

You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Weee! receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Weee! will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Weee! and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law.

If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US. $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Weee!'s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Weee! did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Weee! will pay you the amount of the award or US$250, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

YOU AND WEEE! AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Weee! agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
