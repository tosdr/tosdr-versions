##### III. General information on data processing

1\. Scope of processing personal data

In general, we only process the personal data of our users to the extent necessary to provide a functioning website with our content and services. The regular processing of personal data only takes place with the consent of the user. Exceptions include cases where prior consent cannot be technically obtained and where the processing of the data is permitted by law.

2\. Legal basis for data processing

Where consent is appropriate for processing personal data, Art. 6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis to obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of their data.

As for the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract of which the data subject is party, Art. 6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual activities.

When it is necessary to process personal data in order to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) (1) (c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If the processing of data is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or that of a third party, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the interest of the former, Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR will serve as the legal basis for the processing of data.

3\. Data removal and storage duration

The personal data of the data subject will be erased or restricted as soon as the purpose of its storage has been accomplished. Additional storage may occur if this is provided for by the European or national legislator within the EU regulations, law, or other relevant regulations to which the data controller is subject. Restriction or erasure of the data also takes place when the storage period stipulated by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need to prolong the storage of the data for the purpose of concluding or fulfiling the respective contract.

##### IV. Rights of the data subject

When your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR and have the following rights:

You may request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under the following conditions:

* The processing is unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and instead request the restriction of their use instead.
* The data controller or its representative no longer need the personal data for the purpose of processing, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims; or
* If you have objected to the processing pursuant and it is not yet certain whether the legitimate interests of the data controller override your interests.

4\. Right to erasure ("Right to be forgotten") (Art. 17 GDPR)

If you request from the data controller to delete your personal data without undue delay, they are required to do so immediately if one of the following applies:

The following data is collected:

* Browser type and version used
* The user's operating system
* The IP address of the user
* Date and time of access
* Web pages from which the user’s system accessed our website

This data is stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.

2\. Purpose of data processing

The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary for the delivery of the website to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the user’s IP address must be kept for the duration of the session.

The storage in logfiles is done to ensure the functionality of the website. The data is also used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our IT systems. An analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not take place.

For the aforementioned purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the processing of data in compliance with Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.

3\. Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and logfiles is Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.

4\. Duration of storage

The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. The session is complete when the collection of data for the provision of the website is accomplished.

If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage beyond this is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated so that an assignment of the calling client is not possible.

5\. Objection and removal

The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. The user can object to this. Whether the objection is successful is to be determined within the framework of a balancing of interests.

**Twitter:**

Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland

If you carry out an action on our Instagram company profile (e.g. comments, contributions, likes etc.), you may make personal data (e.g. clear name or photo of your user profile) public. However, as we generally or to a large extent have no influence on the processing of your personal data by Instagram, we cannot make any binding statements regarding the purpose and scope of the processing of your data.

Product updates

Publications on the company profile can contain the following content:

* Information about products
* Information about services
* Customer contact

Every user is free to publish personal data.

##### IX. Hosting

The website is hosted on servers of a service provider commissioned by us.

Our service provider is:

OVH GmbH  
Christophstraße 19  
50670 Köln  
Deutschland

The servers automatically collect and store information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits when you visit the website. The stored information is:

* Browser type and version
* Used operating system
* Referrer URL
* Hostname of the accessing computer
* Time and date of the server request
* IP address of the user's device

This data will not be merged with other data sources. The data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website - and server log files are therefore recorded.

The server of the website is geographically located in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA).

##### X. Geotargeting

We use the IP address and other information provided by the user (e.g. the postal code used for registration or ordering) to approach regional target groups (so-called "geotargeting").

The regional target group approach is used, for example, to automatically display regional offers or advertisements that often are more relevant to users. The legal basis for the use of the IP address and any other information provided by the user (e.g. postal code) is Art. 6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in ensuring a more precise target group approach and thus providing offers and advertising with greater relevance for our users.

Part of the IP address and the additional information provided by the user (e.g. postal code) are merely processed and not stored separately.

You can prevent geotargeting by, for example, using a VPN or proxy server that prevents accurate localisation. In addition, depending on the browser you are using, you can also deactivate a location localisation in the corresponding browser settings (as far as this is supported by the respective browser).

We use geotargeting on our website for the following purposes:

* Geoblocking
