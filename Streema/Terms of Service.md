Streema, Inc. Terms of Service
==============================

**Welcome to Streema!** Thank you for using the Streema Service and for taking the time to read this document. Streema, Inc. ("**Streema**", "**we**", "**us**", and/or “**our**”) provides a radio and TV tuning service (the "**Streema Service**") through the website Streema.com as well as other websites owned or operated by Streema (the "**Sites**") and through our mobile applications such as Simple Radio for iOS and Android (collectively, "**Streema Apps**"). Your use of the Streema Service provided through or in connection with the Sites and Streema Apps and your viewing of the content available at the Sites and Streema Apps, is subject to these Terms of Service and the current Streema Privacy Policy published at [https://streema.com/about/privacy/](https://streema.com/about/privacy/). By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you consent to Streema’s collection, use and disclosure of your data, including your personally identifiable information (“PII”), with respect to your use of the Streema Service (as described in our Privacy Policy). These Terms of Service govern access to and use of the Streema Service and any content, information, products or services therein, by all users and content providers. This is a legal agreement between you and Streema. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE OR LINK YOUR CONTENT ON THE STREEMA SERVICE. IF YOU ARE ACCESSING AND USING THE STREEMA SERVICE ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND ALL REFERENCES TO “YOU” IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE APPLY TO THE COMPANY OR LEGAL ENTITY.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND STREEMA THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 13 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR CONSUMERS” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING THE PROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION).**

### 1\. General

**Third-Party Links on the Streema Service**  
The websites (including the online streaming audio and/or TV stations) displayed as search results or linked to by the Streema Service are owned and operated by individuals and/or companies over whom Streema exercises no control. Streema assumes no responsibility for the content of any website or other resource included in any search results or otherwise linked to by the Streema Service. As an example, logos as well as links to radio station streams or TV stations are the copyright or trademarks of each respective radio station or TV station. If, for any reason, the owner and operator of a linked website wishes the link from the Streema Service to be deleted, they must contact Streema ([info@streema.com](mailto:info@streema.com)) and expressly request such deletion.

**Personal Use Only**

If you wish to make commercial use of the Streema Service you must enter into an agreement with Streema to do so. Please contact [info@streema.com](mailto:info@streema.com) for more information.

### 12\. Governing Law and Forum Choice.

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 13 “Dispute Resolution for Consumers,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Streema are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and Streema each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

### 13.Dispute Resolution for Consumers.

The following terms of Section 13 “Dispute Resolution for Consumers” only apply if you are an individual who is using the Streema Service and Streema Content for your own personal use and are not representing a legal entity.

1. Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Streema Service or Streema Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. However, if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you andwe each waive any right to a jury trial.
2. Exceptions and Opt-out. As limited exceptions to Section 13(a) above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court If it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, **you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute** if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email at [info@streema.com](mailto:info@streema.com) or by regular mail at 2255 Glades Rd, Suite 324A, Boca Raton, FL 33431 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms of Service.
3. Starting Arbitration. If you want to begin arbitrating a Dispute, you must send a letter to us at the following address: 2255 Glades Rd, Suite 324A, Boca Raton, FL 33431, requesting arbitration and describing the Dispute. If we want to begin arbitrating a Dispute, we’ll send such a letter to you at the email address or street address that you provided.
4. Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) or a comparable arbitral body (e.g., JAMS), in the event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration). The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by videoconference) or in-person in the county where you live (or at some other location that we both agree to).
5. Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
6. Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9 “Modification of the Streema Service or Terms of Service” above, if Streema changes any of the terms of this Section 13 “Dispute Resolution for Consumers” after the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [info@streema.com](mailto:info@streema.com)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Streema’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Streema in accordance with the terms of this Section 13 “Dispute Resolution for Consumers” as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

### 14.DMCA/Copyright Policy.

Streema respects copyright law and expects its users to do the same. It is Streema’s policy to terminate in appropriate circumstances account holders who repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders. Please see Streema’s Copyright Policy at [https://streema.com/about/copyright/](https://streema.com/about/copyright/), for further information.

### 15\. Miscellaneous Provisions.

The English language version of these Terms of Service is the version that governs your use of the Streema Service and in the event of any conflict between the English language version and a translated version, the English language version will control.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Streema.
