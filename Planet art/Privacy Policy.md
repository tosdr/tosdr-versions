We use different methods to collect Data, including:

Where permitted by applicable law, we may collect and maintain records of calls and chats with our agents, representatives, or employees via message, chat, post, or similar functionality. Our chatbox vendors may also retain records of your chats with us.

Additionally, data from direct interactions may be collected through third parties that have their own privacy policies and procedures regarding the collection and processing of your data. When using the ChatGPT functionality on the Sites, you consent to our collection of and the transfer and processing of the data you provide in the chat, to ChatGPT.

These interactions also include data you provide when you create an account, subscribe to our Services, search for a product, place an order, upload a photo or other content, create a seller profile on our Services that offer seller capabilities, participate in discussion boards or other social media functions on our Services, enter a competition, promotion or survey, and when you report a problem with our Services. If you choose to make any seller profile that you create public, people may see your name, the country you designate in your profile, and your “About” details. You can adjust the privacy settings for your seller profile at any time.

**Automated Technologies or Interactions**. As you interact with our Services, we may automatically collect Data about your Device and your browsing actions and patterns, even if you do not create an account or place an order with us. We collect this Data by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technologies. You can block cookies in your browser by activating the settings that allow you to refuse all or some cookies. **IMPORTANT NOTE: if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), the Services may not function properly or may not work at all**.

**Cross-Device Tracking**: Some of our Services use data analytics companies, advertising networks, and/or social media companies to engage in “cross-Device tracking,” which occurs when platforms, publishers, and advertising technology companies try to connect a consumer’s activity across smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, and other connected devices. Cross-Device tracking enables us to link your behavior with our Services across Devices.

**Third parties or Publicly Available Sources**. We receive Data from third parties such as business partners and sub-contractors who provide us with a variety of business services like shipping and payment processing, advertising, analytics, search information, etc.

**User Contributions**. You may also provide us with Data to post on the Services or to transmit to third parties (collectively, "User Contributions"). User Contributions are submitted at your own risk. We limit access to certain pages, and you can also adjust privacy settings for User Contributions by logging into your account profile. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to view your User Contributions.

**Other Data We Collect**

In addition to PII, we collect other Data from you when you use the Services, including:

Our business is customization! Depending on the Services you use and products you decide to create, you may select customization features reflecting skin tone, gender, gender identity, religious dress, disability status, sexual orientation, or other similar information, or revealing this or similar information through use of video and voice recording features. We strive to be inclusive in our product customization offerings and use this information to create that special product for your intended recipient.

For EU Data Subjects, please use the form located at the Manage Personal Information link at the bottom of each webpage to request correction of your PII.

### 9\. How Long We Use and Store PII

We store PII from the time of collection as follows, unless contractual or legal obligations require us to store it for a different period:

If you neither create an account nor buy anything (even as a guest) we will delete PII about you at the earlier of your revocation of consent or in accordance with our Cookie Notice.

If you either create an account, or buy as a guest, we will delete PII about you at the first of the following:

1. You ask us to;
2. You have not created an account on any of our Services for a period of nine (9) years, or made a sale from any seller account;
3. You haven’t purchased anything for nine (9) years; or
4. With regard to a Social Security Number or Tax ID Number, you have not made a sale from any account using that number for a period of seven (7) years.

Pursuant to our contractual relationship with Meta, we store Platform Data received from Meta for no longer than five (5) years. See the Meta terms [here](https://developers.facebook.com/terms/dfc_platform_terms/#datause) for additional information.

### 10\. How We Protect Data

The Services have physical, electronic, and administrative security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure of Data under our control. When you submit credit card information through the Services, we create a nonce so your credit card information is never stored by us. While no transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure, and we strive to protect PII during transmission, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Data that you transmit to or receive from us. We urge you to take steps to keep Data safe (including your account password), log out of your account after use, and close your web browser.

### 11\. Opt-Out Preferences

California and Virginia residents may opt out of the sale and/or sharing of their information by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) (on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal). To download and use a browser supporting the GPC browser signal, click here: [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs). If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.

We can only link your request to opt-out of sale/sharing to your browser or device identifier, and not to any information about any account you may have with us. The connection between your browser or device and any account you have with us is not known to us. Accordingly, now that we have implemented GPC recognition, any prior choices you have made regarding sale/sharing of your personal information are no longer valid. If you wish to opt out of the sale/sharing of your information, you will need to do so by rebroadcasting the GPC signal to us now and again in the future to the extent you visit our website with a different device or clear the cookies cache from your current device.

You may also make a verifiable CCPA request on behalf of your minor child. To designate someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, you may upload proof of the authorization to [privacy@pallcprivacy.com](mailto:privacy@pallcprivacy.com).  
      
    You may make a verifiable CCPA request for access only twice within any 12-month period. The verifiable CCPA request must:  
    
21. provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are either the person we collected Personal Information about or their authorized representative, which may include information that you have already provided to us, such as your name and email address; and
22. describe your CCPA request in sufficient detail so that we can properly understand your request and respond to it.
23. We may not respond to your CCPA request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information is about you or someone you are legally authorized to act on behalf of. Making a verifiable CCPA request does not require you to create an account with us.  
      
    We will use Personal Information provided in a verifiable CCPA request only to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.  
      
    
24. **CCPA Response Timing and Format**  
    We endeavor to respond to verifiable CCPA requests within forty-five (45) days of their receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days) to respond to your request, we will inform you in writing of the reason and the needed extension period. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the email address you provide on the CCPA Request Form.  
      
    Any CCPA disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable CCPA request. Our response will also explain the reasons we are not complying with your CCPA request, if applicable.  
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable CCPA request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the CCPA request warrants a fee, we will tell you why and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.  
    
25. **CCPA Non-Discrimination**  
    We do not discriminate against California residents for exercising their CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:  
      
    

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

**CCPA Notice of Financial Incentive**  
We may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale, retention, and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.  
  
Pursuant to the CCPA, this Notice is to provide you with information regarding any financial incentive or “price or service difference" that we may provide in exchange for your personal information. The Personal Information collected from you in exchange for financial incentive or “price or service difference” may include collecting the following categories of personal information from customers who participate: identifiers; customer records; protected class and demographic information; commercial information and preferences; internet or other electronic network activity information and device information; audio, electronic, visual, or other sensory information; and inferences.  
  
In order to participate in our rewards program(s) and use our services, you may provide Personal Information from time to time, directly or indirectly, in exchange for cash, gift cards, or other financial incentive, or price or service difference, the amount or nature of which will be specified in each instance at the time the Personal Information is to be submitted. You can opt-in to the financial incentive or price or service difference by submitting Personal Information. If you wish to opt-out of the financial incentive or price or service difference, do not submit the Personal Information. If you opt-in and subsequently wish to withdraw from the financial incentive or price or service difference, you may request such withdrawal by contacting us here: [OneTrust Form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/4598626a-4210-4619-ad7d-305919e492b9/60beb590-0b2a-46d2-956d-3e3dab7075e6).  
  
Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of Personal Information is based upon our sole reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, taking into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty. We calculate the value of the offer and financial incentive by using the expense related to the offer. By participating in any of the above promotional programs, you agree that the benefits are reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information collected and contained.

### 16\. Addendum for Persons Located in the European Union, UK, EEA and Switzerland

This **Addendum for Persons Located in the European Union, UK, EEA and Switzerland** (this “GDPR Notice”) supplements the information contained in the Privacy Policy and applies solely to persons located in the EU, UK, EEA and Switzerland. We adopt this GDPR Notice to comply with GDPR, and any terms defined in GDPR (including Personal Data) have the same meaning when used in this GDPR Notice.

**In General**

We **do not** intentionally collect, use, process, share or store special categories of Personal Data, although you may provide information which constitutes special category Personal Data as part of your personalization choices.

**Who is Responsible for Personal Data About You?**

We are responsible for Personal Data about you. Specifically Personal Data is controlled by:

Privacy Program,  
Attention: Legal Department  
Gateway House, Tollgate, Chandler’s Ford,  
Eastleigh, Southampton, S053 3TG,  
United Kingdom

We have appointed ITG EU & GRCI Law to act as our EU and UK Representatives. If you wish to exercise your rights under EU GDPR or the UK GDPR or have any queries in relation to your rights or privacy matters generally please email from Europe [privacyeu@pallcprivacy.com](mailto:privacyeu@pallcprivacy.com), or from UK [privacyuk@pallcprivacy.com](mailto:privacyuk@pallcprivacy.com).

We may need to request additional information from you in order to confirm your identity before responding to your request or question.

**On Which EU Legal Basis Do We Process Personal Data About You?**

Depending on the specific purpose or purposes for the processing of the Personal Data, we rely on the following legal grounds:

* Performance of your customer contract or other contractual obligations or in order to take steps before entering into a contract with you;
* Compliance with a legal obligation (such as record obligations for our commercial or tax purposes or other regulatory obligations);
* Protection of your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person; or
* Our legitimate interests or those of any third-party recipients that receive the Personal Data, provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms;
* Important reasons of public interest;
* The establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

Legitimate interests include, for example, developing and improving our internal administration or business and service processes, marketing and reputation activities, keeping our records up to date, handling and managing our legal and contractual duties and obligations, and compliance with internal and legal policies and regulations that apply to us.

In addition, we process Personal Data to let you know about updates to products and services you have purchased from us or expressed interest in before.

**Will Personal Data About You be Transferred Outside the EU/EEA?**

Our headquarters and operations are in the United States, UK and Ireland. We strive to store and process EU, UK, EEA and Swiss Personal Data in Ireland, on the servers located in the EU. With the exception of Personal Creations and Café Press, all EU/EEA customer Personal Data is processed and stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers located in Ireland (see more information below). Personal Creations and Café Press customer Personal Data is processed and stored on AWS Servers in the U.S.

**Notice Re: EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, CJEU Schrems II Ruling and EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC)**

We have withdrawn from the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States as further described below.

On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (CJEU) determined that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework is no longer valid for the transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. (known as the Schrems II decision). The Schrems II decision also placed additional compliance requirements on the use of EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for the transfer of EU/EEA Personal Data to the U.S. by companies subject to Section 702 of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and/or Executive Order 12333 (E.O. 12333).

We know our customers, website visitors, and business partners care deeply about privacy and data security, and we optimize our work to get these issues right. We’d like to confirm that you can continue to use our Services with regard to EU and EEA Personal Data in compliance with EU law.

**First**, please know that it is our good-faith belief that the types of EU/EEA Personal Data we collect, use, process, share and/or store in the U.S. are not of the types of Personal Data that would generally be subject to requests from U.S. government authorities pursuant to FISA Section 702 and/or E.O. 12333.

**Second**, please note that as part of our good-faith efforts to comply with applicable data protection laws, we strive to continue to store and process EU, EEA, UK and Swiss Personal Data in Ireland, on servers located in the EU. In compliance with the GDPR and other applicable laws we also implement data encryption, data minimization, data pseudonymization, and need to know access to Personal Data.

**Third**, although we have withdrawn from Privacy Shield, we are retaining the data collected during our participation, and are providing adequate protection for such data by another authorized means.

**Fourth**, when international transfer of Personal Data is necessary to perform a contract with you, or in individual cases for the purposes of our compelling legitimate business interests and in order to comply with our internal policies, contractual and legal obligations.

If you represent one of our service providers or business partners and your organization is a party to an agreement with us that includes EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for compliance with EU/EEA data protection laws, please contact us at [privacy@pallcprivacy.com](mailto:privacy@pallcprivacy.com) to discuss whether any updates to our agreement are needed resulting from the Schrems II decision.

Trust is a top priority for us, and we will continue to work vigilantly to ensure that our customers, website visitors, and business partners are able to continue to enjoy the benefits of our Services securely, compliantly, and without disruption.

**Your Consent to Transfer of Personal Data**

In addition to the above, we may also process, store, and/or transfer Personal Data we collect about you, in and to a country outside the EU including the United States. Those other countries may have different privacy laws that may or may not be as comprehensive as your own.

By submitting Personal Data or interacting with our Services, you consent to this transfer, storing, and/or processing including in the United States.
