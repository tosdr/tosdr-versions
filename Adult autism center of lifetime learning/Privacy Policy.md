Adult Ability Center of Lifetime Learning
=========================================

The Adult Ability Center is an extension of the evidence-based treatment we provide at the existing Pingree Center but focuses on daily living and vocational skills. The program utilizes applied behavior analysis (ABA) when providing treatment.

The goal is increased independence for each client based on their abilities and interests. We provide access to the community via internship, volunteer, and supported employment opportunities.

The program will utilize evidence based practices based in applied behavior analysis to provide high quality treatment focusing on vocational and life long learning skills.

### Educational Strategies

Evidence based treatment focusing on vocational and life-long learning skills will be provided at the Adult Ability Center.

* The program will access pre-employment, employment, and life-long learning skills training through curriculum in Rethink Ed and the National Technical Assistance Center on Transition.
* All programs will focus on increasing individuals skills to increase independence across identified program areas.
* These areas include: Community access, Home Living, Social/Leisure, Fitness, and Vocational training.

The Adult Ability Center Programs
---------------------------------

The Adult Ability Center serves the needs of adults requiring a high level of support —those with lower cognitive and communication skills as well as the most challenging behavioral issues. With personalized care and instruction, individuals will learn valuable skills and achieve a higher level of independence.
