------------------------------------------

UNC-Chapel Hill has taken steps to help protect the Personal Information we collect and use and we review the security practices of service providers trusted to process data for UNC-Chapel Hill. We use physical, technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards designed to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information we collect through our Sites. Our security controls are designed to maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and an appropriate level of availability. But no transmission and storage of data is completely secure, and submissions are at your sole risk. As such, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or provide through our Sites. For more information on UNC-Chapel Hill’s information security practices, visit: [safecomputing.unc.edu](http://safecomputing.unc.edu/).

Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as social media platforms, becomes public, and therefore this Statement does not apply to information you choose to make public. Please be careful about what you choose to disclose. Do not post any personal information that you expect to keep private.

You are responsible for notifying us immediately of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of any accounts you may have on our Sites, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your account credentials, or any other personal information. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity on your account may be reported to appropriate law enforcement agencies by us. In the event of a confirmed security incident that involves Sites user’s personal information, we will notify you, the respective regulator, law enforcement, and/or individuals of such incident as required by applicable law or where UNC-Chapel Hill deems appropriate.

Our Sites may contain links to sites operated by third parties (“Third-Party Sites”). Please be advised that the practices described in this Statement do not apply to information gathered through these Third-Party Sites. UNC-Chapel Hill does not endorse, review, or have any control over the content, products, or services of linked websites or their privacy policies, and UNC-Chapel Hill is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies or organizations, and once you leave the Sites, you should read the applicable privacy policy of the other company. If you decide to access any of the linked websites, you do so at your own risk.

International Transfer of Personal Information of People Living Outside the United States

Personal Information provided to us by users outside of the United States may be transferred to other countries such as the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those of your home country. By providing us with your information you are giving your affirmative consent that your Personal Information will be transferred to the United States and processed and stored on servers in the United States. However, all reasonable steps will be taken to protect your privacy in accordance with the applicable data protection laws.

European Economic Area Data Subject Rights
------------------------------------------

If you are an individual located in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”) only, to the extent required by and in accordance with applicable law, you will have the following rights regarding your Personal Information:

1\. Right of access. You may request details of your Personal Information that we hold. We will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Information and we will disclose supplementary information including the categories of Personal Information, the sources from which it originated, the purpose and legal basis for the processing, the expected retention period, and the safeguards regarding Personal Information transfers to non-EEA countries, subject to the limitations set out in applicable statutes, regulations and other laws.

2\. Right of correction. We will comply with your request to edit and update incorrect Personal Information promptly.

3\. Right to be forgotten. At your request, we will delete your Personal Information promptly if:

i. it is no longer necessary to retain your Personal Information;

ii. you withdraw the consent which formed the basis of your Personal Information processing;

iii. you object to the processing of your Personal Information and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for such processing;

iv. the Personal Information was processed illegally; or

v. the Personal Information must be deleted for us to comply with our legal obligations.

We will inform any third parties we might have shared your Personal Information with of your deletion request.

We will decline your request for deletion if processing of your Personal Information is necessary:

vi. to comply with our legal obligations;

vii. in pursuit of a legal action;

viii. to detect and monitor fraud; or

ix. for the performance of a task in the public interest.

4\. Right to restrict processing of your Personal Information. At your request, we will limit the processing of your Personal Information if:

i. you dispute the accuracy of your Personal Information;

ii. your Personal Information was processed unlawfully and you request a limitation on processing, rather than the deletion of your Personal Information;

iii. we no longer need to process your Personal Information, but you require your Personal Information in connection with a legal claim; or

iv. you object to the processing pending verification as to whether an overriding legitimate ground for such processing exists.

5\. Right to notice related to correction, deletion, and limitation on processing. In so far as it is practicable, we will notify you of any correction, deletion, and/or limitation on processing of your Personal Information.

6\. Right to data portability. At your request, we will provide you free of charge with your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable format, if:

ii. the processing of your Personal Information is based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract; or

iii. the processing is carried out by automated means.

7\. Right to object. Where we process your Personal Information based upon our Legitimate Interest then you have the right to object to this processing.

8\. Right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing. You will not be subject to decisions with a legal or similarly significant effect (including profiling) that are based solely on the automated processing of your Personal Information, unless you have given us your explicit consent or where those decisions are necessary for a contract with us.

9\. Right to withdraw consent. You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of our collecting, using and sharing of your Personal Information up to the point in time that you withdraw your consent. Even if you withdraw your consent, we may still use your information that has been fully anonymized and does not personally identify you.

10\. Right to complain to a supervisory authority. If you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to complain to or seek advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against us in any court of competent jurisdiction.

If you wish to contact us in connection with the exercise of your rights listed above, including your right to opt-out of targeted advertising and profiling, please email us at [privacy@unc.edu](mailto:privacy@unc.edu). We will respond to your written request as soon as possible and in accordance with any deadlines imposed by law.

### Do Not Track Signals

Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells websites that users do not want to have their online activity tracked. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, UNC-Chapel Hill does not currently require that websites respond to DNT signals.
