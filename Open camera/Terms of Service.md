**Requirements**
----------------

Open Camera requires Android 4.0.3 or better. Some features may only be available on some devices (it may depend on Android version, or require specific support from the camera/device).

Note that it's not possible for me to test Open Camera on every Android device out there, let alone in combination with different Android versions (or especially alternative ROMs). Please test before using Open Camera to photo/video your wedding etc :)

See [here](https://opencamera.org.uk/devices.html) for some details on issues with various devices.
