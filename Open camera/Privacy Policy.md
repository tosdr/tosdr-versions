Open Camera Privacy Policy
--------------------------

< [Main Page.](https://opencamera.org.uk/index.html)

Open Camera is developed by Mark Harman.

Open Camera accesses and records camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos and recording videos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera. Microphone permission is also used for the optional "Audio control" options.

Open Camera requires permission (at least for Android 9 and earlier, or using versions of Open Camera older than 1.48.3) to "access photos, media and files on your devices" (storage permission), as this permission is required for Android to save resultant files such as photos and videos to your device.

Location permission is requested in order to deliver the optional geotagging features (for photos and videos, including stamp and subtitles options). When relevant option(s) are enabled, your device location will be stored in photo/video/subtitle files.

Bluetooth permissions are used to allow the optional feature to discover and connect to Bluetooth LE remote control devices; the Bluetooth remote control feature also requires location permission (on Android 11 or earlier) or Nearby Devices permission (on Android 12 or later).

Resultant data such as photos or videos can be shared with other apps if you use the share option in Open Camera, or when Open Camera is called by another app on your device, or when you use the Storage Access Framework option to save to another app or service.

Data handling procedures, data retention and deletion policies: Open Camera does not transmit personal or sensitive information to me.

Since Open Camera also uses operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts. For example:

* For versions 1.49.2 or earlier: the optional voice control option used the Android [speech recognition service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer). When enabled, audio data is likely to be sent to remote servers by Android to perform speech recognition. This is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, located at [https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/) , as updated from time to time. This option is no longer available in version 1.50 onwards.
* For versions 1.49.2 or earlier: The "addresses" option for photo stamp or video subtitles used the Android [Geocoder API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder). When this option is enabled, in order to deliver this functionality the API transmits your device location data across the Internet to a third party (which may depend on what "backend services" are installed on your device). This option is no longer available in version 1.50 onwards.
* Apps/services such as cloud services on your device may auto-upload photos and videos that are saved on your device.
