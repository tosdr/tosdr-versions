Privacy Policy
==============

The Art of Education University understands the importance of protecting the privacy of our community members. This policy should answer all questions related to what data we collect when you engage with our website, what we do with that data, and what you can do if these practices do not meet your expectations.  
The scope of this policy includes our website visitors and registered users only. For information regarding data collected from and privacy protection for our students and prospective students, please see our [Graduate Catalog](https://theartofeducation.edu/courses/academic-catalog-archive/).

**What Information Do We Collect?**  
What information we collect from you depends on how you choose to engage with our website. Our website is designed for practicing K–12 teachers; therefore, we do not collect any data from children under 16 years of age.

**Who owns data collected by The Art of Education University?**  
The Art of Education University acknowledges that all personally identifiable information (PII) about students, teachers, and administrators is the property of the customers that AOEU serves.

**Website Visitors**  
We use cookies to collect information about our website visitors, including IP addresses, operating systems, devices used to access the website, browsers used, time spent on individual pages, search queries, and links engaged. By using our website, you consent to our collection of this information. If users adjust browser privacy settings to refuse cookies, they will not be able to engage with our site as registered users.

**Do Not Track (DNT) Disclosures**  
Some web browsers offer users a DNT option, which, when engaged, sends a signal to websites that users visit, indicating that the user prefers the DNT option.

AOEU’s website does not currently respond to DNT signals. Additionally, our partners may collect information about our users and their online activities over time and across our services in relation to our contract with those services. We do not obligate these parties to honor DNT signals sent as a result of user preference settings with their web browsers. AOEU uses cookies to track registered users’ journeys through the AOEU website. Cookies help us collect analytical information, such as which pages a user visits and how much time users spend on each page.  
AOEU utilizes Google Analytics and Gainsight PX for statistical analysis of our web usage. Users can opt-out of usage data being included in our Google Analytics reports by visiting [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Registered Users**  
Visitors who register for an account with us, sign up for any of our services or promotions, submit survey information, or otherwise knowingly submit personally identifiable information are consenting for us to have, store, and use this information according to the expectations set forth in our [Terms and Conditions](https://theartofeducation.edu/terms-and-conditions/).

**How Do We Use the Information We Collect?**  
We use data collected via cookies for statistical analysis to help us improve our site and deliver a more personalized experience. Our website visitors are anonymous to us unless they log in to an AOEU website account, or one of our subscription services. We use IP addresses to identify repeat visitors and customize visitors’ AOEU website experiences according to preferences. This data also helps us estimate our audience size and usage patterns, which contributes to better processing speed for our users.

We use personally identifiable information, such as email addresses and phone numbers, to communicate with our registered users and share updates, promotions, event announcements, and other information we assume our registered users are interested in receiving. At any time, if a registered user would like to unsubscribe from mailing lists, they may use the links provided in each of our newsletters to unsubscribe or manage communication preferences. We also may archive email messages exchanged with registered users for various purposes, including improving customer service, keeping a record of our transactions, and fulfilling user needs.

Users who want their personally identifiable information permanently removed from our databases may contact us at [help@theartofeducation.edu](mailto:help@theartofeducation.edu) for support.

**Who Else Has Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information?**  
The Art of Education University does not sell our users’ personally identifiable information to third parties.  
Various employees at the Art of Education University have access to stored personally identifiable information according to the needs of the employees’ roles at AOEU. These include, but are not limited to:

* Support services
* Marketing
* Curriculum development
* Product development
* Technology support
* Compliance
* Data management

AOEU engages with contractors, service providers, and other third parties to support our business operations. These parties are bound by contractual obligations to protect our users’ data in the same manner as our employees and are prohibited from sharing our users’ data or using it for purposes outside the scope of our contracted purposes.  
AOEU does not disclose users’ personally identifiable information without user consent or unless it is 1.) to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including responding to governmental or regulatory requests, or 2.) required to protect the rights, property, or safety of AOEU community members.

AOEU may share users’ personally identifiable information with affiliates or successors in the event of a merger, acquisition, or reorganization, but only for uses consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**How Do We Protect Your Personally Identifiable Information?**  
AOEU is committed to ensuring that all data we collect from visitors and registered users is secure. AOEU stores our users’ information on encrypted servers and employs proprietary security mechanisms to safeguard our users’ information and prevent unauthorized access or disclosures.

Unfortunately, no data protection system is 100% secure. While we cannot guarantee our users’ security, we are committed to implementing and maintaining commercially reasonable safeguards to protect our users’ personally identifiable information.

Any additional information about AOEUs security practices can be made available upon request.

AOEU’s Privacy Policy governs users engaged only on AOEU’s website. It is important to note that AOEU’s website contains links to other websites considered to be interesting or useful to our visitors and users. AOEU has no control over data collection, management, and security for users of those websites. AOEU is not responsible for the privacy and protection of users who choose to engage these links and leave AOEU’s website. Please exercise caution, and review the privacy policies of each of the websites you visit.

**How Will We Notify You When This Policy Changes?**  
We will update all registered users of changes to our Privacy Policy via email with the email address we have on file. Non-registered users may visit our Privacy Policy page on our website. Each time we update the policy, we will include the date of the latest update.

**How Can You Contact Us?**  
For questions or concerns regarding this policy or your personally identifiable information, please send an email to help@theartofeducation.edu, or write us at:

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) grants certain rights to our users who are California residents to access or delete the personal information that we have collected about them, to opt-out of the sale of their personal information by us to a third party, and not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights.

**Access**  
_Right to Know of Personal Information Collected_  
You have the right to request what personal information we collected, used, disclosed, and sold about you within the preceding 12 months. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will disclose to you the information we have collected about you as required by the CCPA. If you would like to know more about what personal information we collect and the purpose for which we collect it, please review this Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information of minors under the age of 16.

**Deletion**  
_Right to Have Personal Information Deleted_  
You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information that we collect or maintain. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records unless an exception applies. Such exceptions include, but are not limited to, situations when the personal information is necessary to complete a transaction or provide goods or services to you, detect security incidents, comply with the law, and for internal uses reasonably aligned with your expectations.

**Opt-Out**  
_Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information to Third Parties_  
You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. We have third-party cookies on our website that get access to your information to assist us with analyzing our marketing effectiveness and providing you with tailored content and advertising based on your interactions with our websites. If you would like to know more about how you can control how we collect information using cookies or other technologies, including how to opt-out of the use of certain cookies and other technologies, please review this Privacy Policy. If you opt-out of cookies and then access our website from another device, you will need to opt-out of cookies on the other device as well.

Types of cookies we use:

* Essential cookies: These help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.
* Analytics cookies: These help the website operator understand how its website performs, how visitors interact with the site, and whether there may be technical issues.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

**Non-Discrimination**  
_Right to Not Be Discriminated Against for Exercising Your Privacy Rights_  
You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment if and when you exercise your rights to access, delete, or opt-out under the CCPA.

This means we cannot, for example:

* Deny goods or services to you;
* Charge different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
* Provide a different level or quality of goods or services to you; or
* Suggest that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

**Exercising Your Rights**  
To exercise your right to access or delete the personal information we have collected about you or to exercise your right to opt-out, you may submit a request to [help@theartofeducation.edu](mailto:help@theartofeducation.edu) or call us at 515.650.3198. Once we receive your access or deletion request, we will contact you via email to verify your identity and review your request. We aim to respond to requests for access or deletion within 30 days of receiving the request. If we need more time to respond to your request, we will let you know the reason and how much additional time we will need.

If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us at the mailing address, email address, or toll-free number listed in this Privacy Policy.
