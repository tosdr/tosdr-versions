‍**Additional rights:** you have the following rights in relation to the Personal Information we hold about you.

**YOUR RIGHT**

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**

**WHAT YOU CAN DO**

**To know how we process your Personal Information.**

We are required to provide notice about the way that we will use the Personal Information we collect.

We have set the required notices in this Privacy Notice. We may provide you with additional notice about other ways we process your Personal Data, such as by sending you a notice via email or by other means of communication.

**To access your Personal Information.**

If you request it, we will provide you with access to your Personal Information, along with details about the types of Personal Information we process, why we process it, and any third parties we work with to collect Personal Information on our behalf.

You can request to access your Personal Information (i.e. a copy of it). We may have one or more legally valid reasons to refuse your request in whole or in part, for example in order to protect the rights of other individuals.

**To restrict the processing of your Personal Information.**

In certain circumstances and to the extent required by law, we are required to restrict our processing of your Personal Information.

You can request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information if (i) the data is inaccurate, (ii) the processing is unlawful, (iii) we no longer need the Personal Information, or (iv) you exercise your right to object.

**To rectify your Personal Information.**

We are required to correct the Personal Information we have about you if you inform us that it is incorrect.

If you become aware that the Personal Information that we hold about you is incorrect, or if your situation changes (for example you change address) please inform us and we will update our records.

**To data portability.**

In some circumstances, we are required to provide your Personal Information to another organization at your request and in a format that allows the other organization to read and use it.

You have the right to request that we transfer your Personal Information to another organization (i.e. another data controller) in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format, so that the other organization can read and use it.

**To erasure of your Personal Information (a.k.a. the “right to be forgotten”).**

Upon your request, and in certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, we are required to delete your Personal Information. This right is not absolute, and we may be entitled to retain and process your Personal Information despite your request.

If you make this request, we balance certain legal, contractual and business interests against your right to request the deletion of your Personal Information.

**To object to certain processing of your Personal Information.**

Upon your request, and in certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, we will limit our processing of your Personal Information as you request.

You may object to the processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances. If you make this request, we will consider certain legal, contractual and business interests and obligations against your right to object to the processing. You can also object to our use of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.

**To not be subject to a decision based solely on “automated processing.”**

We are required to keep records of automated processing that we carry out, if any, and, in certain circumstances, provide you with information about the way that the decisions are made, and respond to your objections to being subject to decisions made.

We do not currently make decisions about individuals based solely on automated processing. If we engage in this activity in the future, you will have the right to object to a decision we make wholly by a computer or algorithm without human input and to receive information about this type of processing.

If you want to exercise any of these rights, please make a request to privacy@cronometer.com.
