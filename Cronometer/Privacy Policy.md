If we collect or use your Personal Information based on your consent, we will also notify you of any changes and will request your further consent as needed.    
  
**HOW WE COLLECT & USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION** The Personal Information we collect about you and how we use the Personal Information we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Cronometer, the Site, and our Services.    
  
**Information we collect directly from you, with your consent**. We collect Personal Information directly from you with your consent when you leave a comment or use other interactive features on the Site or communicate with us online or by other means. If you leave a comment on the Site, we collect your email address and IP address to confirm that the comment originated from a Site user and not from a bot or other automated spam generator. If you access or submit an inquiry through our Site, subscribe to a service, register to receive marketing materials, participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, or receive other Services, we may ask you to provide certain personal information such as your name, email address, phone number and zip code, and possibly other Personal Information. We take reasonable steps to make sure that your contact information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable. We use your Personal Information to communicate with you about Cronometer and our Services and for direct marketing purposes, such as:  

* Sending you periodic email and newsletter communications;
* Responding to your inquiries;
* Sending you surveys and other quality assurance communications;
* Analyzing preferences, trends, and statistics;
* Informing you of our new products, services, and offers; and
* Providing you with other marketing information from and about Cronometer.

We will only contact you in ways compatible with your communications choices. However, even if you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may need to contact you to address questions or issues specific to the services you have requested.    
  
We may periodically supplement the Personal Information we collect from you with personal or non-personal information about you or another person obtained from companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships and other third party sources. Any aggregate information that is linked or linkable to your Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Notice.    
  
Currently, Cronometer or our third party service providers retain and store information collected by, or provided to, us in the cloud and on secure, HIPAA compliant servers in the United States. As Cronometer and some of our third party service providers may retain and store information received from users (including Personal Information) outside of Canada, and under the laws of those other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other provinces or foreign jurisdictions may be entitled to access users’ information.    
  
‍**Payment Information.** Cronometer does not collect or maintain any payment information. If you choose to subscribe to our Site and/or Services, our current payment processor, will collect your financial information to facilitate the transaction. We partner with third party service providers and vendors to provide access to existing payment gateways and your credit card, banking and other billing information will be stored only with our payment processor, not with Cronometer. You will be given information regarding our current payment processor, including access to their privacy policy and terms, when you authorize a transaction through the Site.    
  
‍**Information collected from your use of the Site, with a legitimate interest.** We use analytics tools or other technologies to collect information about you from your use of this Site. We collect this information to achieve our legitimate interests of operating the Site and our Service, as well as marketing our Services to a broader audience. This information may be combined with other information that you choose to submit to us. This information may also be merged into aggregate information about site visitors and traffic. We use third-party analytics tools to distinguish and analyze user behavior.  
  
_Log Files._ We collect anonymous and technical information from your computer, including your internet protocol address, data about your computer or other device, the type of browser or operating system your device uses, the programs, services, and version of software you use, and the address of any linking site, when you request a web page while visiting the Site. We use this information for statistical purposes, to ensure that our web pages will appear and function appropriately on your computer, to determine how you were referred to our Site, and to personalize your access to our Site or conduct our own analyses and research to improve our programs, products, services, and content. We may sell, rent, or otherwise convey this anonymous, technical information to a third party, but this information will never constitute Personal Information. We also use third parties to collect and analyze information. If you do not agree with Cronometer or our Services Providers (as defined below) collecting and using your anonymous and technical information as described in this paragraph, discontinue use of the Site or you may contact us as described under “Controlling Your Personal Information.”

As permitted by applicable law, we may share your Personal Information as follows:

* **To Our Service Providers.** Vendors that provide us with various services (collectively, “Service Providers”) may have access to your Personal Information while they are performing their contractual obligations. Examples of Service Providers we use include payment processors, data analytics companies, email delivery, web hosting services, customer service, and marketing services. We prohibit our Service Providers from selling or disclosing the Personal Information we provide, and we require all Service Providers to maintain confidentiality standards that are commercially reasonable to ensure the security of your Personal Information. These Service Providers include but are not limited to marketing companies, companies that host our Site or App, or provide IT services to support either, platforms we use to help us manage our data and companies that assist us in processing job applications that you submit through our Site. The type of information that we provide to a Service Provider will depend on the purpose of the service that they provide to us.
* **For Special Features.** We may offer special features that require transmission of certain data to the third party helping us to provide you with the feature.  In such cases, we will only provide a limited amount of information in accordance with the notice or consent provided at the time you request the feature.  In some cases, we will not transmit personally identifiable information, however, it may involve certain details about you, such as diary data, anthropometrics, targets and other contextual information.  An example of such a feature is the AI assistant available for our “Pro” accounts, where we provide certain limited information to OpenAI with your consent.  If your organization is a Covered Entity under HIPAA with which we have a Business Associate Agreement, it may enable this feature and if so, when you use it we will provide OpenAI with certain limited information under our Business Associate Agreement with OpenAI.
* **To Our Advertisers.** For users accessing our free Services, we disclose certain limited information to Service Providers that are network advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services (collectively, “Advertisers”) to enable those Advertisers to serve targeted advertisements to you on the Site, the App or other Sites or media (e.g., social networking platforms). We allow some Advertisers to assist us with behavioral advertising by collecting and analyzing certain information when you visit our Site (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject clicked or scrolled over). These Advertisers typically use a cookie or other technologies to personalize advertising content and measure the effectiveness of their ads. We do not provide personal health information, or PHI, to Advertisers. Additionally, for users paying for our Services, we may from time to time send you offers from Advertisers, but generally speaking you will not be subject to the targeted advertisements mentioned above.
* **Other Third Parties.** As permitted by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Information to third parties (i) as part of a business transition (e.g. a merger or acquisition by another company); (ii) to comply with federal, state, or local law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, or local authorities; (iii) if we believe it is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Notice, or to exercise or defend our legal claims; or (iv) in any case where we have obtained your prior consent.
* **For Legal and Other Compliance.** We may disclose Personal Information when we believe it is appropriate to: (a) comply with the law, (b) enforce or apply this Privacy Notice or our other policies or agreements, (b) protect our or our users' rights, property or safety, (c) protect our users from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of, our Site, or (d) if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
* **For Lawful Requests**.We do not disclose your Personal Information simply on request.  We will take reasonable, legally allowed measures to protect your information from requests by law enforcement.  It is our policy to disclose personal information to law enforcement and such governmental agencies only in response to a legal instrument issued by an agency or court with competent jurisdiction, such as a search warrant issued upon demonstration of probable cause.  To be clear, however, your personal information may be accessible under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction.  Therefore, if you have concerns about certain types of information being collected by a state actor, please do not add that information to your account.
* **As Part of Business Transfers.** We may disclose Personal Information as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets or other business transaction. In this situation, we will ensure that standard confidentiality and data security measures are agreed to by all parties with access to Personal Information.
* **As Aggregated or Deidentified Information.** We reserve the right to share or sell aggregated, anonymous or deidentified information about any individuals with non-affiliated entities for marketing, advertising, research or other purposes, without restriction. We do not limit the third parties’ use of the aggregated information.
* **As PHI Information.** If information constitutes PHI, we will only use or share PHI in compliance with the privacy and data security requirements of the applicable health information privacy laws, such as HIPAA, and in conformity with the terms and conditions of any applicable Business Associate Agreement.

**SECURITY  
  
‍**‍**Data Security.** It is Cronometer’s policy to treat your Personal Information with complete confidentiality. We minimize the Personal Information we store and employ commercially appropriate and reasonable safeguards both online and offline to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of information that we collect about you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural security measures to safeguard your non-public personal information. We update and test our technology to improve the protection of our information about you and to assure the integrity of that information.    
  
We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy through standard operating procedures and special training programs.    
  
In many instances we employ state-of-the-art, and in any event commercially reasonable, measures to protect your Personal Information, such as two-factor authentication, penetration testing, the implementation of privacy-by-design and thorough vetting of our hosting services providers. However, please note, however, that no transmission of data over the internet is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not defeat those measures and use nonpublic Personal Information for improper purposes. Therefore, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or for actions of third parties. The safety and security of your information also depends on you, and you are responsible for keeping your password confidential. Also, always remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at [http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm) for information about how to help protect yourself against identity theft.    
  
‍**Public Forums.** If you choose to make use of any public forum, comment section or chat function, we may collect any information you may disclose through such means.    
  
‍**In-Media Communications.** If you choose to send a message to another user or defined group of users through our message, chat, post or other function, we may collect any information you may disclose through such means, as well as the necessary Personal Information of the user(s) you are contacting, in order to facilitate the communication.    
  
‍**Third Party Sites.** This Privacy Notice applies only to information collected by Cronometer. We may provide links to third party websites from our Sites as a service to our users, but we have no ability to control, and we are not responsible for, the privacy and data collection, use, and disclosure practices of third party websites. When you click on links that take you to external websites, you will be subject to their privacy policies and practices and not ours. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such websites before providing them with any information.    
  
‍**Photos and Videos.** If you post a video, image or photo on our Site for public view you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your knowledge or consent. We are not responsible for the videos, or photos that you choose to submit to the public sections of our Site. For clarity, there are also private sections of the Site where you can submit content that will not be viewable by other users. Please see our Terms of Service at [https://cronometer.com/terms/](https://cronometer.com/terms/) on this point and for other guidelines about posting content on any portion of our Site.    
  
‍**Updates and Push Notifications.** We may occasionally send you updates, patches and related push notifications that may be of importance to you.

If you choose to enable push notifications, we may use your information such as a device ID or email address in order to send push notifications to your device.    
  
‍**Do Not Track Signals.** Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. For information about Do Not Track, visit [www.allaboutdnt.org](https://cronometer.com/privacy/www.allaboutdnt.org). At this time, Cronometer does not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. In addition, Cronometer may use other technology that is standard to the internet to track visitors to the Site. Those tools may be used by us and by third parties to collect information about you and your internet activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.    
  
‍**Unauthorized Use.** If you become aware of any unauthorized submission of information to Cronometer, including children’s information, please inform us by contacting us at the contact information listed below so that we may delete it.  
  
**RETAINING AND DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
‍  
‍**Cronometer retains Personal Information as long as it is reasonably necessary to provide the Services to you and others such as professionals on your behalf.  This includes consideration of business requirements and legal obligations to retain the information.  You have the ability to delete information from your account at any time.      
  
As described in the “Controlling your Personal Information” section below, you can control many aspects of the information in your account, such as profile information, including by deleting the information or your account.  As described below, you may request deletion of your account by making a request to [privacy@cronometer.com](mailto:privacy@cronometer.com).  Otherwise, we will generally keep information associated with your account until it is no longer reasonably necessary to provide the Services, or until your account is deleted. We may delete accounts that are unused for a certain period, such as no activity for 36 months, depending on the nature of the account. We may consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information and purposes for which it may be processed to determine retention.  We may retain de-identified or aggregated information with other non-personal data indefinitely as it is no longer Personal Information and it may be useful for our business purposes.    
  
Following the deletion of information from your account, your account, or a request for deletion, we take steps to fully delete the Personal Information from our logs and systems within a reasonable time.  We may retain information for a longer period as permitted by law, including for legal compliance and regulatory purposes, to prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, assist with investigations, or enforce our terms or a legal right.  We will handle the information we retain in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

‍**Right to Access.** You have the right to request that we provide you with access to specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you over the past 12 months (also called a data portability request). If you submit a right to access request, we will provide you with copies of the requested pieces of Personal Information in a portable and readily usable format. Please note that Cronometer is prohibited by law from disclosing copies of certain pieces of Personal Information (e.g., government identification numbers, financial account information, and passwords or security questions and answers) because the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the information, our business systems, or your account.

We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer privacy request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.  **Authorized Agent.** You may make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. Otherwise, only you, or a person you have designated in writing as your authorized agent or who is registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf, or to whom you have provided power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465 (“Authorized Agent”) may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information.

If we require more time, we will notify you in writing of the reason and extension period. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of the verifiable consumer request. If we cannot comply with part or all of your request, we will explain the reasons in our response. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer privacy request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.  **Nondiscrimination.** We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

‍**Additional rights:** you have the following rights in relation to the Personal Information we hold about you.

**YOUR RIGHT**

**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**

**WHAT YOU CAN DO**

**To know how we process your Personal Information.**

We are required to provide notice about the way that we will use the Personal Information we collect.

We have set the required notices in this Privacy Notice. We may provide you with additional notice about other ways we process your Personal Data, such as by sending you a notice via email or by other means of communication.

**To access your Personal Information.**

If you request it, we will provide you with access to your Personal Information, along with details about the types of Personal Information we process, why we process it, and any third parties we work with to collect Personal Information on our behalf.

You can request to access your Personal Information (i.e. a copy of it). We may have one or more legally valid reasons to refuse your request in whole or in part, for example in order to protect the rights of other individuals.

**To restrict the processing of your Personal Information.**

In certain circumstances and to the extent required by law, we are required to restrict our processing of your Personal Information.

You can request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information if (i) the data is inaccurate, (ii) the processing is unlawful, (iii) we no longer need the Personal Information, or (iv) you exercise your right to object.

**To rectify your Personal Information.**

We are required to correct the Personal Information we have about you if you inform us that it is incorrect.

If you become aware that the Personal Information that we hold about you is incorrect, or if your situation changes (for example you change address) please inform us and we will update our records.

**To data portability.**

In some circumstances, we are required to provide your Personal Information to another organization at your request and in a format that allows the other organization to read and use it.

You have the right to request that we transfer your Personal Information to another organization (i.e. another data controller) in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format, so that the other organization can read and use it.

**To erasure of your Personal Information (a.k.a. the “right to be forgotten”).**

Upon your request, and in certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, we are required to delete your Personal Information. This right is not absolute, and we may be entitled to retain and process your Personal Information despite your request.

If you make this request, we balance certain legal, contractual and business interests against your right to request the deletion of your Personal Information.

**To object to certain processing of your Personal Information.**

Upon your request, and in certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, we will limit our processing of your Personal Information as you request.

You may object to the processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances. If you make this request, we will consider certain legal, contractual and business interests and obligations against your right to object to the processing. You can also object to our use of your Personal Information for direct and/or targeted marketing purposes.

**To not be subject to a decision based solely on “automated processing.”**

We are required to keep records of automated processing that we carry out, if any, and, in certain circumstances, provide you with information about the way that the decisions are made, and respond to your objections to being subject to decisions made.

We do not currently make decisions about individuals based solely on automated processing. If we engage in this activity in the future, you will have the right to object to a decision we make wholly by a computer or algorithm without human input and to receive information about this type of processing.

If you want to exercise any of these rights, please make a request to [privacy@cronometer.com](mailto:privacy@cronometer.com).
