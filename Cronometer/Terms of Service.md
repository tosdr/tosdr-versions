We offer certain premium versions of the Services (e.g. Gold Edition and Professional Edition) (the “Premium Services”) for a fee. By subscribing for any of the Premium Services, you agree to our Terms, and any additional terms and conditions that are provided here.  
  
The Premium Services provide you access to certain enhanced services, features and functionality (including, for example, a free mobile app, enhanced trends and analysis, an ad-free browsing experience, the ability to link accounts with friends, our "Ask the Oracle" which recommends best food for nutrients and priority support). By subscribing for and using the Premium Services, you agree to pay any fees or other incurred charges that apply to the Premium Services (such as subscription fees). When you subscribe for the Premium Services, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (“Payment Method”). This information must be complete and accurate, and you are responsible for keeping it up to date. You hereby expressly authorize us to collect from your Payment Method the appropriate fees charged for the Premium Services and for any other purchases you elect to make via the Premium Services. You can choose to pay for the Premium Services on a monthly, biannual or annual basis. All fees due for the Premium Services are payable in advance, and will be billed automatically to the Payment Method at the start of the monthly, biannual or annual Premium Service period, as applicable. Unless otherwise stated, Premium Services will auto-renew until you elect to cancel your access to Premium Services.  
  
When you provide any payment account information to Cronometer, you represent to Cronometer that you are the authorized user of that payment account.  
  
**(b) Termination and Cancellation of Premium Services  
**  
If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Premium Services, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Premium Services with or without notice to you.  
‍  
You may cancel your subscription to the Premium Services at any time through your Account settings or by submitting a cancellation request to us via email at: support@cronometer.com. The cancellation of a Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the Premium Service through the remainder of such billing cycle. For example, if you are billed on a monthly basis and cancel during a given month, you will be charged for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the Premium Service through the end of that month.  
  
There are no refunds for termination or cancellation of your Premium Service. Cronometer reserves the right, but without any obligation, to review its no refund policy upon request and on a case by case basis.  
  
**(c) Fee Changes  
**  
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change the fee we charge for Premium Services at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Premium Service and/or by sending you an email notification.

When you sign up for a recurring subscription, membership or other ongoing Services, you have the right to cancel the recurring arrangement in writing within seven (7) calendar days after you first entered into the recurring arrangement and you will receive a full refund of any fees paid within thirty (30) days. If however, you access, download, install or use the Services related to the recurring arrangement, you lose your right to withdraw from or cancel the recurring arrangement and your fees are non-refundable. The period for any auto-renewal or recurring arrangement will be the same as the period you originally ordered unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of purchase. The charges made in connection with any auto-renewal or recurring arrangements will also be at the same rates as were in effect at the time of your original order unless we give you prior notice of any change to such charges before such charges are made for any subsequent renewal period. If you cancel an auto-renewal or recurring arrangement after the seven (7) day cancellation period or after you have accessed, downloaded, installed or used the Services you ordered, you will not be entitled to a refund and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then current recurring period unless you request an earlier termination date in writing. Cancellation requests must be submitted by email to Cronometer at: [support@cronometer.com](mailto:support@cronometer.com)  
  
**(e) Gift, Discount or Coupon Codes  
**  
If you have received a gift, discount or coupon code (a "Code") to a Premium Service, the following terms and conditions apply in addition to the terms and conditions of the specific Code. To redeem a Code, log in to the applicable edition and enter the applicable Code in the subscription process. All Codes can only be applied to Accounts that are not already subscribing to Premium Services. Codes cannot be exchanged, refunded or redeemed for cash or payment of Accounts. You are responsible to use a Code before it expires and expired Codes cannot be refunded or extended. You are also responsible for cancelling or terminating the Premium Service before the end of the free or a discounted period if you do not want to continue with the Premium Service at the regular price. Cronometer may cancel Codes at any time without any liability or responsibility to compensate the Code holder whatsoever.

**( c ) Alleged Copyright Infringement Policy  
**  
It is Cronometer’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that are made in compliance with the United States _Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998_ (the “DMCA”)_._ If you wish to provide notice of alleged copyright infringement, you must provide the necessary information in the form required by 17 U.S.C. Section 512 (c) and in accordance with the provisions set out below. Cronometer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate or suspend access to the Site, and/or Services or any portion thereof, and/or cancel the Account of any user who repeatedly infringes or who is repeatedly alleged to have infringed the copyright or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Cronometer accommodates and does not interfere with standard digital rights management and other technical measures employed by copyright owners to protect their proprietary materials.  
  
Cronometer requires all notices of alleged copyright infringement (a “Copyright Notice”) to be in writing and delivered via regular mail, e-mail or fax to Cronometer or its agent in order to enable us to review and respond to your complaint as efficiently as possible while maintaining compliance with applicable laws. If you are providing a Copyright Notice under the DMCA, you must provide the detailed information outlined below. You should also be aware that, under the DMCA, you could be held liable for damages (including any costs and attorney’s fees) if you materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing your copyright. If you are not certain whether the material or activity about which you are complaining infringes your copyright, you should obtain competent legal advice. If you are not subject to the laws of the United States or the infringing content is not hosted in the United States, the DMCA may not apply. If you are not certain whether the DMCA applies, you should obtain competent legal advice. The full text of the DMCA is available from the United States Copyright Office website at: http://www.copyright.gov/
