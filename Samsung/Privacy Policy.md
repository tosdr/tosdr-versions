Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Samsung”), know how important privacy is to our customers. This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we may obtain online across all of our Internet-connected Samsung devices and services (from mobile phones and tablets to TVs, home appliances, online services, and more)(collectively, our “Services”), and how we may use and disclose that information. We also explain the choices available to you regarding our use of the information, the steps we take to safeguard the information, and how you how may [contact us](#pp_12) Children’s Personal Information if you have any questions about our privacy practices.

If you are a California resident, click [here](#pp_06) to view our Notice To California Residents for information provided pursuant to California law.

**Information We Obtain**

We may obtain the following personal information about you when you interact with us, including but not limited to when you purchase a Samsung product, create a Samsung Account, register for or use a Service, contact Customer Support, visit a Samsung retail location, or while attending an event:

    • contact information (including your name, email address, postal address, and phone number);  
    • payment card information (including your name, card number, expiration date, and security code);  
    • user coupon or gift card number;  
    • date of birth;  
    • demographic data (e.g., gender and age range);  
    • information you provide when you apply for credit or financing, such as your social security number;  
    • information stored in or associated with your Samsung Account (including your Samsung Account profile, ID, username, and password);  
    • username and password for participating third-party devices, apps, features, or services;  
    • information you store on your device, such as photos, contacts, text logs, and calendar information, when you back-up your device or use a feature that requires collection (such as when you share it with other users);  
    • recordings of your voice when you use voice commands to control a Service, or when you contact our Customer Service team;  
    • transcripts of chat sessions, text messages, emails, and other communications when you communicate with us using these methods;  
    • information about products and services you purchase, obtain, or consider; and  
    • location data (including (1) the precise geolocation of your device if you consent to the collection of this data and (2) information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services).  

We may obtain certain information about you from publicly or commercially-available sources and from third parties who perform services for us. We also may obtain other information about you, your devices, and your use of the Services, in ways we describe at the time we collect the information or otherwise with your consent.

  
        _Information We Collect Automatically_  
  

Our Services collect some data automatically when you use the Services. We may obtain information by automated means such as through browser cookies, pixels, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. Among other purposes, these technologies help us (1) remember your information so you will not have to re-enter it, (2) track and understand how you use and interact with the Services, (3) tailor the Services around your preferences, (4) manage and measure the usability of the Services, (5) understand the effectiveness of our communications, and (6) otherwise enhance the Services.

Information we may collect automatically includes information about  
    • your device, including MAC address, IP address, log information, device model, hardware model, IMEI number, serial number, subscription information, device settings, connections to other devices, mobile network operator, web browser characteristics, app usage information, sales code, access code, current software version, MNC, subscription information, and randomized, non-persistent and resettable device identifiers, such as Personalized Service ID (or PSID), and advertising IDs, including Google Ad ID;  
    • your use of the Services, including clickstream data, your interactions with the Services (such as the web pages you visit, search terms, and the apps, services and features you use, download, or purchase), the pages that lead or refer you to the Services, how you use the Services, and dates and times of use of the Services; and  
    • your use of third-party websites, apps and features that are connected to certain Services.  
  

Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser’s menu or visiting [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. Please note that without cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from all of the features of our Services.

            _**Information Stored on Your Device Not Accessible to Samsung**_  

In addition to the categories of information obtained by Samsung discussed above, our Services may generate data automatically when you use certain Services (e.g. Samsung’s face-clustering technology that allows the device to group together images of the same face from different photographs (“Face-Clustering Data”)), or may utilize data that you generate independently (e.g. registering biometric data such as fingerprints to unlock your device or verify you in certain Services, or when you register your wake-up command in our Bixby Voice service). All of this data remains on the device and is not transmitted to Samsung, nor does Samsung obtain or access this data. Samsung does not share this data with third parties. Face-Clustering Data will remain on your device until you clear the cache in your system settings, you reset your device to its factory setting, or you delete the photos from your device. You can delete your registered biometric data or your wake-up command from your device at any time in the applicable settings. Because Samsung does not have access to this data, Samsung cannot delete it.

            _**Third-Party Web Analytics Services**_  

Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services or help administer the Services. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To learn more about Firebase Analytics, please visit [https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics/](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics/).

            **_Online Tracking And Interest-Based Advertising_**  

Through certain Services, both we and various third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.

_Samsung Ads_  

Our Samsung Ads service is designed to serve advertisements that are customized to users’ interests on Samsung and third-party platforms, devices, websites, and apps. Samsung Ads may deliver customized ads based on your demographic characteristics, preferences, choices, and interests by collecting certain information about your online activities as specified in this Privacy Policy. Please see the Samsung Ads Privacy Notice [https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads/](https://www.samsung.com/us/account/privacy-policy/samsungads/) for more information, including information on how to opt out of receiving customized ads from Samsung Ads.

_Ad networks_  

Because Samsung participates in various advertising networks, you may also see our ads on other websites or mobile apps. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users’ inferred interests, and browsing context. These networks can track users’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, pixels, device identifiers, server logs, and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals’ interests, to track users’ browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users’ online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users’ visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on certain Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

To learn how to opt out of ad network interest-based advertising in the U.S., please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) and [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

**How We Use the Information We Obtain**

We may use the personal information we obtain to:

    • provide and enhance our Services, such as registering you or your device for a Service, identifying and authenticating you so you may use and interact with our Services (such as your device) and third-party services,managing our financing programs, and improving and customizing your experience within the Services;  
    • provide ads, which may include targeted (or interest-based) ads delivered on your Samsung device or within certain Samsung-branded apps (where targeted or interest-based ads are available, if you turn off targeted or interest-based ads, you will receive generic ads);  
    • support our marketing activities and sales initiatives, and provide you with product and service recommendations;  
    • communicate with you;  
    • provide customer support;  
    • operate, evaluate, and improve our business, including developing new products and services, managing our communications, analyzing our Services and customer base, conducting market research, aggregating and anonymizing data, performing data analytics, and undertaking accounting, auditing, and other internal functions;  
    • protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities; and  
    • comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards, and our policies, including this Privacy Policy and the applicable Terms of Use for a Service.  

We may combine information we obtain about you for the purposes described above. We also may use the information we obtain in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection or otherwise with your consent.

**Information Sharing**

We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates and with service providers who perform services for us. We do not authorize our service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may share your personal information with our business partners, such as wireless carriers, financing partners when you apply for and use credit or financing programs, and third parties who operate apps and services that connect with certain Services. This kind of sharing may be considered a “sale” under certain state privacy laws.

We may share personal information we collect through the Services if you ask us to do so or otherwise with your consent. We also may disclose information about you in other circumstances, including:

    • to law enforcement authorities, government or public agencies or officials, regulators, and/or any other person or entity with appropriate legal authority or justification for receipt of such information, if required or permitted to do so by law or legal process;  
    • when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity; or  
    • in the event we may or do sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution, or liquidation).  
  
**Links to Other Websites, Devices, Apps, And Features**

The Services may provide the ability to connect to other websites, devices, apps, and other features, which may operate independently from us and may have their own privacy notices or policies. We strongly suggest you review them. To the extent any linked website, device, app, or other feature is not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for its content, use, or privacy practices.

**Your Rights and Choices**

We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information we obtain about you.
