1. **Eligibility:** Use of the Service is void where prohibited. The Service is for users of all ages. For children younger than 13, Quizizz offers a limited feature set and does not require Quizizz to obtain parental consent.

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and, (c) your use of the Service does not violate any applicable law or regulation.

Quizizz will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. Quizizz may from time to time set storage limits for your data, or take any other measures Quizizz considers appropriate to manage the Service. Quizizz may also from time to time change its policies on offering commercial content or displaying advertising, and it may do this without notice.

That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, computer software or any other format in which Quizizz stores data.
