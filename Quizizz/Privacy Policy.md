### Guiding Principles

##### Respecting your privacy is critically important to achieving our mission of motivating every student. These are our guiding privacy principles:

* We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
* We don’t keep your personal data, personal information or personally identifiable information (PII) (collectively referred to as “personal information”) longer than is necessary to provide our services to you.
* We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, provide our services, or protect our rights.
* We don’t rent, sell or exchange your personal information.
* We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is (a) visible to the public, (b) seen by third-party search engines, browsers, platforms, websites, apps, or processors, (c) kept private, and (d) permanently deleted.

  

### General

This **Privacy Policy and Notice** (referred to herein as **Privacy Policy**) applies to users of the Quizizz platform and describes how Quizizz collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects your personally identifiable information and how you can access, update, delete, limit, and otherwise halt the use of this information.

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information, including the option to use services without providing personal information. More details can be found in our [Quizizz Privacy Center.](https://quizizz.com/home/privacy-center?lng=en)  
  

Your use of the Quizizz services, website, and applications constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy and Notice, and your consent to Quizizz handling your personal data and information under these terms.

We strive to support as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. If a screen reader makes this policy more accessible to you, we recommend the following browser and screen reader combinations: Chrome and ChromeVox, Safari and VoiceOver (for Mac users), and Firefox and NVDA (for Windows users).

  

### Section 1. Protecting Students and their Personal Information

Quizizz believes the personally identifiable information of children and students deserves special protections and we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the general consumer data privacy and student advertising limitation laws of US states and The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). We also assist schools in meeting their obligations pursuant to the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (“FERPA”).

Quizizz offers a limited feature set and website experience for young users of Quizizz. We do not require students to submit their name or contact information, nor do we require them to create accounts. When a student indicates that they are under the age when they can grant consent on their own, Quizizz does not collect personal information as defined under COPPA and may take additional steps to safeguard student privacy as required by law. Except as described in this privacy policy, Quizizz does not accumulate personal information about any child for distribution, sharing, or selling.

Here are some examples of safety and privacy measures on Quizizz:

* Students do not receive behaviorally targeted advertising.
* Students can join games without creating an account.
* The platform does not facilitate direct messaging between students.
* Quizzes are subject to proactive content filters and reactive reporting tools.

  

### Section 2. Parental Rights and Consents

**Quizizz empowers parents and legal guardians of children younger than the age of consent** (in the U.S., this means under 13) who have registered accounts with Quizizz, to exercise their legal rights pursuant to legislation such as COPPA. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use by Quizizz of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties by Quizizz. Currently, the only personally identifiable information we collect from a child younger than the age of consent in any of the jurisdictions we operate in is their parent's or guardian’s email address. We may also collect a student’s first name, which alone is generally not PII but may be considered personal information in a generic sense.  
  

Parents/guardians may delete, modify, and review information their children shared with Quizizz by accessing their child's account. They may also create a parent account to manage their child’s access to Quizizz. Parents may also request that Quizizz delete that information and refuse to allow Quizizz to collect further information from their children by deleting their account at

[quizizz.com/settings](http://quizizz.com/settings) or otherwise contacting us at [privacy@quizizz.com.](mailto: privacy@quizizz.com) Quizizz may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.

As necessary, Quizizz ensures that there is verifiable parental consent for children younger than the age of consent in any jurisdiction.

Quizizz offers consent options to parents so that users (or parents/ guardians) can consent to the collection and use of personal information necessary to provide the service without consenting to the use or disclosure of that information to third parties for other purposes (e.g., marketing).

Quizizz will never require a child to share more information than is reasonably necessary for using Quizizz. Quizizz uses, discloses and retains personal information only for the purpose of providing the classroom web app/software/service.

While Quizizz will assign persistent identifiers to all Quizizz users to recognize repeat visitors and improve their Quizizz experience, Quizizz does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than the age of consent without a parent or guardian's consent. If we become aware, despite our intention not to gather this information, that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child younger than the age of consent without permission, then we will seek to obtain verifiable parental consent from the child’s parent or guardian to collect and use that data to provide the child with Quizizz services in the future; or, if consent is not provided, we will delete this information.

  

### Section 3. Information Quizizz Collects

#### 3.1. Sensitive Information

As described above, we limit data collection to what we need to provide the requested services. Quizizz does not knowingly collect data that is considered or defined as sensitive under any relevant country and state laws including COPPA, FERPA, CCPA, and other laws of the US, GDPR, and related laws in the EU, UK, Switzerland, and EEA, and similar laws in Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries in which Quizizz provides its service, such as those related to race or ethnicity, health and biometric information, or political affiliation. In addition to these categories, we do not collect free or reduced lunch eligibility.

#### 3.2 Information You Provide to Quizizz

Accounts are not a prerequisite to using Quizizz, but are required to access some features and to save progress over time. If you create an account, Quizizz saves the account information you provide. This information may include: an email address, a parent or guardian email address, first name, last name, profile photo, or organization name.

Student profiles and activity within the Quizizz app and service are kept private and cannot be seen or collected by others unless their use of the app/service itself is collaborative and requires this type of sharing.

You may choose not to provide specific information or to delete or modify it at any time. These actions may prevent you from engaging with specific services or features that require this information. Additional information may be provided to Quizizz if you communicate with our support team, participate in user research, marketing campaigns or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the services.

If you engage in a financial transaction with Quizizz, we do not process or store this information beyond the transaction. Financial transactions are processed via a PCI-compliant payment provider and data is not stored by Quizizz.

As you use the service, you may also create academic content including quizzes and certain forms of responses. This information is not typically personally identifying, but it may be deleted at any time either by the relevant account holder or by reaching out to our team at [support@quizizz.com.](mailto: support@quizizz.com)

#### 3.3. Information Collected Automatically

We receive and store some types of information about how users visit our site and the devices they use automatically as you use the service. These may include device information such as device model, operating system, and device identifiers such as IDFA and UDID and network information.

Quizizz does not collect any personal information covertly, i.e., without the user’s knowledge, particularly audio/video information via the user’s own device.

Quizizz also collects log information as you use the service. These data may include information regarding how and when you use the service as well as your browser type, preferred language, time zone, referring site, log-in and log-out times, and internet protocol (IP) address.

We may use your IP address to generate a general approximation of your location to provide the service. Examples include providing the right version of Quizizz based on your state or country and helping teachers select their school when they sign up. Quizizz does not collect fine location data such as GPS or bluetooth beacons.

We use Google Analytics to help us understand how users engage with the service. Google Analytics uses cookies to compile reports that demonstrate how Quizizz is being used without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics at any time and continue to use Quizizz. To learn more about opting out, click [here.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Aggregated demographic and activity data may be used for research purposes.

  

### Section 4. Information We Store; Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We conduct periodic reviews of accounts and may delete accounts that have been inactive for extended periods of time, normally not sooner than one year.

We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

You may delete your account or update your information at any time by visiting [www.quizizz.com/settings.](https://quizizz.com/www.quizizz.com/settings)  
  

### Section 5. Information Shared with Third Parties

As described in this policy, Quizizz only shares your personal information when it is necessary to offer the service, comply with law, or with your permission.

#### 5.1. Third-Party Services that May Process Your Quizizz Personal Data

In order to provide and improve Quizizz, a limited number of third-party services require access to your personal information. For example, your account data are saved in a data center so that you can log in from any device. Third-party services are contractually prohibited from using your information except to provide the service. [A link to the table of the identity and type of our third party service providers,](https://support.quizizz.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037910691-Subprocessors-and-Service-Providers-Used-by-Quizizz)the purposes for which we use them and how they use and process personal data on our behalf can be found [here.](https://support.quizizz.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037910691-Subprocessors-and-Service-Providers-Used-by-Quizizz)

#### 5.2. Information from Other Third-Party Sources

Depending on how you use the service, we may also receive your personal information from another user, with a Quizizz educational account, under the Quizizz terms and conditions. For example, a teacher might input your email in order to share a quiz or parent report. If a teacher chooses to enter student information directly into Quizizz or requires students to sign up via the Google Classroom Integration, Classes on Quizizz, or a similar rostering functionality, teachers and schools are requested to get parental consent before using Quizizz with children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own. A link to a usable template permission slip is available [here.](https://support.quizizz.com/hc/en-us/articles/23346678264857-Permission-Slip-Template-for-Teachers)

Content on Quizizz may contain links to other websites not affiliated with the service. While we review the privacy and security practices of third-party companies who assist us in providing you with our site and services, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites and users need to be aware of the data privacy practices of such sites should they choose to use these links.

#### 5.3. Third Party Cloud Provider: Amazon Web Services

Quizizz utilizes the services and infrastructure of outside parties to host its data. Quizizz holds those providers to a standard at least as protective of student data as the measures outlined in this policy. Our main cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the largest data hosting company and has leading practices in security standards and personnel in place to constantly monitor this area. A link to AWS’s Privacy Center can be found [here.](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy/)

#### 5.4. Google and Youtube API Services as Third-Party Provider

Google application programming interface (“API”) Services, including Google Sign-In, are part of an authentication and authorization framework that gives Quizizz, the ability to connect directly with Google users by requesting access to Google user data. The [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms) govern the use of Google API Services when Quizizz requests access to Google user data.

Quizizz commits to adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including its Limited Use requirements, for any data received from Google APIs. For more details, visit [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms), [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy). Please check back from time to time as these policies are occasionally updated.  
  

Quizizz may collect information from partners and integrated technologies. For example, if you choose to use Google Login or join using the Google Classroom integration, we may receive information including your name and email address from Google. Quizizz does not have access to the passwords used to log into your Google accounts.

Quizizz also uses API Services of Google’s affiliated company, Youtube. Quizizz further commits to adhere to the[YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and to [YouTube’s Developer Policies.](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies-guide)YouTube’s privacy practices govern the collection, use, and storage of user information by the YouTube API. By using Quizizz services, you acknowledge and agree to [YouTube’s Terms of Service.](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms)When an individual or user makes use of or accesses YouTube (whether through the YouTube API Services or otherwise), any use or access is governed by YouTube’s Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy. Quizizz YouTube integrations use data and have access to information necessary for completing the project using YouTube. As the provider of YouTube API, Google’s privacy practices also govern the collection, use, and storage of user information by the YouTube API. By using Quizizz services, you further acknowledge and agree to the [Google Privacy Policy.](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

#### 5.5. Opt-Out Option

In order to use Quizizz services, you may opt out of any information transfer that is not strictly necessary to run the service, such as our data hosting cloud provider. However, all of our third-party providers adhere to strict data security standards. Generally, if any of our non-foundational suppliers are changed, you will not be notified. However, in the event of a change that has a material impact on how your data is shared, we will notify you by the same type of login notice detailed later in this policy, under the section on changes to the policy.

You have the right to delete, access, update, correct errors in, and export for transfer any of your personal information. Quizizz makes these data subject rights available to you regardless of which country or US state you reside in. Please see further detail below in section 11.2.

#### 5.6. Other Third-Party Details

Third-party services that transfer the personal information of EU residents are contractually bound to comply with GDPR. GDPR-specific information can be found in this Privacy Policy and Notice in Section 15 below.

Quizizz may need to disclose your information to a third party to comply with the law or a valid legal request. In such cases, we will let you know in advance, unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.

If Quizizz (or substantially all of its assets) are acquired by another company, personal information will be transferred to a new owner. In such a transfer, you will be notified and the new owner may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Quizizz may aggregate statistics about the behavior of visitors to our website and app to improve our services. For instance, Quizizz may monitor the most popular quizzes on the Quizizz site. Quizizz may display this information publicly or provide it to others.

  

### Section 6. How Quizizz Collects Minimum Necessary Personal Information

Quizizz collects only the personal information required to operate its classroom web apps, software and services. It does not access browser history, contact lists, search terms, preferences, device identification, location, etc. unless directly related to providing the service.

Quizizz does not condition a child's participation in a game, the offering of a prize, or ability to participate in any other activity on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

The information that Quizizz collects depends on the nature of the services you request. For example, fewer data are collected from a student joining a game without an account than from a teacher who creates an account in order to create quizzes and host games. Educators using Quizizz may create generic accounts or profiles for children using as little personal information as possible.

All interactions with the Quizizz website or app produce metadata that may identify you or could be identifiable information when paired with other information about you. In every case, Quizizz strives to collect only the minimum necessary information from you as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizizz or that is required by law. Visitors to the Quizizz website or app may always refuse to supply personally identifying information, however, doing so may prevent you from engaging in certain website-related activities.
