#### Delivery Turn-around Time

##### Over the counter items:

These orders are processed in 24 – 72 business hours, given stock is available on hand.

##### Prescription items:

These items require confirmation by your prescribing veterinarian. We generally contact vets within 24 business hours of  
the order being placed. We request that vets respond to the request within 24 hours, but sometimes the process can take longer, depending on the veterinarian. Once confirmation is received the order will be processed and shipped within 24 – 72 business hours.

#### Overnight Deliveries

Overnight shipping starts at $39.99 and must be within the United States. Packages are shipped via FedEx. The fee can increase Depending on final destination. The cut-off time for overnight orders is 1:00pm Pacific Time. Street address must be provided for delivery. There may be additional charges added due to the weight of the package or delivery zone limitations. Overnight orders placed on a Friday will arrive the next business day. If you place an order on a Friday and want it delivered on Saturday, you will have to request a special Saturday delivery which has a different price scale from the standard overnight fee. FedEx does not guarantee overnight deliveries if the package undergoes inclement weather. CPP is not responsible for any packages that undergo inclement weather delays. It is the client’s responsibility to be aware of the weather conditions in their area. Please refer to our [Inclement Weather Policy](https://www.californiapetpharmacy.com/company/policies#weather) above for more information.

#### Packages that must go FedEx Ground

We ship the majority of our packages via USPS. However, if the total weight of the package is over 2 pounds, it will ship via FedEx Ground. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) prevents us from air-shipping items that may cause a hazard.

This includes:

* aerosol-type products
* flammable and certain liquids.

As a result, these items are unable to ship Priority or Overnight and must go FedEx Ground, which may take longer to arrive.

#### Food Items

We currently cannot ship pet food to Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories. Food items have their own shipping charges separate from our standard shipping rates. Food does not qualify for free shipping.

| Weight | Price (in USD) |
| --- | --- |
| 4 – 10 lbs. | $12.99 |
| 11 – 20 lbs. | $18.99 |
| 21 – 30 lbs. | $28.99 |
| 31 – 40 lbs. | $33.99 |
| 40 lbs. + | Please Contact Us |

#### Shipping for Vaccines and Products that Require Refrigeration

Orders that contain vaccines and products that require refrigeration are shipped via FedEx Next Day and must be shipped Monday-Thursday. There will be an additional shipping fee. Vaccines and products that require refrigeration are non-returnable, non-refundable, and do not qualify for free shipping. All vaccines and products that require refrigeration will be shipped in insulated containers with ice packs.

#### Additional Shipping Fees

Free shipping does not qualify for items that require an extra shipping fee. All items that require additional shipping fees are indicated on their product pages. Additional shipping fees will include, but are not limited to the following:

* Orders with bulk items will require a quote for FedEx ground shipping

#### Auto-Ship Program Policy

The Auto-Ship Program is designed for clients who want to have recurring orders shipped out without calling in or placing orders online. To qualify for the prescription Auto-Ship, the current or new prescription must have 3 or more refills included.

Those 3 refills must be used within the year before the expiration. Prescription Auto-Ship orders are given a 5% discount.  
If you have a current order and request and qualify for the program, the 5% discount application will start on your next order (the first Auto-Ship order). Over-the-counter Auto-Ship orders are not given a discount. The frequency of the auto-shipments cannot exceed 3 months. Frequencies cannot be drastically adjusted and clients are allowed only one frequency change within the year. We’re able to adjust the frequency up to 15 days. We are able to pause Auto-Ship if needed. You must contact us to pause Auto-Ship and inform us of when you’re ready to reinstate the account. If the Auto-Ship account has been paused for 3 or more months, we will remove your account from Auto-Ship. If you’d like to add multiple pets or medications to your Auto-Ship, you must choose one frequency in which all the medications will ship out. Every client is allowed one frequency for their Auto-Ship account. If you’d like to add a medication for a one-time shipment to your Auto-Ship order, we’d be able to add it, however, that item will not receive a discount. Before all your refills are used or your prescription expires, we will contact your veterinarian to authorize another prescription or inform you to mail in another prescription so we can continue your auto-shipments. The Auto-Ship Program is ongoing unless you inform us to cancel or pause it. Additionally, if the new prescription we receive does not have 3 or more refills included, you will no longer qualify for the Auto-Ship program and your account will be removed. For any requests or inquiries for the Auto-Ship Program, please contact our customer service department at [877.554.4797](tel:+18775544797).

#### Discrepancy Policy

Clients must contact CPP of any discrepancies or damages within 24 hours of receipt of the medication.

#### Return Policy

An order for a prescription item must be canceled before shipping. **We can not accept returns of prescription items.** Please reference the following link to learn more.

#### Inclement Weather Policy

If you live in a region that exhibits extreme hot or cold temperatures we recommend you choose the express overnight shipping method. California Pet Pharmacy is not responsible if the content(s) of your package undergo inclement weather as this is out of our control. It is the client’s responsibility to consider current inclement weather conditions when ordering medications. If arrangements need to be made on a particular shipping service or shipping method, it is the client’s responsibility to contact our customer service line at [877.554.4797](tel:+18775544797) to discuss how we can help make arrangements.Additional charges may be applied at that time.

Please Note: Most prescription products require storage at room temperature unless otherwise stated.

#### Ship to Billing Address Policy

We require all clients to ship to the billing address associated with their credit card due to security reasons. This policy only applies to the _first order_ if it includes over-the-counter items. This does not apply to returning clients or orders with prescription items. If your order is placed with the shipping and billing address mismatched, you will be contacted by one of our customer service representatives for further information.
