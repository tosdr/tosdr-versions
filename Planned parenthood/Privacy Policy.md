We may also share personal information with third parties.  Our disclosure practices include the following: 

1. **Other Planned Parenthood Organizations**: We work together with, and may share your personal information with other Planned Parenthood Organizations, to create a coherent experience for Planned Parenthood supporters and the public, and to maximize our impact nationwide. Each Planned Parenthood Organization is its own separate organization with its own policies, procedures, and practices, some of which may be shared on their respective websites. When we share your personal information with any other Planned Parenthood Organization directly, their own privacy practices and operations govern how they process your personal information. For more information about how each Planned Parenthood Organization processes your personal information, please review their respective privacy notices. 
2. **Partner Organizations:** To enable more effective advocacy and organizing, we often partner with other organizations to further the reach of our work. We may share your personal information with our partner organizations to further those efforts and bolster our respective capacities for furthering our missions. 
3. **No Shared Mobile Consent:** When you consent to us contacting you via text message, we do not treat that as consent to be contacted by text by any other party, nor is any other party authorized to contact you by text based on that consent.

These parties may collect information directly from a browser or device when an individual visits our Services through cookies or other data collection technologies. This information is used to provide and inform targeted advertising, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. For more information on steps that you can take to protect your digital privacy in relation to abortion related information and services, please consult the educational material published by Digital Defense Fund, “[Guide to Abortion Privacy](https://digitaldefensefund.org/ddf-guides/abortion-privacy).” For additional information on ad networks and advertising partners, please see the **Third-Party Data Collection and Online Advertising** section.

#### **3\. THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING**

We may display targeted advertisements to you on third-party websites and social media sites, such as Facebook and Instagram, to fundraise and build support for our advocacy, organizing, and education priorities.  We may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of our online services over time so that they may play or display ads on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Information used for targeted advertisements may be collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, AdID, precise geolocation, and other information. 

Targeted advertisements help us reach people who are most likely to take action or have interest in our Services or mission. In doing so, we may share your personal information with third-party advertisers to serve targeted advertisements to specific individuals, or to display ads to people who are similar to individuals who have engaged with us. These practices help us engage in effective advocacy, education, and organizing operations, support our fundraising efforts, and enable our teams to communicate more effectively with known and prospective supporters.

Specifically, we may engage in the following: 

1. **Social Media Widgets and Advertising**.  Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, Pinterest, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Services, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.
2. **Social Media Platforms.** We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter), Instagram, and other social media platforms. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Services, including our advocacy and organizing work, while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our Site visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks. 
3. **Third Party Partners**.  We work with a variety of third-party partners to provide advertising services. For example, we use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our Services on your browser or mobile device, log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us.  We share a unique but anonymized identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you.  For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's website, “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
4. We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services.  You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at  [https://google.com/ads/preferences](https://google.com/ads/preferences%2520), or by visiting Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources at  [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). For more information about these practices and your choices regarding cookies, please refer to the **Control Over Your Information** section here below. 

To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources, at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices)  or [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android).  You may also be able to opt-out of some — but not all — interest-based advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. 

Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online Services. Rather, it means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.

  
 

#### **4\. CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION**

You may control your information in the following ways:

1. **Email Communications Preferences.**  You can stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided in such communications.  You may not opt-out of service-related communications (e.g., account verification, transactional communications, changes/updates to features of the Services, technical and security notices).
2. **Direct Mailings**.  From time to time, we may send you direct mail with information about issues and opportunities we think may be of interest to you. If you'd like to remove your address from future mailings, you may opt out at any time by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please include your name and physical address, so that we can remove you from our direct mailings list.  Please note, this opt-out does not affect any mailings that we facilitate on behalf of our third-party partners, so you may still receive direct mail sent by our third-party partners or others. You should contact the third-party partners to ask to be removed from any of their marketing, email, or mailing lists.
3. **Modifying or Deleting Your Information.**  If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting your information, you can contact us directly at [\[email protected\]](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.

**5\. DATA RETENTION**

We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and in accordance with our legitimate business interests and applicable law. However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority.

To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.

Once retention of the personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible.

#### **6\. DATA DE-IDENTIFICATION**

To minimize the data in our possession, we may de-identify personal information when identifying information is no longer needed. We may also de-identify information to remove identifying information from records that must be retained for legal purposes, including when you request that we delete your information. When we de-identify information, we will use it only in its de-identified form and will not attempt to re-identify the information.

#### **7\. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, including by, for example, securing donation forms with encryption. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.  In the event that we become aware that personal information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the incident and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised, and take other steps, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

#### **8\. CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Our Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If an individual is under the age of 13, they should not use our Services or otherwise provide us with any personal information. If a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we encourage the child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that we remove the child’s personal information from our systems. If we learn that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that personal information.  
 

#### **9\. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES OR SERVICES**

Our Services may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Except where we post, link to, or expressly adopt or refer to this Privacy Notice, this Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, any personal information practices of third-party websites or services. To learn about the personal information practices of third parties, please visit their respective privacy notices. 

#### **10\. CALIFORNIA SHINE THE LIGHT DISCLOSURE**

The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined under the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To opt out of this type of sharing, please complete our [Individual Rights Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSNwlfZsYpDHEHknCmOUDGY5xs-imWDsBLVQDiyxUvjKf3YQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0).  
  
 

#### **11\. UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE**

The categories of third parties to whom we disclose your personal information for a business purpose may include: 

A. Service providers and advisors that perform services for us, on our behalf, which may include providing marketing and advertising services, providing mailing or email services, tax and accounting services, data enhancement services, fraud prevention, web hosting, or similar services;

This practice may be interpreted to constitute a “sale” under the Colorado or Oregon state privacy law or may constitute the “sharing” or processing of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes (targeted advertising) under the same. Unless you have exercised your right to opt-out, we may disclose or “sell” your personal information, or “share” your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.

**7\. How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights** 

Please submit a request by either:

* Completing our [**Individual Rights Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSNwlfZsYpDHEHknCmOUDGY5xs-imWDsBLVQDiyxUvjKf3YQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0); or
* Calling 1-800-430-4907

Before processing your request, we will need to verify your identity and confirm that you are a resident of Colorado or Oregon. To verify your identity, we will generally require matching a minimum amount of information you provide us with the information we maintain about you in our systems. This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address and phone number.

In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.

**8\. To Exercise Your Opt-Out Rights**

To exercise your right to opt-out of the “selling” or “sharing” of certain types of information, you may complete our [Individual Rights Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSNwlfZsYpDHEHknCmOUDGY5xs-imWDsBLVQDiyxUvjKf3YQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) or call 1-800-430-4907. 

You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your right to opt out. However, we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify you in our dataset and to track compliance with your opt out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not to provide this information, we may only be able to process your request to the extent we are able to identify you in our data systems.

Unless you exercise your right to opt out as described above, we may “sell” your personal information with third parties for “other valuable consideration” and we may “share” your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes (targeted advertising), as qualified in Section 3 above. The third parties to whom we share personal information may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy policies.

_Submitting Authorized Agent Requests._ In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit an “opt out” request on your behalf through the designated methods set forth above where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided and whether you are a Colorado or Oregon resident, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request.
