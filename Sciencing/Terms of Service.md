9. Customer Service. We have no obligation to provide you with customer support of any kind. However, we may provide you with customer support from time to time, at our sole discretion.
10. Good Samaritan Third-Party Policy & Complaint Procedures.

1. Policy. We do not tolerate any acts of intellectual property violations or allow for any child pornography or obscene or defamatory Material to be posted on this Site. We will do our best, in good faith, to remove, disable or restrict access to, or the availability of, Material that, in our subjective view, is infringing, racist, obscene as to minors, child pornography, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violate, harassing, or otherwise objectionable. The provisions of this Section 8 are intended to implement this policy but are not intended to impose a contractual obligation on us to undertake, or refrain from undertaking, any particular course of action.
2. Complaint Procedures. If you believe that someone has posted Material that violates this policy (other than in cases of copyright infringement, which is addressed in Section 9), we ask you to promptly notify us by email at the following address: [\[email protected\]](https://sciencing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) . You _must_ use this address if you want to ensure that your complaint is actually received by the appropriate person charged with investigating alleged policy violations. Please provide us with sufficient detail in your complaint to allow us to effectively respond. At a minimum, please include (i) the nature of the offending Material or right infringed; (ii) all the facts that lead you to believe this policy has been violated or a right has been infringed; (iii) the precise location where the offending Material is located; (iv) in the case of infringement, any grounds that make you believe that the person who posted the Material was not authorized to do so; and, if (v) if known, the identity of the person or persons who posted the infringing or offending Material.
3. Indemnification; Waiver of Certain Rights. By lodging a complaint, you agree that the substance of your complaint will be deemed to constitute a representation made under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California. In addition, you agree, at your own expense, to defend and indemnify us and hold us harmless against all claims which may be asserted against us, and all losses incurred, as a result of your complaint and/or our response to it.
4. Waiver of Claims and Remedies. We expect visitors to take responsibility for their own actions and cannot assume liability for any acts of third parties that take place at this Site. By taking advantage of the Good Samaritan procedures set forth in this Section 8, you waive any and all claims or remedies which you might otherwise be able to assert against us under any theory of law (including, but not limited to, intellectual property laws) that arise out of or relate in any way to the Material at this Site or our response, or failure to respond, to a complaint.
5. Investigation/Liability Limitation. You agree that we have the right (but not the obligation) to investigate any complaint received. By reserving this right, we do not undertake any responsibility in fact to investigate complaints or to remove, disable or restrict access to or the availability of the Material. We support free speech on the Internet and therefore will not act on complaints that we believe, in our subjective judgment, to be deficient. If you believe that Material remains on this Site that violates your rights, your sole remedy will be against the person(s) responsible for posting or storing it, not against us.

12. DMCA Compliance.

If you believe that we have provided a link to a site that contains infringing or illegal content, or which makes available password cracker tools or other circumvention devices, we ask that you notify us so that we may evaluate whether (in our sole discretion) to disable it.
15. Unsolicited Email, Spamming & Spoofing. You may not use this Site to transmit unsolicited email. You may not send unsolicited email to this Site or to anyone whose email address includes the domain name used on this Site or our domain name. You may not use our domain name as a pseudonymous return email address for any communications which you transmit from another location or through another service.

16. Violations/Indemnification. Your access privileges to the Site are conditioned on your adherence to the terms of this Agreement. If you violate any terms of this Agreement, you agree that we may deny you access to the Site.

1. In General. Our employees are not authorized to vary the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement may be modified only by obtaining our written consent in a notarized agreement.
2. Periodic Revisions. You agree that we may modify the terms of this Agreement in our sole discretion, without advance notice, and that your right to access this Site is conditioned on an ongoing basis with your compliance with the then-current version of this Agreement. We will post a notice on this page for thirty (30) days following any revisions or modifications to this Agreement. You agree to review this page at least once every thirty (30) days. It will be your responsibility to review this page for possible modifications.

31. Arbitration. All disputes arising out of this Agreement (including its formation, performance or alleged breach) or your use of our Site or services will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration. If you can demonstrate that arbitration in California would create an undue burden to you, you are free to initiate the arbitration in your home state. Otherwise, the arbitration hearings will be held in Los Angeles County, California before and in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. You may download or copy a form notice at [**www.adr.org**](https://www.adr.org/) . If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fees. The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement will be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in the state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California to enforce these terms or prevent infringement of a third party’s rights. In the event equitable relief is sought, each party irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such court.
32. Waiver of Class Action Rights. By entering into this Agreement, you hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to join claims with those of others in the form of a class action or similar procedural device. Any claims arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement must be individually asserted.
33. Limitation of Actions. You acknowledge and agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, relating to, or connected with your use of the Site or any related services, must be filed within one (1) calendar year after such claim or cause of action arises, or forever be barred.
34. Additional Terms. This Agreement will be binding upon each party hereto and its successors and permitted assigns, and governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Los Angeles, California without reference to conflict of law principles. This Agreement and all of your rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, your account, if any) will not be assignable or transferable by you without our prior written consent. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement. We are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, all of which will remain in full force and effect.
