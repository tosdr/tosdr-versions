Privacy Policy
==============

Privacy
-------

Sciencing.com provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of Sciencing's website, located at the domain Sciencing.com (the "Sciencing Website"). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Sciencing Website.

Information Collection and Use
------------------------------

It is not necessary to provide Sciencing with your personally identifiable information to use the Sciencing Website, and Sciencing does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the Sciencing Website.  If you contact Sciencing by email through the Sciencing Website, Sciencing may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to Sciencing in your message, to respond to you.  Sciencing treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence, and has no obligation to keep this information confidential, nor to take any security measures to protect this information.

When you visit the Sciencing Website, Sciencing's servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. Sciencing uses Log Data to monitor use of the Sciencing Website and the services we offer via the Sciencing Website and for the Sciencing Website's technical administration.

Cookies and Other Analytic Tools
--------------------------------

Like many websites, Sciencing also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Sciencing Website and the services offered via the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that Sciencing's servers transfer to your computer's hard disk. Sciencing may also use tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are small graphic images, which are used in email messages to determine whether the messages were opened and the links were clicked, or are used on the Sciencing Website to collect information about the browser and device viewing the Sciencing Website. Sciencing does not use cookies or tracking pixels to collect personally identifiable information.

Sciencing mainly uses "session cookies", which enable certain features of the Sciencing Website and services offered via the Sciencing Website, to better understand how you interact with the Web Site and services we offer via the Sciencing Website, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Sciencing Website, and to improve the Sciencing Website and services offered via the Sciencing Website. Session cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Sciencing Website.

Sciencing also uses a persistent cookie that stays on your computer after you leave the Sciencing Website, for the sole purpose of ensuring that you receive a variety of Sciencing content (also called "frequency-capping").

Third Party Advertisers
-----------------------

The Sciencing Website includes advertising from third party advertisers. Sciencing does not provide any personally identifiable information to these advertisers.

Third party advertisers, or companies working on their behalf, may serve directly to your browser the advertisements that appear on the Sciencing Website, which allows them to receive Log Data (as defined above). They may also use cookies, JavaScript, tracking pixels and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Sciencing does not control any third party advertiser tracking or measurement technologies, and the information practices of third party advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

Opting Out
----------

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you choose not to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your email program and browser, but that may affect images in other emails you receive and the web pages you browse.

Sciencing also uses analytics technologies such as Google Analytics, Quantcast and comScore. For Google's privacy practices see www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html and to opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics on the Sciencing Website, see [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). For Quantcast's privacy practices see [https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/](https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/), and to opt out of receiving interest-based content and ads enabled by Quantcast, see https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/. For comScore's privacy practices see [http://www.comscore.com/About-comScore/Privacy-Policy](http://www.comscore.com/About-comScore/Privacy-Policy) and [http://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx](http://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx), and to opt out of having comScore associate site visits with your browser, see [http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx](http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx).

Sciencing may allow third-party companies, including ad networks, to serve advertisements, provide other advertising services and/or collect certain information when you visit our website.

To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of self-regulatory programs such as the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit the NAI's website <[http://optout.networkadvertising.org](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/)\>, which will allow you to opt out of Interest-Based Advertising by one, or all, NAI members.

Do Not Track
------------

Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. Sciencing currently does not take action in response to these signals. Also, please note that regardless of Sciencing's practices with respect to "do not track" signals, third party service providers Sciencing has engaged may use cookies to collect your personal information or online activities over time and across different web sites. For more information regarding Do Not Track mechanisms, see http://allaboutdnt.com/.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
----------------------------------

Sciencing cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties, to enforce and comply with the law. Sciencing may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as Sciencing, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Sciencing or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

If any or all of the assets of Sciencing are acquired by, or merged with another entity, Sciencing will share with this entity some or all of the information collected through the Sciencing Website.

Security
--------

Because Sciencing does not collect any personally identifiable information from the Sciencing Website, Sciencing does not take any specific security measures to protect the information we do collect.

Links to Other Sites
--------------------

The Sciencing Website may contain links to other web sites ("Linked Sites") operated by Sciencing or third parties. Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that Sciencing collects through the Sciencing Website. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Sciencing does not exercise control over third party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by Sciencing is subject to the terms and conditions provided by Sciencing for such Linked Site.  Sciencing encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Our Policy Towards Children
---------------------------

The Sciencing Website is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Sciencing with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact Sciencing at staff@Sciencing.com.  If Sciencing becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided Sciencing with personally identifiable information, Sciencing will remove such information from our files.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

Sciencing reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted here.  You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at staff@Sciencing.com.

Last Update: January 6, 2017

Mediavine Programmatic Advertising (Ver 1.1)
--------------------------------------------

The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a "device") by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.

First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, "Tags") may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser's cache. The "help" feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser's cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at [All About Cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.

The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:

* IP Address
* Operating System type
* Operating System version
* Device Type
* Language of the website
* Web browser type
* Email (in hashed form)

Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor's referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit [National Advertising Initiative opt out page](https://thenai.org/opt-out/). You may also visit [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://optout.aboutads.info/#/) and [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#) to learn more information about interest-based advertising. You may download the AppChoices app at [Digital Advertising Alliance's AppChoices app](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) to opt out in connection with mobile apps, or use the platform controls on your mobile device to opt out.

For specific information about Mediavine Partners, the data each collects and their data collection and privacy policies, please visit [Mediavine Partners](https://www.mediavine.com/ad-partners/).
