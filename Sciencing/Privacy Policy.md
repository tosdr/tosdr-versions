We disclose the personal information you provide or that we collect in some circumstances to the following third parties:

### 7.1. Advertisers, Advertising Networks and Data Analytics Companies.

We share your personal information with advertisers, third-party advertising networks and analytics companies who use it to deliver targeted advertisements to you on the Services or third-party websites or advertisers. Similarly, these advertisers share personal information with us about you that they have independently gathered or acquired. We also share the personal information we have collected in order to enable our advertising partners to perform data analysis or for advertising-related use. That personal information is always encrypted except cookie IDs.

### 7.2. Cooperative Database and Marketing Companies

These companies provide what is called a "cooperative database", which is a type of database that holds information about customers and their transaction histories through which many companies, such as ours, will contribute information to the database in return for aggregate information on the customers other companies have provided. None of the companies that participate in these cooperative databases reveal which company has collected that data, so none of the participating companies are able to identify which company the data is associated with. Each email and mailing address is then associated with specific business categories (e.g., home decor, artwork, etc.) based on customersâ transaction histories. The participating companies, like ours, are then able to process, using data mining and other marketing targeting techniques, the email and mailing addresses in relation to the specific business categories they want to target in their direct mailing. Such databases are generally used for promotional mailings, credit card fraud detection, digital media targeting, business intelligence or fighting e-mail spam. In our case, these databases are used for promotional mailings and direct mail campaigns: this means that, from time to time, we share our customersâ email and mailing addresses and related transactional information, such as your purchase history, amounts paid and products ordered, with cooperative database and marketing companies for promotional mailings and direct mail campaigns. These types of marketing campaigns are mainly carried out in relation with our Saatchiart.com and Society6.com websites. Some of the third-party vendors who receive your personal information from us may resell it for their own direct marketing purposes, and the direct marketing purposes of other third-party marketing companies.

If you prefer to opt-out of the use of your email and mailing addresses for the above purposes, please let us know at [\[emailÂ protected\]](https://sciencing.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### 7.3. Our Service Providers and Contractors.

We share your information with service providers and contractors who work on our behalf. For example, they may handle payment or credit card processing, data management, customer data pooling or aggregating, feature administration, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. They also include accountants, auditors, lawyers, insurers or similar advisers when we ask for their professional advice. Service providers and contractors will only have access to the personal information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf.

### 7.4. Social Media Sites.

Our Services may use social networking or "share functionality" or contain links to third-party social media sites or applications that are not owned or controlled by us. We also may allow you to use social media sites or applications to leverage your existing social media site or application accounts to access features of the Services. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of personal information about you by these sites or applications, depending on the feature.

### 7.5. Our Business Partners

If you are directed to the Services through a third party, we share certain information back with that third party, which may include personal information such as name, email and value of purchase depending on the type of relationship or Services utilized.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for any share functionality or the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party site or application. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites or applications with which you interact to make sure you understand the personal information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites.

### 7.7. Other Businesses.

We will disclose your personal information to other businesses in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets or any business, any user personal information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties in such transaction or event. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction or event, to transfer or assign your personal information and other personal information we have collected from users of the Services to third parties. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user personal information will be subject to this Privacy Notice. However, any personal information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy notice adopted by the successor entity or acquirer, as applicable.

### 7.8. Government Authorities, National Security or Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts and Other Similar Third Parties

We will disclose your personal information to these third parties:

* if required to do so, and to the extent permitted, by law;
* if requested in response to a subpoena or court order;
* if we believe in our sole and absolute discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud;
* to protect the property or other rights of us or other users, third parties or the public at large; or
* if we believe that you have abused the Services by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws, or in violation of our Terms of Use.

However, you will need to provide some personal information in order to receive certain discounts or benefits. In such circumstances, we offer a price difference that is reasonably related to the value of your data to us in connection with the discount or benefit.

The price differences reflected in our discounts and offerings are provided based upon our reasonable determination of the estimated value of the data you provide to us, which takes into consideration a number of factors, including, among other things, our estimates regarding the anticipated revenue generated from such data and the actual and anticipated expenses that we incur in the collection, storage, and use of such data in connection with our discounts and offerings. If you choose to withdraw from our discounts and offerings or choose not to create an account with us, you can still continue to use our website as a guest user.

14\. Security Measures and Storage Limits
-----------------------------------------

We provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal data we process and maintain. For example, we take reasonable measures to limit access to this data to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for data we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services and you do so at your own risk. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any personal data breaches and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Our retention periods for each category of personal information, including sensitive personal information, are based on our business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal information only for as long as is reasonably necessary for us to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and as otherwise to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. If we continue to retain your personal data in accordance with a legal obligation, any further processing of your data will be limited to compliance with such legal obligation.

Where required by Data Protection Laws, we shall delete your personal information when we are requested to do so. Even if we delete your personal information from our active databases, some or all of the personal information you provided may be required in order for the Services to function properly and it may remain in backup storage or records retention archival media (not to be used for any other purpose) until it is permanently deleted in accordance with our standard retention schedules.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal obligations.

If you do not agree to such changes following such notice, you should discontinue your use of the Services prior to the time the modified Privacy Notice takes effect.
