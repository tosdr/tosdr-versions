For example, we might note the percentage of immigrants in a State that are from a particular geographic region or country. Such disclosure will never include Personal Information, and we will not re-identify it. |

**9.  What Are Our Retention Practices?**

The Services are fundamentally premised on the notion that the personal voyage of self-discovery is not a one-time event and continues over lengthy periods of time—possibly lifetimes. Additionally, and with particular regard to our subscribers and DNA customers who pay fees or purchase subscriptions, the ongoing enhancement of our collections of historical records and DNA features provide benefits and insights to our users over time. As a result, our retention practices reflect this ongoing value by retaining user accounts on our system until our users inform us of their desire to delete their data or close their accounts.

| Information Category | Retention Period |
| --- | --- |
| **Account and Profile** | Ancestry will retain the Personal Information you provide while creating your account and your profile until such time as you delete your account. |
| **Family Tree** | Due to the multi-generational significance of family trees, Ancestry will retain your family tree data to provide you with continuous access, updated features, and the ability to enhance your family tree. Your family tree data is kept until you delete your family tree or your account. |
| **DNA** | Ancestry retains your DNA Data to provide you with the features and functionality you purchase (or are gifted), including continuously updated features, increasingly granular ethnicity estimates and improved ancestral regions and ancestral journeys, as well as other new features based on your DNA Data. Your DNA Data is kept until you delete your DNA test results or your account.<br><br>If you were a customer of AncestryHealth, our AncestryHealth laboratory partners are required to retain your DNA Data and test result for a period of at least seven years, or as required by state law and the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (CLIA) and the guidelines that apply to laboratories certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). |
| **Related Brands** | Some of our related brands ([Fold3](https://www.fold3.com/), [Forces War Records](https://uk.forceswarrecords.com/), [Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com/)™, [Archives](https://www.archives.com/), [We Remember](https://weremember.com/), and [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/)) have their own account logins and will retain the Personal Information you provide while creating your account and your profile as needed to provide you with continuous and updated Services until such time as you ask us to delete it. |
| **Usage Information** | We retain usage information (e.g., visits to sites) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. Once aggregated, this information ceases to be Personal Information and will not be subject to user deletion requests. |

**10.  How Can I Delete My Personal Information?**

You can delete, or request that we delete, your Personal Information from Ancestry at any time.

| Information Category | How To Delete |
| --- | --- |
| **Personal Information** | You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry by [following these instructions](https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Deleting-Your-Ancestry-Account).<br><br>If you have shared information with other users (for example, by making your family trees public or by sharing your DNA results directly with other users), Ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other users may have retained, which can only be removed by your contacting the other user and asking them to delete it.<br><br>Please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records to the responsible archival entity.<br><br>We will consider requests for removal of Personal Information from the searchable indexes of the records we hold on a case-by-case basis in accordance with law.<br><br>For information on Personal Information processed by Ancestry relating to non-Ancestry users please click [here](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/nonuser). |
| **Genetic** | If you request that Ancestry delete your DNA Data, we will delete all Genetic Information from our production, development, analytics, and research systems within 30 days.<br><br>To request the destruction of your Biological Samples, you must contact [Member Services](https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport). If you have agreed to our [Informed Consent to Research](https://www.ancestry.com/dna/consent), we will not be able to remove your de-identified Genetic Information from active or completed research projects, but we will not use it for any new research projects. |
| **General** | There may be some latency in deleting your Personal Information from our backup systems after it has been deleted from our production, development, analytics, and research systems. Our laboratory partners may also retain information they receive from us to comply with laws or regulations requiring retention of certain data, such as the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ancestry also retains certain information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, as well as to comply with tax, payment industry, securities, and clinical regulatory compliance requirements. |
| **Related Brands** | To delete information from our related brands ([Fold3](https://www.fold3.com/), [Forces War Records](https://uk.forceswarrecords.com/), [Newspapers.com](https://www.newspapers.com/)™, [Archives](https://www.archives.com/), [We Remember](https://weremember.com/), and [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/)), you can contact us at the related brand and request that your Personal Information be deleted from that service.

The Ancestry security team regularly reviews our security and privacy practices and enhances them as necessary to help ensure the integrity of our systems and your Personal Information.

We use secure server software to encrypt Personal Information (including Genetic Information), and we only partner with security companies that meet and commit to our security standards.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Ancestry commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Information received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF should first contact Ancestry at: [\[email protected\]](https://www.ancestry.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to disclose information with our service providers and third-party partners for a variety of reasons, including to measure, target, and serve advertisements as further described in this Privacy Statement.

Under the laws in some U.S. jurisdictions, you have the right to opt out of our sharing of your Personal Information for online targeted advertising. Ancestry does not sell or share your Personal Information for other purposes. You can learn more about our practices and the controls we provide you or opt out of certain types of such sharing by visiting our [Cookie Policy](https://www.ancestry.com/c/legal/AboutCookies).

For logged-out users, these choices are browser and device-specific. If you use multiple devices such as your smartphone, laptop, or tablet when you engage with the Services, you will need to specify your choices for each device. If you clear cookies from the cache in your browser, your “Do Not Sell or Share” preference will be erased, and you’ll need to specify your choice again.

Some browsers or plug-ins use a Global Privacy Control (GPC), which you can learn more about at https://globalprivacycontrol.org. If our site detects a GPC signal from your device, we will interpret it as a request to opt out of selling or sharing your Personal Information and to opt out of targeted advertising. If you opt out of targeted advertising via the GPC or the opt-out preference on the Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information/Opt Out of Targeted Advertising page, we may still deliver advertising to you that is not tailored based on your Personal Information.
