Your subscription to the Services (as defined in the Ancestry [Terms and Conditions](https://www.ancestry.com/c/legal/termsandconditions)) and purchase of AncestryDNA® is subject to these Renewal and Cancellation Terms. Capitalized terms used in these Renewal and Cancellation Terms if not defined here are as defined in the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.ancestry.com/c/legal/termsandconditions).  

**Subscriptions**

There are various payment and subscription options available for using the Services. These options can be found in the individual Services and may change from time to time. Once you register for a free trial or your initial payment is processed, your subscription has begun, and you can immediately access the relevant Service.

**1\. Automatic Renewals of Subscriptions**. Unless otherwise noted in the terms of your offer, subscriptions automatically renew, except for gift and pay-per-view subscriptions. This means that once you sign up for a free trial or become a subscribing member, your subscription will automatically renew based on the subscription program you chose (e.g. semiannually, monthly, etc.). Unless you are notified otherwise, you will be charged the rate stated at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes, such as value added tax when the stated rate doesn’t include VAT) at the beginning of the billing term of your subscription via the billing method you have provided to us. Please ensure that your billing information is correct to prevent an interruption in your subscription.

Prices and terms for subscriptions may change at any time. The price and terms in place when you made your initial purchase or when your subscription last renewed will stay in effect for the duration of that subscription period, but new prices and terms may apply to renewals or new subscriptions. Ancestry will give you reasonable notice of any change in price or terms before they go into effect. If you do not want to renew your subscription under these new prices or terms, you should cancel your subscription as described below.

**2\. Subscription Cancellations and Refunds**. You may cancel your Ancestry subscription by logging into your [Account Settings](https://www.ancestry.com/account) page or by [contacting us](https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport). Learn more about how to cancel your Ancestry subscription [here](https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Canceling-a-Subscription). If you access Fold3®, Newspapers.com™, or Forces War Records through an Ancestry All Access subscription, you may cancel your subscription by logging into your [Account Settings](https://www.ancestry.com/account) page or by [contacting us](https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport). If you subscribe to Ancestry Pro Tools, Fold3, Forces War Records, or Newspapers.com™ separately, including a Newspapers.com™ Publisher Extra® add-on, see below for cancellation details. All refunds will be credited to the billing method associated with your account. For information on how to cancel a subscription purchased through the Ancestry app, go [here](https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Canceling-a-Subscription-from-the-Ancestry-App).

If you are using the Services in the EU or UK, you may also cancel your Ancestry subscription by filling out this [contact form](https://support.ancestry.com/s/email-us), your Newspapers.com™ subscription by filling out this [contact form](https://www.newspapers.com/contact), or your Forces War Records subscription by filling out this [contact form](https://uk.forceswarrecords.com/contact?subject=Support).

You may cancel your Fold3® subscription by logging into your [Account Details](https://www.fold3.com/account) page on Fold3.com or by contacting us [here](https://www.fold3.com/contact).

Unless otherwise stated in the terms of your subscription, the following terms will apply:

Free Trials: Some of the Services allow you to register for a free trial so you can try the Services before starting a paid subscription. If you register for a free trial, you may cancel at any time prior to two days before the end of the free trial period and incur no charge. If you do not cancel by that time, your paid subscription will start once your free trial period ends. One free trial per user. After a free trial ends and you are charged for your subscription, no refunds will be issued, except as outlined below. This does not affect your statutory rights. For users located in the European Union, your free trial is inclusive of your cooling off rights and your right to withdraw from the contract.

Monthly Subscriptions (including Preserve My Tree and Ancestry Pro Tools, where available): Monthly subscriptions may be cancelled at any time prior to two business days before your renewal date but are not eligible for a refund, except as outlined below. If you cancel your monthly subscription, you will retain access to your Services for the remainder of the subscription period that you have paid for. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription every month until you cancel. Ancestry Pro Tools requires an active Ancestry family history subscription. If your Ancestry family history subscription expires, your Pro Tools subscription will automatically be cancelled at the end of the current paid month.

Subscriptions Longer than a Month, Billed Upfront:

* **For Ancestry subscriptions (including AncestryDNA Plus):** Except as outlined below, if you cancel this type of subscription before the end of your subscription period, you are not eligible for a refund (this does not affect your statutory rights), but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of your subscription period, after which your subscription will be cancelled. If your subscription did not begin with a free trial, during the first 14 days of your first subscription term you may either (1) cancel immediately for a full refund and immediate loss of access, or (2) cancel effective at the end of your current subscription, with no refund. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription (unless you are notified otherwise), until you cancel. After your subscription renews, you are not eligible for any refunds. Refunds are not based on account usage.
* **For Fold3, Newspapers.com, Forces War Records, and Archives subscriptions:** Subscriptions longer than one month that are billed upfront may be cancelled during the first 30 days for a full refund. If this subscription begins with a free trial, the 30 day period begins after the free trial ends. If you cancel this type of subscription after the first 30 days, you will not receive a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of your subscription period, after which your subscription will be cancelled. This does not affect your statutory rights. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription (unless you are notified otherwise), until you cancel. Refunds are not based on account usage.

Subscriptions Longer than a Month, Billed Monthly: Where offered, some subscriptions longer than a month may be eligible for monthly billing. Even though you will be billed monthly, you are committing to the entire length of your subscription (e.g. 6 months or 12 months). Except as outlined below, if you cancel this type of subscription before the end of your subscription term, you are not eligible for a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of any paid months (after which your subscription will be cancelled), and you may be charged a cancellation fee. This does not affect your statutory rights. If your subscription did not begin with a free trial, during the first 14 days of your first subscription term you may either (1) cancel immediately for a full refund of the first month’s fee and immediate loss of access, or (2) cancel effective at the end of the first month, subject to a cancellation fee. If you change from this type of subscription to a different type of subscription before the end of your subscription term, you will receive a prorated refund for the remainder of the current paid month, and you may be charged a cancellation fee. For subscriptions purchased on [www.ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com/), cancellation fees are the lesser of (i) $25 USD for 6-month subscriptions or $50 USD for 12-month subscriptions (plus any applicable taxes) or (ii) the remaining cost of your subscription. For subscriptions purchased on [www.ancestry.co.uk](https://www.ancestry.co.uk/), cancellation fees are the lesser of 20 GBP/Euro or the remaining cost of your subscription. For subscriptions purchased on [www.ancestry.com.au](https://www.ancestry.com.au/), cancellation fees are the lesser of 25 AUD/NZD or the remaining cost of your subscription. For subscriptions purchased on [www.ancestry.ca](https://www.ancestry.ca/), and to the extent permitted under applicable law, cancellation fees are the lesser of 25 CAD or the remaining cost of your subscription. For subscriptions purchased on [www.ancestry.de](https://www.ancestry.de/), cancellation fees are the lesser of 20 Euro or the remaining cost of your subscription. If you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription, until you cancel. After your subscription renews, you are not eligible for any refunds.

Gift Memberships: Gift memberships may be cancelled by the purchaser for a full refund before the earlier of (a) 30 days after the date the gift is purchased and (b) the gift start date selected by the purchaser. No refunds are available after the gift start date. See the [Special Terms and Conditions for Gift Memberships](https://www.ancestry.com/c/legal/gift-terms) for more information.

Family Plan Subscriptions: Where available, a family plan allows the purchaser to grant additional users access to the relevant Services. The purchaser can add or remove users from the family plan at any time, and users can leave the family plan at any time by visiting your [Account Settings](https://www.ancestry.com/account) page. Any changes made to the family plan by the purchaser will apply to the subsidiary accounts. If the purchaser cancels the family plan, all users on the family plan will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of the subscription period, after which the subscription will be cancelled.

Pausing Your Subscription: Where available, for Ancestry subscriptions that automatically renew, you can choose to pause your subscription by delaying your renewal payment for up to 2 months at the end of your current billing cycle. You can only pause your subscription once per billing cycle, and once the pause begins, you will not be able to change the duration of the pause. You will lose access to any paid content for the duration of your pause. Your subscription will be reactivated automatically after the specified pause duration at the price at which it would have renewed prior to the pause, and you authorize your form of payment to be charged for your subscription on a recurring basis upon reactivation. If you choose to cancel your subscription while it is paused, you will not be charged.

Credits: Some Services may be purchased as credits, in varying quantities, to be used over a period of time. Credits purchased are valid for the period specified at the time of purchase. Any credits unused within the period of permitted use will expire following the expiration date, except where prohibited by law.

Taxes and Fees: You will be responsible for all taxes and fees charged by other companies such as shipping, mobile carrier fees, data plan charges, overdraft fees, credit card fees, and foreign transaction fees.

Remedy: If you are a European Union or United Kingdom consumer you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident and you may have a right of remedy under your local laws, if the Service, or any part of it, does not conform with how it has been described.

**AncestryDNA® Kits**

**1\. Cancelling Laboratory Processing of your AncestryDNA Kit**.

You may cancel the laboratory processing of your AncestryDNA kit by [contacting Member Services](https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport). If you have already submitted your sample, you will need to provide your sample tube code to Member Services in order for us to identify and destroy your sample. The tube code is included in your AncestryDNA test kit. We recommend you store the code in a safe place.

If the laboratory has already processed your sample, you may request the destruction of your sample by contacting Member Services. You may also delete your test results by following the instructions in your [DNA test settings](https://www.ancestry.com/dna/settings).

**2\. Refund Eligibility**.

United States

* **AncestryDNA** kit purchases are eligible for a refund if you request a refund and return the kit within 60 days of placing your kit order, minus a $15 processing fee. You must return the kit to receive a refund. Ancestry does not refund shipping and processing charges or any applicable taxes paid on the non-refundable portion for kits purchased in the United States. All refunds will be credited to the billing method associated with your account. If you purchased your AncestryDNA kit through Amazon, Walmart (online or in-store), Legacy.com, or Target.com, you should contact those sellers directly to request a refund.
* **Traits**: If you purchased traits for your existing DNA test after your DNA results have been made available in the Services, you will have access to your traits as soon as your payment is processed, and you are not eligible for a refund of your traits purchase. If you purchase traits for your existing DNA test that you have activated, but your DNA results have not been made available in the Services, you may cancel your traits purchase by contacting [Member Services](https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport/dna?language=en_US) and are eligible for a refund until your DNA results are made available. Once your DNA results are available, you are not eligible for a refund of your traits purchase. Your purchase of an AncestryDNA kit that includes traits is governed by the above cancellation and refund terms applicable to AncestryDNA kits that do not include traits. If you are in the European Union, you have the right to withdraw and change your mind and cancel your order for traits and receive a full refund, including shipping costs, at any time within 14 days of receiving your order.
* **Add-On Options**: Where available, if you purchased the gift wrap add-on, you may cancel your gift wrap purchase by contacting Member Services and are eligible for a refund of your gift wrap purchase until your AncestryDNA kit has shipped. Where available, if you purchased the priority processing add-on, you may cancel your priority processing purchase by contacting Member Services and are eligible for a refund of your priority processing purchase until we have received your sample. Your purchase of an AncestryDNA kit that includes a gift wrap and/or priority processing add-on is otherwise governed by the above cancellation and refund terms applicable to AncestryDNA kits that do not include gift wrap and/or priority processing add-ons.
* **DNA Uploads**: If you pay a fee to upload your DNA Data from another DNA testing provider, you are not eligible for a refund of your purchase after your DNA results are made available in the Services.

**Refund Process.**

To request a refund of your AncestryDNA kit, you must (1) provide the same information you provided to us when you placed your kit order, and (2) return your AncestryDNA kit to us. Please contact Member Services for more information.

Outside the United States: You have the right to withdraw and change your mind and cancel your order for an AncestryDNA kit and receive a full refund, including shipping costs, at any time within 14 days of receiving your order. Note that you will not be entitled to a full refund of shipping costs if you expressly choose a delivery option which costs more than the least expensive type of delivery. In this case, you will only be entitled to a refund of shipping costs up to the least expensive type of delivery that Ancestry offers. You may [call us](https://support.ancestry.com/s/phonesupport) to cancel your order and request a refund. You will need to know your order number when you call to cancel. Your order number is in the order confirmation email you received after placing your order. Your right to cancel will lapse 14 days following the date you receive your order. If you cancel your DNA test after you have submitted your sample, you will not be able to access any DNA results. Your refund will only be provided via the credit card you used to purchase the AncestryDNA kit. Please allow a reasonable time for the credit to reach you.

**3\. Replacement Testing Kits**.

Should you require a replacement AncestryDNA testing kit in the US, you may call AncestryDNA at 1-800-958-9124 and provide the same information that you provided when you ordered your AncestryDNA kit. Depending on the reason for a replacement kit, we may charge a fee of $25 per kit (plus applicable shipping and handling) in the US. Should you require a replacement AncestryDNA testing kit outside the US, you may contact AncestryDNA by [phone or email](https://support.ancestry.com/s/phonesupport). There is no additional charge for replacement kits outside of the US.

**4\. Bundles**.

From time to time, where offered, Ancestry may offer multiple products (such as an AncestryDNA kit and a family history subscription) in combined packages, or “Bundles”. You may return a Bundle for a refund within 60 days from the date of purchase. Bundles may only be returned as a complete package. We do not accept returns of any product(s) that were sold as part of a Bundle, unless the Bundle is returned complete. If your Bundle includes an AncestryDNA kit, you must return the kit in order to be eligible for a refund, and a $15 processing fee (per AncestryDNA kit) will be deducted from your refund amount. For users in the European Union, no processing fees will be deducted from the refund amount.
