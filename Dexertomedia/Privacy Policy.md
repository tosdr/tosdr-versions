You can control what cookies you consent to us using, in accordance with our cookies policy.

### Information We Collect

### How We Work with Third Parties

Dexerto may, in some instances, disclose personal information to third-parties when it is appropriate, in order to deliver a service or product, or to help us improve your experience with us, or when required by law.
