Terms of Service
================

Acceptance of Terms of Service
------------------------------

Please carefully review these Terms of Service (“**Terms**)” before you use the Services as these Terms are legally binding on you.

These Terms constitute an agreement (together with any of our policies, including the Kumospace Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference, the “**Agreement**”) between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“**user**,” “**you**” or “**your**”) and Kumospace, Inc. (“**Kumospace**,” “**Company**,” “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”), concerning your access to and use of the website located at [www.kumospace.com](https://www.kumospace.com/) (the “**Website**”) and/or the Kumospace internet-based virtual video chat platform (the “**Kumospace Platform**”) (together, the “**Services**”).

The Services may include your access to or use of the Kumospace Platform which enables event hosts (each, a “**Kumospace Host**”) (which may be you) to host access to virtual events or Floors (“**Kumospace Floors**”).

By accessing or using any of the Services, you (on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent) are accepting these Terms as well as Kumospace’s Privacy Policy. You must be at least 13 years old to access or use any of the Services. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 years old, you and your parent or guardian must review this Agreement together. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using the Services. Kumospace recommend that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on devices they provide their child. If you are 18 years old or older, you represent and warrant that you have all right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent).

If you do not agree with all of these Terms and Kumospace’s Privacy Policy, you are prohibited from accessing or using any of the Services.

Registration and Accounts
-------------------------

To use the Services, you must register for an account and provide certain information. Each registration is for a single user only. By creating an account, you agree to:

1. provide accurate, complete and current account information,
2. promptly update, as necessary, your account information,
3. safeguard the security of your account credentials,
4. take responsibility for the acts or omissions of any third party who has authority to access or use the account on your behalf, and
5. notify us immediately if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your account and/or the Services.

You may delete your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Services, and Company may suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these Terms.

Access to the Services
----------------------

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Company grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to access and use the Services solely in accordance with these Terms. We do not guarantee that the Services will be available at all times, in all locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer any particular feature or functionality for any particular length of time. We do not guarantee that the Services can be accessed on all devices, by means of a specific Internet or connection provider, or in all geographic locations.

In addition to any other restrictions in these Terms, the rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following restrictions:

1. unless you receive Kumospace’s express prior written approval for any exception(s), you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services, in whole or in part, or any content displayed on the Services;
2. you shall not modify, make derivative works of (except as expressly set forth herein), disassemble, reverse compile, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code or underlying structure, ideas, know-how or algorithms related to any part of the Services;
3. you shall not access the Services for any competitive purpose, including in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service; and
4. unless you receive Kumospace’s express prior written approval for any exception(s) and/or except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Services may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means.

Unless otherwise indicated, your use of any future release, update, or other addition to the functionality of the Services shall also be subject to these Terms. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in a writing signed by you and Company, you acknowledge and agree that Company has no and will have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the Services.

Company reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) with or without notice to you. You agree that Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.

Ownership of the Services
-------------------------

The Services and its entire contents, features, and functionality (including all information, software, text, data, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof) are owned by Company, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. Neither these Terms (nor your access to the Services) transfers to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such intellectual property rights, except for the limited access rights expressly set forth in Access to the Services above. In addition, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any configuration, selection, customization, arrangement or design by you of any Kumospace Floor using graphics, images, objects, video, or other software or technology provided by Kumospace in connection with your use of the Services (a “**Floor Design**”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of Company, and Company shall own all right, title and interest in and to such Floor Designs. You hereby make all assignments necessary and shall assist the Company to accomplish the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, Company has no obligation to notify, compensate, recognize or credit you in any way for any Floor Design. To the extent any Floor Design by you incorporates any User Content (defined below), the User Content License described below shall govern. Company and its licensors and suppliers reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms, and no implied licenses are granted under these Terms.

### User Content

“**User Content**” means any and all information and content that a user submits, provides, uploads, displays, posts, or otherwise transmits to or through the Services including text, chat posts, profiles, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, pictures, code, video, images, audio, files, materials, data, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names and other similar identifying mark, or other content. You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that personally identifies you or any third party.

### Legal Requirements; Privacy Statement

Company may disclose IP addresses, personal information, and any contents of the Services if Company believes that doing so is required or appropriate to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, warrant, administrative order, civil investigative demand, governmental or law enforcement investigation, court order, subpoena or other valid process. Please read the Kumospace Privacy Policy at [https://www.kumospace.com/privacy](https://www.kumospace.com/privacy) to understand more about our collection, use, storage and disclosure of your personal information.

### Representations and Warranties

Because you alone are responsible for your User Content, you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User Content violates any of the provisions of Prohibited Uses below.

Company has no obligation to preserve or provide backup services for any User Content, and your User Content may be deleted at any time without prior notice. You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of your User Content if you desire. You agree that Company will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any interactions in connection with User Content. If there is a dispute between you and any other user of the Services (including with any Kumospace Host), we are under no obligation to become involved.

### User Content License and Grant of Rights

You hereby grant to Company, its affiliates, licensors and licensees a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable license, to use, host, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, store, archive, prepare or create derivative works of, and otherwise use, transmit, communicate and disclose your User Content (or any portion of it), in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or later devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party (together, the “**User Content License**”). For clarity, the foregoing User Content License includes any logos, trademarks, service mark, trade names and other similar identifying mark or material that you provide through the Services.

You also hereby grant to all other users who can access your User Content on the Services the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your User Content on or through the Services without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.  
The User Content License and other rights granted by you in this Section (User Content License and Grant of Rights) will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

### Prohibited Uses

1. that violates or infringes any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right;
2. that is unlawful, harassing, bullying, embarrassing, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, invasive of another’s privacy, vulgar, defamatory, false, intentionally misleading, defamatory, libelous, pornographic, obscene, patently offensive, discriminatory, promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual or is otherwise objectionable;

10. engage in any activity that disturbs the peaceful, fair and respectful environment of the Services;

Company reserves the right not to link, or to remove the link, to any website or third-party application at any time without notice.

All matters relating to the Services and these Terms, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.

Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of New York, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) shall not apply to this Agreement or to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

------------------------

The Services may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

Electronic Communications

Subject to the Updates section below, for contractual purposes, you: (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form, including the posting of notices on the Company’s Website or within the Services or communicating via email, SMS, and push notifications; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in hardcopy. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.

Notice
------

All notices, demands, or consents given by you under these Terms will be in writing and will be deemed given when delivered to Company via confirmed email at [terms@kumospace.com](mailto:terms@kumospace.com). Subject to the Updates section below, any notices to you may be made via either e-mail or postal mail to the address in Company’s records or via posting on the Company’s Website or Services. Please report any actual or suspected violations of these Terms to Company at [terms@kumospace.com](mailto:terms@kumospace.com)

Entire Agreement
----------------

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Kumospace regarding your use of the Services and supersedes any and all prior understandings and agreements between us respecting such subject matter, except that if you or your company have executed a separate written agreement with us governing your use of the Services, then such agreement shall control to the extent that any provision of these Terms conflicts with the terms of such agreement.

Miscellaneous
-------------

If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation.” Neither party to these Terms is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms, and in such case, these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.

All sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including Ownership of the Services, User Content, Legal Requirements; Privacy Statement, You Alone Are Responsible for User Content, User Content License and Grant of Rights, Feedback, Indemnification, Term and Termination, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law and Jurisdiction, Time Limit to File Claims, U.S. Export Control Laws, Electronic Communications, Notice, Entire Agreement, Misc. and Marks.

-----

All trademarks, logos and service marks (“**Marks**”) displayed on the Services are Kumospace’s property or the property of other third parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party who may own the Marks.
