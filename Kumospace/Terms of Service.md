Terms of Service
================

Acceptance of Terms of Service
------------------------------

Please carefully review these Terms of Service (“**Terms**)” before you use the Services as these Terms are legally binding on you.

These Terms constitute an agreement (together with any of our policies, including the Kumospace Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference, the “**Agreement**”) between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“**user**,” “**you**” or “**your**”) and Kumospace, Inc. (“**Kumospace**,” “**Company**,” “**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”), concerning your access to and use of the website located at [www.kumospace.com](https://www.kumospace.com/) (the “**Website**”) and/or the Kumospace internet-based virtual video chat platform (the “**Kumospace Platform**”) (together, the “**Services**”).

The Services may include your access to or use of the Kumospace Platform which enables event hosts (each, a “**Kumospace Host**”) (which may be you) to host access to virtual events or Floors (“**Kumospace Floors**”).

By accessing or using any of the Services, you (on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent) are accepting these Terms as well as Kumospace’s Privacy Policy. You must be at least 13 years old to access or use any of the Services. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18 years old, you and your parent or guardian must review this Agreement together. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using the Services. Kumospace recommend that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on devices they provide their child. If you are 18 years old or older, you represent and warrant that you have all right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent).

If you do not agree with all of these Terms and Kumospace’s Privacy Policy, you are prohibited from accessing or using any of the Services.

Registration and Accounts
-------------------------

To use the Services, you must register for an account and provide certain information. Each registration is for a single user only. By creating an account, you agree to:

1. provide accurate, complete and current account information,
2. promptly update, as necessary, your account information,
3. safeguard the security of your account credentials,
4. take responsibility for the acts or omissions of any third party who has authority to access or use the account on your behalf, and
5. notify us immediately if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your account and/or the Services.

You may delete your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Services, and Company may suspend or terminate your account in accordance with these Terms.

Access to the Services
----------------------

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Company grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to access and use the Services solely in accordance with these Terms. We do not guarantee that the Services will be available at all times, in all locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer any particular feature or functionality for any particular length of time. We do not guarantee that the Services can be accessed on all devices, by means of a specific Internet or connection provider, or in all geographic locations.

In addition to any other restrictions in these Terms, the rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following restrictions:

1. unless you receive Kumospace’s express prior written approval for any exception(s), you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services, in whole or in part, or any content displayed on the Services;

3. you shall not access the Services for any competitive purpose, including in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service; and
4. unless you receive Kumospace’s express prior written approval for any exception(s) and/or except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Services may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means.

Unless otherwise indicated, your use of any future release, update, or other addition to the functionality of the Services shall also be subject to these Terms. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in a writing signed by you and Company, you acknowledge and agree that Company has no and will have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the Services.

Company reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (in whole or in part) with or without notice to you. You agree that Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services or any part thereof.

Ownership of the Services
-------------------------

The Services and its entire contents, features, and functionality (including all information, software, text, data, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof) are owned by Company, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. Neither these Terms (nor your access to the Services) transfers to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such intellectual property rights, except for the limited access rights expressly set forth in Access to the Services above. In addition, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any configuration, selection, customization, arrangement or design by you of any Kumospace Floor using graphics, images, objects, video, or other software or technology provided by Kumospace in connection with your use of the Services (a “**Floor Design**”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of Company, and Company shall own all right, title and interest in and to such Floor Designs. You hereby make all assignments necessary and shall assist the Company to accomplish the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, Company has no obligation to notify, compensate, recognize or credit you in any way for any Floor Design. To the extent any Floor Design by you incorporates any User Content (defined below), the User Content License described below shall govern. Company and its licensors and suppliers reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms, and no implied licenses are granted under these Terms.

### User Content

“**User Content**” means any and all information and content that a user submits, provides, uploads, displays, posts, or otherwise transmits to or through the Services including text, chat posts, profiles, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, pictures, code, video, images, audio, files, materials, data, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names and other similar identifying mark, or other content. You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that personally identifies you or any third party.

### Legal Requirements; Privacy Statement

Company may disclose IP addresses, personal information, and any contents of the Services if Company believes that doing so is required or appropriate to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, warrant, administrative order, civil investigative demand, governmental or law enforcement investigation, court order, subpoena or other valid process. Please read the Kumospace Privacy Policy at [https://www.kumospace.com/privacy](https://www.kumospace.com/privacy) to understand more about our collection, use, storage and disclosure of your personal information.

### Representations and Warranties

You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of your User Content if you desire.

You hereby grant to Company, its affiliates, licensors and licensees a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable license, to use, host, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, store, archive, prepare or create derivative works of, and otherwise use, transmit, communicate and disclose your User Content (or any portion of it), in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or later devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party (together, the “**User Content License**”). For clarity, the foregoing User Content License includes any logos, trademarks, service mark, trade names and other similar identifying mark or material that you provide through the Services.

Linked Websites and Third-Party Applications
--------------------------------------------

We have not reviewed all of the websites linked to the Services, third-party applications or ads accessible through the Services and are not responsible for the content of any third-party websites, applications or ads available through the Services.

Company reserves the right not to link, or to remove the link, to any website or third-party application at any time without notice.

Recording
---------

Users of the Services may choose to record virtual events only if they comply with all recording laws.

Kumospace Subscriptions
-----------------------

All subscriptions are recurring on a monthly or annual basis and will automatically renew at the end of each paid subscription period.  
  
Kumospace paid services are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance at the start of each billing cycle (“Billing Cycle”) or upon the addition of seats to the subscription plan. Billing cycles are typically either monthly or annual, depending on the type of subscription plan the user selects when purchasing a Subscription.  
  
Subscriptions are billed on a per-seat basis. These seats are referred to by Kumospace as Members and come with certain premium user features. The billed rate is in accordance with the subscription plan selected or at the negotiated per-Member rate.

### Changes to Existing Subscription

Any addition of new Members to a subscription becomes effective immediately and will be billed in accordance with the Subscription monthly or annual commitment. The addition of a new Member mid-billing cycle will result in a pro-rata billing rate for their billing cycle.

The addition of new Members to a subscription becomes effective immediately and will be billed in accordance with the subscription's monthly or annual commitment at their per-Member rate. Adding a new Member mid-billing cycle will result in a pro-rata billing amount for that billing cycle.

The subtraction or removal of existing Members will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. No pro-rata discount or credit will be applied for the removal of existing Members. These Members are billed at the full billing cycle rate. These Members are billed at the full billing cycle rate and their access to those premium features will remain unchanged until the end of the billing cycle.

Refunds
-------

Kumospace is not responsible for errors related to the subscription’s size, number of Members, or failure to cancel a subscription plan prior to the start of the next billing cycle. Kumospace has no obligation to issue refunds, especially for the following reasons:

* You have not had a chance to use the product within the free trial or subscription period.
* You are requesting a refund due to a financial or personal situation/goodwill.
* You do not have sufficient expertise to use the product.

That being said, our knowledgeable support team is here to assist you and ensure you are satisfied. We understand that human error can happen and are happy to evaluate refund requests on a case-by-case basis.

Subscription Plans Questions

You further agree that Company shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in an enforceable written agreement between you and Company. This indemnification obligation shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

Term and Termination
--------------------

Subject to this Section (Term and Termination), these Terms will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Services (including your account) at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use (or suspected use) of the Services in violation of these Terms.

Upon termination of your rights under these Terms, your account and right to access and use the Services will terminate immediately. You acknowledge and agree that any termination of your account may, in our sole discretion, involve deletion of your User Content associated with your account from our live databases, and Company will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your rights under these Terms, including for termination of your account or deletion of your User Content. Any termination by Kumospace does not constitute a waiver of any of Kumospace’s rights under this Agreement or under applicable law.

THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction
------------------------------

All matters relating to the Services and these Terms, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.

Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of New York, although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) shall not apply to this Agreement or to any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

Time Limit to File Claims
-------------------------

ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

The Services may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

Electronic Communications

Subject to the Updates section below, for contractual purposes, you: (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form, including the posting of notices on the Company’s Website or within the Services or communicating via email, SMS, and push notifications; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in hardcopy. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.

Miscellaneous
-------------

If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation.” Neither party to these Terms is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms, and in such case, these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.

All sections of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including Ownership of the Services, User Content, Legal Requirements; Privacy Statement, You Alone Are Responsible for User Content, User Content License and Grant of Rights, Feedback, Indemnification, Term and Termination, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law and Jurisdiction, Time Limit to File Claims, U.S. Export Control Laws, Electronic Communications, Notice, Entire Agreement, Misc. and Marks.
