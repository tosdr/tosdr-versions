#### 6\. How individuals can access and correct their Personal Information held by us.

You have the right to seek access to any of your Personal Information held by us unless there is a valid reason under an applicable privacy law for us to withhold the information.

##### Valid reasons include where:

* we have reason to suspect that unlawful activity or misconduct of a serious nature has been engaged in and giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to the matter; or
* giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within us in connection with a commercially sensitive process; or
