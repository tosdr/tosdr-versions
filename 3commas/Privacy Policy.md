This privacy notice (“**Notice**”) explains how we process, including how we use, store and disclose your personal data when: (i) you visit or otherwise interact with our website at [https://3commas.io/](https://3commas.io/) (“**Website**”), our desktop application at [https://app.3commas.io](https://app.3commas.io/) and/or our mobile application(s) (available via Apple App Store or Google Play Store) (jointly “**App**”); (ii) you access or interact with our 3Commas application programming interface (“**3Commas** **API**”); (iii) you (or the legal entity you represent) wish to register or have registered a user account, including agreeing to our Terms of Use, and using the Software; (iv) you subscribe to our newsletter and/or receive other direct marketing; (v) communicate with us through our Website, App or other communication channels (e.g., by email or our official social media accounts); or (vi) take any other actions on our Website, App, or 3Commas API, which entails us receiving and processing your personal data. The data we process may differ based on your interactions with us, so if anything here only applies to one specific use case, we’ll point this out to you.

Please note that this Notice does not describe how we process 3Commas’ potential employees data, thus if you are applying to a position at 3Commas please refer to our [Recruitment Privacy Notice](https://3commas-bf8aa341f252.breezy.hr/privacy-notice).

We do not knowingly allow children (under the age of 18) to sign up for a 3Commas account, and therefore, do not knowingly process children’s personal data. Should we discover that an individual below the age of 18 has registered for a 3Commas account, we will take appropriate measures to promptly remove their personal data from our database. If you believe an underage person has signed up for a user account or is in any way using the Software, please reach out to us at dpo\[at\]3commas.io.

**5\. RECIPIENTS OF PERSONAL DATA AND DATA TRANSFERS**
------------------------------------------------------

We may disclose your personal data to separate controllers, who process your personal data for their own purposes, and processors, who process your personal data on our behalf to help us to provide the Website, App and Software. These data recipients belong to the following categories:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Category** | **Purpose of disclosure** |

The personal data that we collect from you is primarily processed within the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), but we may transfer your data to and store it in countries outside of the EEA, which do not offer an equivalent level of protection. In such cases we use safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission) to ensure that a level of protection of personal data comparable to that applicable in the EEA is applied to your personal data. Upon your request to the contact details specified in Section 2 of the Notice, we can make available further information, including a copy of the safeguards applied.

**6\. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA**
--------------------------------------

We take reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure, abuse or other processing in violation of applicable law. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal data we process and the current state of technology. 

However, please be advised that no security measure can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data, including against unauthorised acts, access, hacking or data breaches by third parties. 

We also encourage you to take measures to ensure the safety of your personal data, including protecting your account. In particular, we strongly recommend you to enable two-factor authentication for your account and keep your password, API key and API secret confidential and stored in a secure location. In addition, we advise you to make sure of your device security and avoid using public unencrypted internet connection spots.

**7\. PERSONAL DATA RETENTION PERIODS**
---------------------------------------

We retain your personal data for the duration necessary to fulfil the objectives outlined in Section 4 of this Notice or for as long as we have a legal obligation to do so. In deciding the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the quantity, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the processing purposes and whether we can achieve these purposes through other means, and applicable statutory obligations. Whilst retaining your personal data, we take into account the viable need to resolve disputes and enforce the contract between us, or anonymise your personal data and retain this anonymised information indefinitely. The specific retention periods are the following:

| **Personal data category** | **Retention period** |
| --- | --- |
| Main Data and Billing Data relating to transactions | 7 years from the end of the financial year when the respective transaction took place, to comply with our obligations arising from applicable laws. |
| Other Main Data, Billing Data and Transaction Data relating to the taking and implementing the pre-contractual measures of the potential Terms of Use to be concluded between us or performing the Terms of Use concluded between us | 3.5 years from the termination of the Terms of Use, including deletion of User Account, under our legitimate interests to establish, exercise, or defend against potential legal claims. In case we have reasonable doubt that a party has breached the contractual relationship between us intentionally, we may prolong such retention period for a maximum of 10 years. |
| Communication Data | 3.5 years from the moment the respective communication-flow was closed, under our legitimate interests to establish, exercise, or defend against potential legal claims. In case we have reasonable doubt that a party has breached the contractual relationship between us intentionally, we may prolong such retention period for a maximum of 10 years. |
| Marketing Data | 30 days after the termination of the Terms of Use, including deletion of the User Account, or upon withdrawal of consent.  <br>In case the legal basis for processing your Personal Data is consent and you decide to withdraw the consent, we will stop processing the personal data for the previously communicated purpose, however, we will retain a note regarding your withdrawal of consent for the purposes of administering your decision and our data processing activities at least for a period of 3 years. |
| Technical Data and Usage Data | 30 days as of the collection of such data. |

Following the retention period or if we no longer need the personal data for the purposes specified in Section 4 of the Notice, we shall destroy the respective personal data within a reasonable time, unless the retention of personal data is required to perform duties or requirements arising from the applicable law or to protect against ongoing or threatened disputes, in which case we retain the personal data as long as the dispute is solved.

After the expiry of the retention period determined above or the termination of the legal basis for processing purpose, we may retain the materials containing the personal data in our backup systems, from which the respective materials will be deleted after the end of the backup cycle. We ensure that during the backup period appropriate safeguards are applied and the backed-up materials are put beyond use. Access to these backups is strictly limited to essential personnel on a need-to-know basis.

**8\. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING**
---------------------------------

We incorporate Artificial Intelligence technologies such as the Generative Pre-training Transformer technology (“GPT”) into our services, including but not limited to, our FAQ Chatbot. While we do not actively process your personal data within these services, any personal data you input may be subject to automated decision making. This activity will not result in any legal consequences for you. We prioritise the protection of your personal data and take all necessary precautions to ensure its security. Should you believe that your personal data has been processed in this regard, you may reach out to us for further actions regarding your data protection rights at dpo\[at\]3commas.io. For more detailed information about this use case, please also contact us at the aforementioned email address.
