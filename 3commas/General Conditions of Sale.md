To receive a refund, you must contact support with a corresponding request, and you shall receive the refund in the same amount you have paid for the Subscription.

**2.** **Refund for the annual Subscription.** In the case of an annual subscription, after the grace period of 14 days, the cost of each used month will be calculated at the price of the monthly subscription of your current plan.

For example, if you have been using the subscription for three (3) months and two (2) days, you will receive a refund for eight (8) months of the subscription (12 months - 4 months). Once 180 days have passed from the day of payment for the subscription, a refund will not be issued.
