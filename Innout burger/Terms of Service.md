If You believe that Your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide In-N-Out’s Copyright Agent a notice with the following information required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* Identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party;
* A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

  
Please send the notice and any other inquiries under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to:  
In-N-Out Burgers  
Attn: Copyright - Legal  
4199 Campus Drive, 9th Floor  
Irvine, CA 92612  
Fax: (949) 509-6378  
E-mail: copyright@innout.com  

In-N-Out will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate to respond to the notice. In doing so, In-N-Out may notify the user who submitted the infringing content. If You have been notified that Your content on the Services is infringing, You may submit a counter-notice to the Copyright Agent with sufficient information for In-N-Out to consider in taking any action.  
  
DO NOT make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in termination of Your access to the Services and/or other legal consequences, including costs and attorneys’ fees. If You are uncertain whether an activity constitutes infringement, You should seek the advice of an attorney.

**Privacy**  
In-N-Out appreciates Your use of the Services and respects Your privacy. You can review the [Privacy Policy](https://www.in-n-out.com/privacy-policy) for a list of the Services.

**Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**  
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. In-N-Out hopes to resolve any issues You have with the Services before needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against In-N-Out, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting Customer Service as shown below or by mailing the details of Your issue to the following: In-N-Out Burgers, Attn: Legal Department, 4199 Campus Drive, 9th Floor, Irvine, CA 92612. If In-N-Out is unable to informally resolve Your issue, You may proceed with a dispute against In-N-Out in accordance with the conditions herein.  
  
Except for certain types of disputes described below, You agree that disputes between You and In-N-Out (whether such disputes involves a third party) relating to these Services will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. ARBITRATION IS MANDATORY AND FINAL. You should be aware that discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that You would otherwise have in court may not be available in arbitration.  
  
Notices of arbitration should be sent to In-N-Out’s address provided above. There shall be one arbitrator agreed to by the parties within twenty days of receipt by the respondent of the request for arbitration or in default thereof appointed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The parties may alternatively elect an arbitrator from JAMS in the event that an AAA arbitrator is not available to the parties, whether by location, cost, or otherwise. The arbitration will be held in Orange County, California, U.S.A., or any other location upon which You and In-N-Out agree, and will be conducted in the English language. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. In-N-Out will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $20,000.  
  
Neither You nor In-N-Out will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims. You are giving up Your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim You may have against In-N-Out including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations. Neither You nor In-N-Out will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. You and In-N-Out each waive rights to trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms.  
  
In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to You or Your claim, You and In-N-Out agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions as described herein) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Orange County, California, U.S.A. Both You and In-N-Out consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.  
  
Exceptions to arbitration: As an alternative, You or In-N-Out may assert claims, if they qualify, in a local "small claims" court in Orange County, California or any United States county where You live and work. You may bring claims only on Your own behalf. You agree that In-N-Out may seek preliminary or injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Orange County, California to protect its rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.

**Modifications**  
In-N-Out may revise these Terms on occasion and will post the most current version with the Services. If a revision meaningfully reduces Your rights, we will notify You (by, for example, posting a notice with the Services or sending a notice to an e-mail address that You agree to provide). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, You agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

**Trademark Ownership**  
The following trademarks are used and owned by In-N-Out Burgers, and all rights are hereby reserved:

**Miscellaneous**  
These Terms constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to the Services. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., notwithstanding any conflicts of laws principles. In-N-Out’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect. You may not assign any of Your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. In-N-Out may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Nothing contained in this agreement shall create any association, partnership, or agency or joint venture between In-N-Out and You.

**Contact**

If you have any questions relating to the Terms or Services, please call Customer Service at 1-800-786-1000 or mail us at:
