VPN - What is not logged.

1\. IP addresses  
2\. DNS requests  
3\. Traffic  
4\. User bandwidth and data transfer  
5\. Any usage activity  
  
We do not log or monitor any user activity on our VPN. Everything you do whilst connected to our VPN is anonymous and not logged or viewed by us.

VPN - What is monitored.

1\. Server CPU usage  
2\. Server RAM usage  
3\. Region bandwidth  
4\. Current connections  
  
In order for our network to run efficiently and to give customers the best possible experience, we must monitor our hardware and bandwidth usage. We use this information to purchase more resources if we find the server resources exceed 80% of their capacity.  
  
We monitor the amount of connection(s) from your account to our network as we allow a maximum of six devices to be concurrently connected by each customer. We don't keep a historical log of connect / disconnect times AKA 'Connect / Disconnect Time Stamps'.

Website / Account - What is stored or monitored.

1\. Account status (paid or inactive)  
2\. Account settings  
3\. Payment processors  
4\. Account e-mail  
5\. Website login attempts  
6\. \*Support tickets  
7\. Matomo information  
  
In order for us to provide a service to our customers, we must be able to know if the customer has an active account or not. We store this information in order to provide service to our customers.  
  
We do store, in our database, your account settings and preferences. This is used for your account to function as intended. DNS settings, port forwarding settings, adblock settings, etc are stored in order for your account to function. None of these settings allow you to be identified.  
  
We use Stripe and Paypal to process our customers Paypal and credit card payments. We do not store payment details on our website. Our payment processors log everything they can about you. We do not have control over their logging. If you do not want your VPN purchase tied to you, please pay by Crypto or by sending money in the mail. We use Coinbase to process Crypto payments.  
  
Account e-mail is used to notify customers when their support ticket has been replied to. E-mail is also used for resetting customer passwords and notifying customers if our Terms of service and / or Privacy policy has changed.  
  
The amount of times you attempt to login to our website is temporarily stored for security reasons. This is to prevent brute force attacks. If an account login is incorrectly attempted multiple times, the account has a 15 minute login block placed on it.  
  
\*In order to provide support to our customers we keep our support tickets in our website's database. Once the ticket has been concluded (closed) the ticket is automatically deleted from our database after 48 hours.  
  
We use self-hosted software to monitor how visitors use our website in order to improve it. The software we use is Matomo. We do not share this data with third parties.
