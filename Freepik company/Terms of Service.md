Does not use the Freepik Content in printed or electronic items (e.g. t-shirts, cups, postcards, birthday or greeting cards, invitations, calendars, web models or electronic devices, apps, NFTs, videogames, advertising spots, audiovisual animations) aimed to be resold, in which the Freepik Content is the main element (because of size, relevance or any other cause, in case of doubt about whether the content is main element, it shall be deemed that the content is main element);
6. Does not use the Freepik Content (totally or partially) in any trademark, or part of the same, which may be used by any other means to guarantee or to imply a guaranty of any product and/or service, unless the Freepik Content used in such cases is modified in such a way as to be a new and different content not confusingly similar with the original Freepik Content or implies a use of the Freepik Content as a template or test, and not as a final item or material;

9. Does not make any use of the Freepik Content to slander, libel or to vilify a person, race, sex, culture, sexual orientation, religion, country, region, town, village or any other place, or any other human group.

When any Freepik Content is marked or identified as for editorial use, or when within the same there are logos, recognizable products, public buildings, public events or images taken in places where recognizable persons appear in the background, the User shall only be entitled to use it for such editorial use. In such cases, the User undertakes not to use that content in any manner that entails any connection with any business activity, the use in economic traffic or advertising, marketing or commercialization of any product or service. The User shall be directly liable and the Company shall not assume any liability as a result of the use for commercial purposes by the User of any content belonging to the Freepik Content, which according to this paragraph should be for editorial use only.

The User acknowledges that some laws may impose limits on the use of Freepik Content. For this reason, the User agrees that it is the User's responsibility, and not the Company's, to verify that the applicable regulations in the User's jurisdiction do not prohibit the User's use of the Freepik Content.

The authorization to use the Freepik Content shall be free provided that any use of the Freepik Content by the User is credited to the Company/Website as stated by the Company from time to time. In order to benefit from the Service or to use the Freepik Content without acknowledging the Company/Website, the User must purchase a premium subscription (hereinafter, the " **Premium Subscription**") in the Website and download the Freepik Content during the term of any such Premium Subscription. Conditions in Section 10 shall apply to the purchase of the Premium Subscription.

As a general rule, it is forbidden for a User to authorize any third parties to use the Freepik Content (or any modification of any Freepik Content). As an exception to the prohibition, the User may allow third parties to use the Freepik Content, when each and every of the following conditions are met:

1. The third party has professionally instructed the User to produce goods or provide services to it/him/her and the User uses a limited number of items within the Freepik Content to produce such goods or provide such services to the instructing third party;
2. The authorization granted by the User to the third party is in writing and complies with every restriction of the User’s authorization to use the relevant Freepik Content and includes, without limitation, a restriction for the third party to distribute, resell or license the relevant Freepik Content (i.e. the third party is the final user of the relevant Freepik Content);
3. None of the contents in the Freepik Content which are subject to the authorization are used as the main element (because of size, relevance or any other cause; in case of doubt about whether the content is the main element, it shall be deemed as the main element) in printed or electronic items (e.g. t-shirts, cups, postcards, birthday or greeting cards, invitations, calendars, web models or electronic devices, apps, NFTs, videogames, advertising spots, audiovisual animations) aimed to be resold by the third party;
4. The production of goods or provision of services by the User to the third party is not done by automatic means, it is tailor-made for the third party (and therefore its use is not authorized by the User to any other third party) and requires a specific substantial human intervention from the User in relation to each third party; and
5. The User -and not the third party- chooses the specific items within the Freepik Content to be used in the production of goods or provision of services for the third party.

When all of the above conditions are met, the User shall be entitled to authorize a third party to use the relevant Freepik Content. This exception refers only to the prohibition for the User to authorize third parties to use the Freepik Content without affecting or limiting in any way the remaining conditions of the User’s right to use the Freepik Content. Whether the above conditions regarding the exception to the prohibition for Users to authorize third parties to use the Freepik Content are met shall be interpreted restrictively so that, in case of doubt, it shall be deemed that the conditions are not met.

The User does not acquire any right as a result of the use of the Freepik Content. In particular, the User is not authorized to distribute, resell or rent any Freepik Content (or any modification of any Freepik Content).

The Company may, at any time, offer any content on the Website under a different license from the one included in this Section (the "Specific License"). The Company will inform on the Website which content is licensed under an Specific License. The Specific License will be made available to the User and will include, without limitation, a description of the license itself, as well as the permitted and prohibited uses in relation to the content. In the event that a particular content is offered under a Specific License, the Specific License shall apply over the general license described in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all other obligations contained in these Terms shall continue to be binding on the User, unless they conflict with the Specific License, in which case the Specific License shall prevail.

The User’s rights under this Section will end automatically without any notice if the User breaches any of the Terms. In case of termination of the rights hereunder, the User shall cease using the Freepik Content and will destroy every copy, whether total or partial, thereof.

#### 9\. Fonts License Agreement

2. include, embed, integrate, embed or otherwise distribute any Licensed Fonts in any document or web site or project in a manner that would allow external output of the Licensed Fonts or that would prevent or limit future visits to or downloads from the Website, or distribute or sublicense any portion of the Licensed Fonts independently or in any manner that would allow any third-party to access and/or use the Licensed Fonts to create new content;
3. add any functionality to, or otherwise change, alter, adapt, modify or produce (or cause others to produce), derivative works of any part of the Licensed Fonts;

When concluding the purchase procedure for any Teams Plan, it shall be deemed that the Administrator User has read and accepted, without exception, the Teams Plan Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Teams Plan Terms extend the Terms, which will continue to apply in full force to the Administrator Users who have acquired a Teams Plan, and to all Teams Plan End Users, unless otherwise stated in provisions of the Teams Plan Terms.

When concluding the purchase procedure for any Teams Plan on behalf of a legal entity, the Admin User represents and warrants that he/she has the necessary legal authority to bind such legal entity.

The Admin User grants on behalf of his legal entity to the Company a non-exclusive, irrevocable, free, worldwide license, for the duration of the Teams Plan, to display the Admin User's legal entity name, trademarks or logos in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports, customer listings on websites, research and market studies, and other activities related to the marketing and promotion of the Service.

These Teams Plan Terms are available to the Administrator User before purchasing the Teams Plan and may be stored or reproduced on a durable medium.

The Teams Plan Terms are available in English and Spanish. In case the Administrator User is interested in purchasing any Teams Plan, she/he has to follow the instructions available on the Website from time to time.

The plans and subscriptions available are offered on the Website where the relevant information, price, and conditions are included (including, without limitation, restrictions on the daily download allowance). The Company can modify the plan and subscriptions offered at any time, offering new Services or ceasing to offer any of the Services.

The price for the Teams Plan, depending on how many Teams End-Users Seats are requested by the Administrator User, is stated in the relevant currency on the Website and includes, if applicable, the appropriate Value Added Tax. The Company is entitled to modify the price for any Plan or subscription at any time. The Company shall apply the price stated on the Website at the time of submitting the Plan ordered by the Administrator User.

The Administrator User shall pay the Teams Plan in advance through Paypal, credit/debit card, Direct Debit, or any other valid payment method offered by the Company, as stated on the Website. The processing of the payment information and data through Paypal, credit/debit card, or Direct Debit is made through third-party sites. When ordering any Teams Plan, the Administrator User authorizes the Company to collect the corresponding price through the chosen payment method. The Teams Plan shall not be activated until the Company has received the payment or the payment has been authorized by the relevant financing entity. After that, the Teams Plan shall be in force for the term purchased by the User.

Unless otherwise stated in these Teams Plan Terms, the Teams Plan shall be automatically and successively renewed at the end of its term unless the Administrator User cancels the renewal of the Teams Plan before its expiration. The Company shall charge the corresponding price by the same initial payment method. The Company may modify the price for the renewal of the Teams Plan, provided that the Administrator User is informed with, at least, one-month prior notice, via email sent to the email address used for the registration process.

In addition, within the shortest time reasonably possible and not after twenty-four (24) hours after the acceptance of the order, an email shall be sent to the Administrator User with the receipt of the purchase. The receipt may be stored and printed. The Administrator User may request and download an invoice as stated within the Website twenty-four (24) hours after making the relevant payment.

Once the Administrator User purchases the Teams Plan, the system shall confirm the purchase, and the Teams Administrator Account will be created. Once the Teams Administrator Account is created, the Administrator User may activate different Teams End-Users accounts, limited to the number of Seats contracted (for the avoidance of doubt, the Administrator User’s account shall be counted as one among the contracted Seats, notwithstanding that the Administrator User may leave his/her Seat vacant to be used by another Teams End User for accessing and using the Services exclusively. In no case Teams End-User will assume any of the Administrator User’s obligations regarding this clause). To access their Seats, each End User must either log in to the Website using the email address indicated by the Administrator User, or create a User account on the Website using said email address.

End Users who have an active Premium Subscription associated with the email address indicated by the Administrator User will not be able to access their Seat. In this case, they will have to log in using another User account, or register on the Website using another email address.

Any Teams End-User Account is personal and non-transferable, and it is expressly forbidden to share any Teams End-User Account with any other Teams End-User or third parties. Failing to comply with this obligation will entitle Freepik to terminate the Terms immediately.

The Administrator User will have the ability to access all Teams End-User Accounts, including the ability to assign, un-assign, access, monitor, use, modify or access any data available to Teams End-Users associated with their Teams End-User accounts.

The Administrator User is solely responsible for

1. the fair use of (i) the Teams Plan product, and (ii) the lawful exercise of the ability to control, access and monitor Teams End-Users accounts;
2. authorizing as End-Users of his or her Teams Plan exclusively those individuals with whom the Administrator User has a personal or professional relationship in which both the invitation to collaborate and the subsequent monitoring are reasonable and within the legitimate expectations of the invitees;
3. informing all Teams End Users in detail of the authorized use of the Teams End-Users accounts according to these Terms and the Service Specific Terms;
4. the fair access and use of the Services in compliance with these Terms (including Teams End-Users); and
5. all activities regarding its Teams Plan account regardless of whether the activities are undertaken by Administrator User or Teams End-Users.

After purchasing the Teams Plan, both the Administrator User and the Teams End-Users may benefit from the same benefits as the Premium User, as described in Clause 10.

Freepik may use the Customer name, trade names, trademarks or logos in presentations, marketing material, customer lists, financial reports, customer lists posted on websites, market research studies and other marketing activities, including incidental reproductions such as screenshots, videos or other content of its API Client(s). The Customer hereby grants Freepik, which accepts, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, free, worldwide and perpetual license to display its company or organization's name, trade names, trademarks or logos for the aforementioned purposes. The Customer shall not make any public statement regarding its use of the API Services which suggests Freepik's association, sponsorship or endorsement without Freepik's prior written authorization thereof.

The rest of the Terms, including the conditions established or referred to in Clauses 7, 8 and 9, will continue to apply, such as, without limitation, the prohibited uses of Freepik Content.

As the content in the Website is digital by nature, no cancellation right shall apply, which is expressly acknowledged and accepted by the Administrator User, without prejudice to the guarantees stated in the consumers’ regulations that may be applicable, unless the Company states otherwise, in which case, will be subject to the conditions set forth by the Company.

#### 12\. Changes and Closure of the Website

The Company may, at any moment, and without incurring in any responsibility towards the User, modify the content of the Website or the Services, limit or modify the conditions or cease to provide some or all the Services and features available or deactivate and delete all or some of the User accounts and their corresponding information. However, the Company will comply with its obligations regarding the keeping of records in relation to certain transactions for the relevant period as provided by applicable law or refund the Users of Subscriptions in force at that time with the proportional part of the price not accrued before the termination.

#### 13\. General and Contact Information

The use of the Website and the Services and the interpretation and application of these Terms shall be governed by Spanish Law. Except for those cases in which the applicable law impose a specific jurisdiction, any dispute in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by the Courts of Málaga (Spain), and the parties expressly waive any other applicable jurisdiction.
