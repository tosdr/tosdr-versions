This Privacy Policy addresses all the requirements set out in the GDPR. The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. Please review this Privacy Policy before you use the Website or any of the services or features offered on or through the Site. By using the Website and its services and features, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or its services and features.

(1) Information collected[¶](#1-information-collected "Permanent link")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) may collect certain personal information from you when you register to use the Website or its services and features. We may also collect additional personal information, including your physical address, in order to deliver products. We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information from users of our site, such as their Internet protocol address, the type of browser and operating system they use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and the web pages, content and advertisements you may have visited, viewed or clicked on. We collect this information in several ways, including the following:

##### Cookies[¶](#cookies "Permanent link")

Cookies are text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personal information, but if you choose to furnish us with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We may use “cookies” to maintain a record of your visits and to improve the content and services on our site.

##### Web server logs[¶](#web-server-logs "Permanent link")

Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at this site, and the websites visited just before and just after our site. Google Analytics may also use these details for Analytics purposes. Please visit Google Analytics Privacy Policy to understand more about how they store data.

##### IP addresses[¶](#ip-addresses "Permanent link")

Our system may also collect your IP address, which is a numerical address that is used to identify a computer connected to the Internet. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, to deliver web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site.

##### Social logins[¶](#social-logins "Permanent link")

Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) also offers Social Logins for ease of use of its services. The data collected from this interaction will always be secured and will never become publicly available at any time. The Social Logins are provided by Gaming platform called Steam (steamcommunity.com) and chat platform called Discord (discordapp.com).

##### Public posting[¶](#public-posting "Permanent link")

If you post in the comments of a blog post on the Website (or anywhere on social media), you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, (such as blog comments) Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) will collect that information from your interaction, and the information will become publicly available.

(2) Information from minors[¶](#2-information-from-minors "Permanent link")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

Alpha Blend Interactive UG (haftungsbeschränkt) does recognize that parents, guardians, or other adults may purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy.

(5) Information we share[¶](#5-information-we-share "Permanent link")

We use third parties to provide services to us, such as:

These companies process personal data on our behalf. We only provide these companies with the information needed to deliver the service. We enter into written contracts to ensure that use of this data is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

* Address fraud, security, or technical issues
* Protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services

(6) Managing your data[¶](#6-managing-your-data "Permanent link")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

##### Understanding your rights[¶](#understanding-your-rights "Permanent link")

It is important that you understand your legal rights around your personal data and how we may use it. If you would like to discuss or exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Controller at [\[email protected\]](https://documentation.abinteractive.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

##### Right to be informed[¶](#right-to-be-informed "Permanent link")

This Privacy Policy aims to inform you about how we process your personal data. You might also see specific messages when we collect personal data from you that explain why we ask for it.

##### Right of access[¶](#right-of-access "Permanent link")

You have the right to access a copy of your personal data and receive certain information about what the data is and how and why we are processing it. We will ask you to prove your identity before we can disclose any information.

##### Right to erasure[¶](#right-to-erasure "Permanent link")

You have the right to request that we delete your data. There are some circumstances where we may need to keep your details, for example, if we are legally obliged to do so. If this is the case, we will explain and discuss these circumstances with you.

##### Right to restrict processing[¶](#right-to-restrict-processing "Permanent link")

You can request that we restrict processing of your data, as an alternative to deleting it – this means that we will keep the data but stop processing for most purposes. You may want to exercise this right if you feel that the data is inaccurate, that our processing of it is unlawful, whilst we progress a request from you to object to processing, or if we have no further need of the data, but you require us to keep it in relation to the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.

##### Right to data portability[¶](#right-to-data-portability "Permanent link")

You have the right to request a copy of your data, in readable form, and have us transfer it to another organization. There are some circumstances where these rights may not apply, but where this is the case we will always explain this to you.

##### Right to object[¶](#right-to-object "Permanent link")

You have the right to object to the processing of your data.

##### Rights related to automated decision making[¶](#rights-related-to-automated-decision-making "Permanent link")

You have the right to avoid being subject to decisions based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which has a significant effect on you. We do not carry out any such processing.

(7) Data retention[¶](#7-data-retention "Permanent link")
