Cookies policy
--------------

What is a Cookie?
-----------------

Most websites that you visit will use cookies. Cookies are set in order to improve your overall user experience by enabling the website that you visit (in this case, _[https://starandgarter.org](https://starandgarter.org/), [https://family.starandgarter.org](https://family.starandgarter.org/) and [https://shop.starandgarter.org](https://shop.starandgarter.org/)_) to store data. Cookies will either remember you for the duration of your visit (via a session cookie) or for repeat visits (via a persistent cookie).

Why are cookies good?
---------------------

Cookies perform a variety of functions, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, or storing your preferences so that you don’t have to re-enter these on your next visit. If the website you visit doesn’t use cookies, then it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site.

Websites can also use cookies to enable effective targeting of advertising, based on you, the user and your browsing habits/ location. Cookies can be set by the website that you’re visiting (first party cookies) or they can be set by other websites who are running content on the page that you, the user are viewing (third party cookies).

Types of Cookies
----------------

* First Party Cookies
    
    These are set by the website that you are viewing and are only able to be viewed by that website.
    
* Third Party Cookies
    
    These are set by a different organisation to the owner of the website that you are visiting. An example of this type of cookie is when a third party analytics company will add a cookie to the site that you are visiting, so they can track data from users. Third party cookies can also be set by companies such as YouTube, who may embed content onto a web page and set their own cookies.
    
* Session Cookies
    
    These are stored temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted once the user has closed their web browser.
    
* Persistent Cookies
    
    These cookies are stored for a fixed period and are not deleted when the user has closed their web browser. Primarily, persistent cookies are used when a website needs to retain information about you, the user. For example, this type of cookie is used to store your preferences for the next visit, so that they don’t need to be re-entered on your next visit.
    

What Cookies do we use?
-----------------------

* Google Analytics
    
    Google Analytics is widely used to understand which pages you arrive at, how you navigate around websites, and which kind of device you are using. To do this, Google collects individuals’ anonymised data and stitches it all together to create a big picture. All this data ultimately helps us make improvements to your experience. Find out more about [**Google Analytics cookies**](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).
    
* Hotjar
    
    Hotjar shows us the step-by-step path individuals take through our website and lets us know at which points users exit a page. It helps us to learn what the user finds interesting and what we need to improve. Find out more about [**Hotjar cookies**](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/cookie-information).

----------------------------------

We sometimes connect our site to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. These sites also use cookies, but we have no control over these third-party cookies.
