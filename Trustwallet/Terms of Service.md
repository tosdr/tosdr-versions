Services
--------

Trust Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, for digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, virtual commodities and NFTs (“Digital Assets”), meaning you are solely in control of and responsible for your Digital Assets and private keys, and accordingly you can authorize transactions from your wallet address. You expressly acknowledge and agree that as Trust Wallet is a non-custodial wallet software, you are solely responsible for your activity and any risk of loss at all times. Trust Wallet allows you to:

1. generate wallet addresses and associated private keys that you may use to send and receive digital assets;
    
2. browse and access third party decentralized application(s) (“DApp(s)”) and third party decentralized exchanges (“DEX”) through the mobile application’s web browser;
    
3. swap/trade digital assets through DApp functionality made available by third party service provider(s);
    
4. stake certain digital assets in a third party ‘proof of stake’ network through staking services (“Staking Service”);
    
5. view digital asset price information made available by third party service provider(s); and
    
6. broadcast Digital Asset Transaction data to various blockchains supported by Trust Wallet without requiring you to download or install the associated blockchain-based software to your local device.
    

### Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities

An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The private key is associated with the wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Digital Assets to and from that wallet address. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase (“Secret Phrase”) associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase, and private key access information secure. It is very important that you backup your private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot generate a new password for your wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such wallet address will become inaccessible. Accordingly, we shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information secure.

### Use of DApps and DEX

If you access or use DApps or DEX, including, without limitation, DApp functionality embedded within the Services such as the Trade/Swap Digital Assets function, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Trust Wallet is not responsible for your access or use of DApps or DEX and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of DApps or DEX, including, without limitation, any transactions you dispute; (ii) the limits of amounts that you may exchange via DEX per day shall be subject to any requirements of the third-party developed Smart Contracts; (iii) blockchain operations are irrevocable meaning when you conduct any transactions via DApps or DEX, you shall be solely responsible for the consequences of any issues associated with such transactions, including, without limitation, your transfer to an incorrect address or problems associated with the node servers selected by you; (iv) when you use DApps or DEX, third-party developed Smart Contracts may charge you handling fees and/or service fees and any information displayed on Trust Wallet relating to such fees are for your reference only as Trust Wallet cannot and does not guarantee its accuracy, applicability, reliability, integrity or appropriateness, nor shall Trust Wallet be liable for any loss or damage that may be caused directly or indirectly by your use of these contents; and (v) Trust Wallet does not currently charge any service fees or handling fees for the use of DApps or DEX, however, Trust Wallet may, in its discretion, charge such fees at any time in the future. Any updated fees will apply to any transaction that occurs following the effective date of the updated fees.

### Use of Staking Service

If you access or use the Staking Service, a third party may stake certain Digital Assets on your behalf (“Staked Digital Assets”), acting as a transaction validator on the applicable blockchain network. If a block of transactions is successfully validated using such Staked Digital Assets, a reward is granted by that network (“Staking Reward”). You acknowledge and agree that Trust Wallet is not responsible for: (i) your use of the Staking Service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of the Staking Service; (ii) ensuring Staking will occur on a continuous basis; and (iii) ensuring any particular Digital Asset will be staked or will continue to be staked.

### Buy Digital Assets with Supported Credit or Debit Cards

If you use Trust Wallet to purchase Digital Assets with your credit or debit card, a third party will convert your chosen amount into the applicable Digital Asset and credit it to your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Trust Wallet is not responsible for your use of such third party service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of such service; (ii) you will be subject to any terms and conditions imposed by the relevant third party service provider; (iii) Trust Wallet has no ability to change, withdraw or cancel any conversion requests you place; (iv) Trust Wallet is not responsible for any exchange rates offered by the relevant third party service provider(s); and (v) Trust Wallet is not responsible for any fees charged by the relevant third party service provider(s) or your bank or credit card issuer(s).

### Digital Asset Transactions

In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in the Digital Asset’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Trust Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) we do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction; (ii) the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks; (iii) we do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and (iv) any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.

### Accuracy of Information Provided by User

You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Digital Asset.

Wallet Registration and Security
--------------------------------

You must either import or create a wallet in order to use Trust Wallet. When you create a wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your private key or any other breach of security of your wallet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your private key. When you create a wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong unique password that you do not use for any other purpose (i.e. different to your phone password or any other passwords you use for websites, online services, etc.) and leveraging biometric authentication if available; (b) do not store the private key and Secret Phrase in plain text online or in an unsecured physical location; (c) limiting access to your devices and your wallet; (d) taking all necessary precautions against malware on your devices and networks; and (e) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your wallet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with activities that occur on your wallet with or without your authorization.

### Push Notifications

You may agree to receive push notifications from Trust Wallet that will alert you when blockchain networks supported by Trust Wallet are congested and when transactions involving your wallet have been completed. If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing “Settings” and enabling “Push Notifications”.

### Payment and Fees

Fees applicable to the Services or any component of the Services, if any, shall be set forth at trustwallet.com and/or the Trust Wallet mobile application.

### Transaction Fees

There may be transaction fees (e.g. mining fees) associated with your virtual currency transactions that are required by the virtual currency system or blockchain network that you engage with. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or “gas” to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set transaction fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your wallet address. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not have access to your or anyone else’s transactions.

### Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Digital Asset-related transactions.

Third Party Services and Content
--------------------------------

In no event shall a description or reference to a third party’s product or service (including, but not limited to, providing a description or reference via hyperlink) be construed as an endorsement or promotion of such third party products or services by us. We retain the exclusive right to add to, modify, or cancel the availability of any Third Party Service. You may agree to receive push notifications from Third Party Content providers. In order to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service. Push notifications will not be automatically enabled on your device for Third Party Content. We do not control, endorse, or adopt any Third Party Content shared through push notifications, and will have no responsibility for Third Party Content including, but not limited to, token availability and/or sales. If, to the extent permitted by Trust Wallet, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Trust Wallet account, either through the third party’s product or service or through Trust Wallet, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party with access to your wallet.

Intellectual Property
---------------------

Termination

Discount of Services
--------------------

We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice, and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for storing outside of the Services a backup of any wallet address and private key pair that you maintain in your wallet.

Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise.

Severability
------------

If it turns out that any part of this Agreement is invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary.

Arbitration & Waiver of Class Action
------------------------------------

The parties agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from this Agreement or your use of the Services on an individual basis. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

The parties agree that: (a) any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California; and (b) the arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of American Arbitration Association for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, in the English language, and with limited discovery. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available to a court or other tribunal. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES. THE ARBITRAL DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND TRUST WALLET WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

If we are unable to perform our Services outlined in the Terms due to factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the aforementioned force majeure events or changes in applicable laws and/or sanctions policies, we shall not be liable for the Services provided under these Terms during the time period coincident with the event in question.
