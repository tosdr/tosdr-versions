Your personal data which is stored at the Operator may only be accessed by the Operator’s employees as well as the affiliates of the Operator in possession of the required clearance. All persons who have access to such personal data are required to comply with the terms of this Policy and are contractually obliged to keep such information strictly confidential even after appointment within the Operator has been terminated.

The Operator is committed to implementing adequate organizational and technical security measures to protect Your personal data from illegal or accidental access, destruction, alteration, blocking, copying, distribution, as well as other illegal actions from third parties.

**5\. Shared Information**

Information about You and other users is an important part of the Operator’s business and the Operator is not in the business of selling it to third parties. The Operator may however be required to release personal information when it is believed by the Operator that the release is appropriate or necessary to comply with the law or an enforcement order, to enforce or apply the Operator’s agreements or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Operator, the Operator’s users or third-parties, including for fraud protection and credit risk. This excludes selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing Your personal data for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Policy.

To ensure proper provision of Services, the Operator may transfer Your personal data to third parties that provide hosting services, services related to the sending of emails and similar service providers.

The Operator may further transfer Your personal data to any affiliates of the Operator for the purpose of appropriate and high-quality provision and improvement of the Website and the Services and for the performance of the Services and this Policy.

Other than as set out above, You will receive notice when information about You might be transferred to third parties, and You will have an opportunity to choose not to share such information.

The Operator will only transfer personal data to a country outside the EU/EEA (a so-called “third country”) if such third country has an adequate level of personal data protection, or if such transfer is required for conclusion or performance of any Service requested by You, in accordance with the Applicable Law. Where none of the aforementioned applies, such transfer will normally be based on the EU Commission’s standard model clauses for such transfers.
