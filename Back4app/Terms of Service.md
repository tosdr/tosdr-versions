8. Subscriptions



8.1 General



Subject to the Terms, the Services are provided to you for free up to certain limits, as described on our Pricing

Page at https://www.back4app.com/pricing. Usage over these limits requires your purchase of a prepaid

subscription (“Prepaid Subscription”) or a postpaid subscription (“Postpaid Subscription”) in order to access

additional resources or services.



8.2 Prepaid Subscription



If you purchase a Prepaid Subscription, you will be able to access the Services up to the limits described on

the Pricing page or otherwise provided to you at the time of purchase. Once you reach such limits, your

Application’s ability to access and use the Services will be stopped. If you purchase a Prepaid Subscription,

you will be charged the then-applicable Prepaid Subscription fee (“Subscription Fee”) at the beginning of

your Prepaid Subscription and each month, quarter or year thereafter, depending on the term of your

Prepaid Subscription, at the then-current rate. The applicable Subscription Fees are outlined on our Pricing

Page or will otherwise be provided to you at the time of your purchase.



If you purchase a Prepaid Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge

you in accordance with term of your Subscription (e.g., each month, quarter or year), on the calendar day

corresponding to the commencement of your Prepaid Subscription, in accordance with Section 8.4. In the

event your Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be

charged on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you

started a monthly Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and

your payment method would be billed on that date.



8.3 Postpaid Subscription



If you purchase a Postpaid Subscription, you will have unlimited access to the Services, subject to payment

of a fee that is based on your usage of the Services (“Usage Fees”). The applicable Usage Fees are outlined

on our Pricing page or will otherwise be provided to you at the time of your purchase. The Usage Fees will be

charged at the interval indicated to you at the time of purchase (e.g., each month or quarter).If you purchase

a Postpaid Subscription, we (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you the

applicable Usage Fee based on your usage of the Services, as determined by Back4App in its sole discretion,

after the end of the interval over which the Usage Fee was incurred (e.g., each month or quarter). To the

fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to the amount of Usage Fee charged unless you

provide us written notice of a dispute within sixty (60) days of the charge.

8.4 Payments



If you purchase a Prepaid Subscription or Postpaid Subscription (each, a “Subscription”), we may ask you to

supply additional information relevant to your transaction, including, without limitation, your credit-card

number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your address(es) for billing (such information, “Payment

Information”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s)

represented by any such Payment Information. When you purchase a Subscription, you authorize us to provide

your Payment Information to our third party payment processors so we can complete your purchase and to

charge your payment method for the Subscription Fee or Usage Fee (each, a “Fee”) associated with your

Subscription, and any associated taxes. You may, in some cases, need to provide additional information to

verify your identity before completing your transaction (such information is included within the definition of

Payment Information).



BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR

SUBSCRIPTION HAS RECURRING PAYMENT FEATURES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND YOU ACCEPT

RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RECURRING PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO CANCELLATION OF YOUR

SUBSCRIPTION BY YOU OR BACK4APP. We may also periodically authorize your payment method in

anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we

terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.



8.5 Taxes



Unless otherwise stated, the Fees do not include any taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes associated

with your purchases hereunder. If Back4App has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which you are

responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount will be charged to and paid by you.



8.6 Late Payments



If Back4App does not received payment on the applicable payment date, interest will accrue on past due

amounts at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). You will reimburse

Back4App for the reasonable costs of collection in connection with any late payment, including reasonable

fees and expenses of attorneys.

You may cancel your Subscription at any time. PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT ALL SALES ARE FINAL. IF YOU

CANCEL A PREPAID SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION

FEE PAID FOR THE THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION.



To cancel, you can either (i) email us at community@back4app.com and follow any instructions we provide to

you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii) initiate a cancellation through your Account settings within

the Services. You will be responsible for all Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the

then current Subscription period. If you cancel a Prepaid Subscription, we will allow you to access any resources

or services associated with such Subscription until the most recently paid-up Subscription period ends. If you

cancel your Postpaid Subscription, your access to any additional resources or services made under such

subscription will immediately terminate and any accrued Usage Fees will be immediately due. Cancelling your

Subscription won’t cancel your Account. See Section 16 (Termination) below for information on terminating

your Account.

As limited exceptions to Section 21.1 above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it

qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or

enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.



21.3 Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules



The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer

Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are

available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879\. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a

written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA

provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county

(or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator

shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and

scope of this arbitration agreement.



21.4 Arbitration Costs



Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek

to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your

Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and may seek to recover

them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to

the extent provided under applicable law.

21.5 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief



Except as provided in Section 21.2 above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any

claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party

seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To

the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has

the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the

entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in

arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the

outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.



21.6 Class Action Waiver



YOU AND BACK4APP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS

INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR

REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator

may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of

a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of

this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.



21.7 Severability



With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 21.6 of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an

arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable,

the other parts of these Terms will still apply.
