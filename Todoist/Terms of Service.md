You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us either by contacting customer service at [https://todoist.com/contact](https://todoist.com/contact) or [https://twist.com/contact](https://twist.com/contact) (depending on which Doist Service product you are using).

4\. General Payment Terms.
--------------------------

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in the currencies provided on the Doist website and, except as expressly provided by applicable law, are non-refundable, except required by law.

4.1. **Price**. Doist reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Doist will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date which is available on our [pricing page](https://todoist.com/pricing) (the "**Pricing Page**"). All prices are shown on the Pricing Page. Any applicable sales taxes, levies, value-added taxes, or duties imposed by taxing authorities are calculated during the check-out based on your location . We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Doist may change the price of any feature of the Service; if this occurs, Doist will provide you advance notice of the changes before they apply. Doist, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Doist's customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

4.2. **Authorization**. You authorize Doist and its third-party payment processors to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Doist, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Doist or its third-party payment processors may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

4.3. **Subscription Service**. The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges ("**Subscription Service**"). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Doist or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The "**Subscription Billing Date**" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the "**Subscription Fee**", please see our [Pricing Page](https://todoist.com/pricing). Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period (e.g., monthly billing periods will be billed on the same day each month). The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Doist or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by following the instructions provided at the following links for [Todoist Pro](https://todoist.com/help/articles/6039358868380), and [Twist](https://get.twist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115003679665-Billing-FAQ), or by contacting customer service at [https://todoist.com/contact](https://todoist.com/contact) or [https://twist.com/contact](https://twist.com/contact) (depending on which Doist Service product you are using).

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR DOIST ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE DOIST ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMER IN THESE TERMS, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM (A) THE SERVICE; (B) THE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE TEAMS AUTHORIZED USERS THAT YOU INVITE TO YOUR WORKSPACE; (C) YOUR ABILITY OR INABILTITY TO ACCESS, EXPORT, TRANSFER, RETRIEVE, OR REMOVE ANY USER CONTENT FROM ANY WORKSPACE; (C) THE PROCESSING OR USE OF YOUR USER CONTENT BY AN ORGANIZATION; AND (D) YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER, ADMINISTRATOR, OR ORGANIZATION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS, USE, OR DISCLOSURE OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Doist does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Doist is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

19\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DOIST ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY DOIST ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 20.5 (_NOTICE OF ARBITRATION; PROCESS_) AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE DOIST ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO DOIST FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

20\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
---------------------------------------

20.1. **Generally.** In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Doist in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, subject to all applicable laws and except as described in Section 20.2 (_Exceptions_) and 20.3 (_Opt-Out_), you and Doist agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms and your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DOIST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this Section 20 (_Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_) does not affect those requirements.

20.2. **Exceptions.** Despite the provisions of Section 20.1 (_Generally_), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

20.3. **Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 20 (_Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Doist Inc., Attention: Legal Department -- Arbitration Opt-Out, 2100 Geng Road, Suite 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("**Opt-Out Notice**"). Once Doist receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 20 (_Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 21.2 (_Governing Law_). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

20.4. **Arbitrator.** Any arbitration between you and Doist will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "**AAA Rules**") as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Doist. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

20.5. **Notice of Arbitration; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("**Notice of Arbitration**"). Doist's address for Notice is: Doist Inc., 2100 Geng Road, Suite 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("**Demand**"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Doist may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Doist must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Doist in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Doist will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.

20.6. **Fees.** If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Doist will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New Castle County, Delaware, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Doist for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

20.7. **No Class Actions.** YOU AND DOIST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Doist agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

20.8. **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.** If Doist makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Doist's address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Doist's address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Doist will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

20.9. **Enforceability.** If Section 20.7 (_No Class Actions_) or the entirety of this Section 20 (_Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_) is found to be unenforceable, or if Doist receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 20 (_Dispute Resolution and Arbitration_) will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 21.2 (_Governing Law_) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
