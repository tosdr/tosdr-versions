Doist Privacy Policy
====================

Last Update: October 11th, 2024

This privacy policy ("**Policy**") informs you of our practices when handling your Information through the Services (both as defined below). In this Policy, "**Doist**," "**we**," "**our**" or "**us**" refers to Doist Inc., a company registered in Delaware with its registered address located at 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. When you are using Doist Services in your personal capacity, we are the data controller under the applicable privacy laws, and this Policy applies.

When you are using Doist Services as a member of an organization that is a customer of Doist (for example, when accessing a Todoist for teams workspace that relates to your employer if that employer is a Doist customer), we are a data processor under the applicable privacy laws, and that organization is the data controller. In those circumstances, your organization's privacy policy applies, and you should refer to its privacy policy for information about its privacy practices. For clarity, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Please be aware that this Policy does not apply to your activities or any Information that you disclose to your organization, when that organization is the data controller.

For the purpose of this Policy, "**Information**" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. This includes information you provide or generated when you use: (a) our apps, including Todoist and Twist (each an "**App**" and collectively the "**Apps**"); and (b) doist.com and any other dedicated Doist websites, such as todoist.com and twist.com which link to this policy ("**Website**" and together with the "**Apps**" the "**Services**"). When you use the Services, you accept and understand we collect, process, use and store your Information as described in this Policy. **If you do not agree with this Policy, you must not use any of the Services. If you change your mind in the future, you must stop using the Services and you may exercise your rights in relation to your Information as set out in this Policy.**

    * **Information collected via voluntary activities:** for example, when you communicate with us via email, or participate in surveys, we ask you to provide your email address and any Information you choose to provide to allow us to assist you.

We also collect your ratings, opinions, preferences, questions, pictures, and responses associated with that survey.
        
    * **Careers**. If you decide to apply for a job with us, you may submit your contact information and your resume online. We will collect the Information you choose to provide us as part of your job application, such as your contact information, current employment information, and other information you choose to submit with your application and on your resume.

5\. Where we store your Information
-----------------------------------

Your Information will be processed by our employees and service providers in the U.S. If you choose to use our Services from the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United Kingdom ("UK") or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your Information outside of those regions to the U.S. for storage and processing. We may transfer Information from the EEA or the UK to the U.S. and other third countries based on European Commission-approved or UK Government-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or otherwise in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating our Services. You can contact us as detailed below if you want more information about our data transfer practices.

6\. How long we store your Information
--------------------------------------

Your Information is kept for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes set out above. When we process Information for our own purposes, we determine the retention period taking into account various criteria, such as the type of Services provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our Services, the impact on the Services we provide to you if we delete some Information from or about you, and mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations. Generally, we also delete your Information following a valid erasure request (see below Your Rights: Erasure section). Some Information we collect will be stored for longer where we have an overriding legitimate interest to retain such Information (for example, Information on suspicious behaviour of certain users of our Services and transaction records).

When deleting Information, we will take measures to make the Information irrecoverable or irreproducible, and electronic files which contain Information will be deleted permanently.

7\. Your rights

Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable Information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain Information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.

In the case you want to obtain this information, please contact customer service at [https://todoist.com/contact](https://todoist.com/contact) or [https://twist.com/contact](https://twist.com/contact), (depending on which Doist Service product you are using). The right to access is not absolute. For example, we cannot reveal trade secrets, or give you Information about other individuals.

* **Erasure.** You have the right to delete your account and erase your Information and upon [deleting your account](https://todoist.com/help/articles/203799822), all your Information will be removed from our production systems. Usually, only an encrypted copy of your Information will remain on our backup archives for 90 days, although we reserve the right to retain some of your Information where there are valid grounds for us to do so under data protection laws. For example, for the defence of legal claims, respect freedom of expression, or where we have an overriding legitimate interest to do so.
    
    Note that where the Information is held by a third party data controller, such as a payment processor, we will use reasonable steps to inform them of your request, but we recommend you contact them directly in accordance with their own privacy policies to ensure your personal data is erased.
    
* **Objection.** You may have the right to object to our processing of you Information. This is the case where we process such Information on the basis of our legitimate interests (see above under [How we use your personal information](https://doist.com/privacy#2-how-we-use-your-personal-information) section), or where the Information is used for direct marketing purposes. You may exercise this right as follows:
    
* To stop receiving marketing newsletters: You may withdraw your consent through the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each communication.
    
* To stop our cookies being placed for either advertising or analytics purposes: please change your device or browser settings.
    
* To object to all other processing based on our legitimate interests, please contact us at [https://todoist.com/contact](https://todoist.com/contact). Please note that we may have an overriding legitimate interest to keep processing your Information, but we will let you know where this is the case.
