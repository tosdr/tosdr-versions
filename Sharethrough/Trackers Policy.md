You may also notify us through the “[Contact Information](#18)“ section below of any changes or errors in any Personal Data we have about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. We may also not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
* **Restrictions.** You have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances. In particular, you can request we restrict our use of it if you contest its accuracy, if the processing of your Personal Data is determined to be unlawful, or if we no longer need your Personal Data for processing but we have retained it as permitted by law.
* **Portability.** To the extent the Personal Data you provide Sharethrough is processed based on your consent and that we process it through automated means, you have the right to request that we provide you a copy of, or access to, all or part of such Personal Data in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit this Personal Data to another controller, when technically feasible.
* **Withdrawal of Consent.** To the extent that our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account.

In some cases, we cannot delete your Personal Data except by also deleting your employer’s account.

These will be retained for the periods set forth in our disaster recovery policies.
* **Complaints.** You have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority in the country you live in, the country you work in, or the country where you believe your rights under applicable data protection laws have been violated.

Please note that if you make unfounded, repetitive, or excessive requests (as determined in our reasonable discretion) to access your Personal Data, you may be charged a fee subject to a maximum set by applicable law.

### 12\. Jurisdiction Privacy Rights

The law in certain jurisdictions may provide their residents with additional rights regarding our use of your Personal Data.

The law in some states may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of Personal Data. To learn more about any additional rights that may be applicable to you as a resident of one of these jurisdictions, please see the privacy addendum for your jurisdiction that is attached to this Advertising Platform Privacy Notice, if any.

### 13\. Do Not Track Signals

We may use automated data collection technologies to track you across online services. We currently do not honor do-not-track signals that may be sent by some browsers.

We also may use automated data collection technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). Some web browsers permit you to broadcast a signal to websites and online services indicating a preference that they “do not track” your online activities. At this time, we do not honor such signals and we do not modify what information we collect or how we use that information based upon whether such a signal is broadcast or received by us.

### 14\. Data Security

Information transmitted over the Internet is not completely secure, but we do our best to protect your Personal Data. You can help protect your Personal Data and other information by keeping your password to our Platform confidential. 

We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to our Platform. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures deployed on the Platform.

### 15\. Consent to Processing of Personal Data in Other Countries Outside of Your Home Country

We may process your Personal Data outside of your home country, including to the United States. We only do this when we are legally permitted to do so and when we have appropriate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Data. 

In order to permit you and your employer use and access of our Platform, we may send and store your Personal Data outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide an equivalent level of protection for your Personal Data. Your information may be processed and stored in the United States and in Canada and United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial, and local governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the United States or Canada. By using our Platform, you represent that you have read and understood the above and hereby consent to the storage and processing of Personal Data outside the country where you reside or are located, including in the United States and Canada.

Your Personal Data is transferred by Sharethrough to another country only if it is required or permitted under applicable data protection law and provided that there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect your Personal Data. To ensure your Personal Data is treated in accordance with this Advertising Platform Privacy Notice when we transfer it to a third party, Sharethrough uses Data Protection Agreements between Sharethrough and all other recipients of your data where required by law. These Data Protection Agreements include, where applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (the “**Standard Contractual Clauses**”). The European Commission has determined that the transfer of Personal Data pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses provides for an adequate level of protection of your Personal Data, but may need to be supplemented with additional measures on a case-by-case basis after an analysis that such supplemental measures can provide you with an essentially equivalent level of protection as afforded in the EU. When, as a result of this analysis, we believe this to be appropriate and necessary, these Standard Contractual Clauses have been supplemented in this way. Under these Standard Contractual Clauses, you have the same rights as if your data was not transferred to such third country. When applicable, you may request a copy of the Data Protection Agreement by contacting us through the “[Contact Information](#18)” section below.

### 16\. Data Retention Periods

We retain your Personal Data for as long as you keep your account open. In some instances, we may keep it after you close your account, for example we may keep it:

* on our backup and disaster recovery systems;
* for as long as necessary to protect our legal interests; and
* and to comply with other legal requirements.

Sharethrough will retain your Personal Data for the entire time that your account remains open with your employer and you are provided access to it. After your account is closed, we may retain your Personal Data for one (1), or for any of the reasons listed below, whichever is longer:

* for as long as necessary to comply with any legal requirement; 
* on our backup and disaster recovery systems in accordance with our backup and disaster recovery policies and procedures;
* for as long as necessary to protect our legal interests or otherwise pursue our legal rights and remedies; and
* for data that has been aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous in such a manner that you are no longer identifiable, indefinitely.

### 17\. Changes to Our Advertising Platform Privacy Notice

We will post any changes to our Advertising Platform Privacy Notice on our Platform. If we make material changes to our Advertising Platform Privacy Notice, we may notify you of such changes through your contact information and invite you to review (and accept, if necessary) the changes. 

We may change this Advertising Platform Privacy Notice at any time. It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Advertising Platform Privacy Notice on this page with a notice that the Advertising Platform Privacy Notice has been updated on the Platform’ home page. If we make material changes to how we treat our Platform users’ Personal Data, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account and through a notice on the Platform’ home page. The date this Advertising Platform Privacy Notice was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
