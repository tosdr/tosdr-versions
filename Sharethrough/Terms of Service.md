(“Sharethrough”), and the Publisher identified on the Order Form (“Publisher”), for the provisions of services in accordance with the following terms and conditions. Sharethrough and Publisher may be referred to in these Terms of Service individually as a “Party” and together as the “Parties.”  

**UPON EXECUTING AN ORDER FORM THAT REFERENCES THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, OR BY OTHERWISE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, PUBLISHER AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DATA PROCESSING ADDENDUM AVAILABLE AT** [**HTTPS://WWW.SHARETHROUGH.COM/DATA-PROCESSING-ADDENDUM**](https://www.sharethrough.com/data-processing-addendum)**, INCLUDING SIGNING THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES AS APPLICABLE.** When used herein the term “Agreement” includes the body of these Terms of Service, all Order Forms, and all addendums, exhibits, and attachments hereto or referenced herein. In the event of a conflict between the body of these Terms of Service and an Order Form, addendum, exhibit, schedule, or other attachment, the body of these Terms of Service shall govern. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the French and English versions of this Agreement, the English version shall prevail. For purposes of this Agreement, “Order Form” means one or more duly signed and executed Sharethrough publisher agreement subscription ordering documents which reference these Terms of Service and all Order Forms are hereby incorporated herein.  

### 1\. Term

**1.1. Subscription Term; Renewals.** The term of this Agreement shall commence on the earlier of the Effective Date or Publisher’s first use of the Platform and continue in full force for twelve (12) months or until the termination of all outstanding Order Forms in accordance with the subscription period set forth on the relevant Order Form (the “Term”). Except as otherwise stated in an Order Form, subscriptions will automatically renew for additional twelve (12) month periods.

Platform subscriptions will automatically renew for additional twelve (12) month periods.

### 2\. Access to Platform

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sharethrough grants to Publisher a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited subscription license for Publisher and its End Users (defined below) to access and use Sharethrough’s programmatic advertising platform as described on the Order Form (the “Platform”) for Publisher’s advertisement serving business purposes on its domains, applications, and other digital assets specified in the Order Form (collectively, the “Sites”) solely in accordance with Sharethrough’s Documentation (defined below). Publisher’s authorized use of the Platform includes: (i) the purposes of receiving and displaying the advertisements or Publisher content delivered by Sharethrough into the Sites (“Ad Impressions”); (ii) deploying cookies created by Sharethrough and/or a third party, including Sharethrough’s demand/DSP and fraud partners to assigned visitor computers or devices in order to communicate through Sharethrough’s ad server (“Unique User Identifiers”); and (iii) employing Sharethrough ad tags ((i)- (iii), collectively, the “Services”). Sharethrough’s cookies, ad tags, and other similar automated technologies provided by Sharethrough for the purpose of targeting advertising to consumers is referred to herein as “Sharethrough AdTech.” For purposes of this Agreement, “End Users” means Publisher’s employees, contractors, and representatives who are authorized to access the Platform on Publisher’s behalf, and for which Publisher will remain liable and responsible. Publisher may, as agreed to in writing by Sharethrough, offer access to the Platform to any subsidiaries, parent corporations, or affiliate entities of Publisher and Publisher shall be liable and responsible for all access and use by such entities.

### 3\. Restrictions

Publisher and its End Users may only use the Platform as described in this Agreement and in the then-current documentation, applicable guidelines available at [https://www.sharethrough.com/sharethrough-supply-policy](https://www.sharethrough.com/sharethrough-supply-policy) ("Sharethrough Supply Policy”), specifications, and instructions regarding the Platform, including online help screens contained within the Platform, made generally available by Sharethrough to its customers, as modified from time to time by Sharethrough in its sole discretion (the “Documentation”). Publisher’s use of the Platform is subject to prior approval by Sharethrough and is limited to previously approved Sites. Sharethrough reserves the right to refuse service to new or existing Sites, at its sole discretion. Publisher is responsible for ensuring its End Users comply with all relevant terms of this Agreement and any failure to comply will constitute a breach by Publisher. Except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, Publisher will not, and will not allow any End User or other third party to, (i) decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, distribute, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the trade secrets embodied in the Platform, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, (ii) rent or lease any rights in the Platform in any form to any person, (iii) use the Platform or any Sharethrough Confidential Information to develop a competing product or service, (iv) use the Platform, or allow the transfer, transmission, export, or re-export of the Platform or portion thereof, in violation of any export control laws or regulations administered by any government agency, or (v) remove, minimize, block, or modify any copyright, trademark, proprietary rights, disclaimer, digital watermark, or warning notice included on or embedded in any part of the Documentation or Platform, including any screen displays, or any other products or materials provided by Sharethrough hereunder. Publisher shall comply with all export control laws and regulations, such as, but not limited to laws administered by OFAC or any other governmental entity imposing economic sanctions and trade embargoes (“Economic Sanctions Laws”) against designated countries (“Embargoed Countries”), regimes, entities, and persons (collectively, “Embargoed Targets”). Publisher is not an Embargoed Target or otherwise subject to any Economic Sanctions Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Publisher shall not without the required export approvals, transmit, directly or indirectly, any information nor make any of the Services provided by Sharethrough available to any location or person to which the transmission is prohibited by such applicable laws. Under no circumstances will Sharethrough be liable or responsible for any use, or any results obtained by the use, of the Platform in conjunction with any services, software, or hardware that are not provided by Sharethrough. All such use will be at Publisher’s sole risk and liability. Sharethrough reserves the right to modify the Platform for any reason, without notice and without liability to Publisher or any End User, to comply with applicable law.

### 4\. Subsequent Versions or New Offerings

If, during the Term, Sharethrough makes available to its customers generally any future update, version, or release of the Platform, Sharethrough shall provide the update, version, or release to Publisher at no additional charge. Sharethrough may update the Platform, rebrand the Platform, or replace the Platform with a new, substantially similar, or enhanced service offering, in its discretion from time to time during the Term. For the avoidance of doubt, Sharethrough may charge additional fees for functions, features, or modules not included in the version of the Platform marketed by Sharethrough and provided to Publisher as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.

### 5\. Telephone and Email Support

During the Term, Sharethrough will provide Publisher with reasonable telephone and email support during Sharethrough’s then current business hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. EST.

### 6\. Revenue Sharing Terms and Other Expenses

**6.1. Revenue Sharing Terms.** The Parties will share in the revenue generated by or in connection with the Platform, including any advertising served to Publisher’s customers through the Platform (“Revenue Sharing”). Sharethrough shall pay to Publisher an amount equal to the revenue billed to, and actually collected from, advertisers by Sharethrough in a given calendar month from advertisements displayed on the Publisher Sites via the Platform, less the Sharethrough revenue share, ad-serving fees, and any other applicable fees, costs, and expenses (herein the “Net Earningsʺ). For avoidance of doubt, Sharethrough will not have any obligation to pay Publisher based on amounts that it has not yet collected from the applicable advertisers. Sharethrough shall have the sole responsibility for calculating and reporting all statistics, including impressions, clicks, and earnings, revenue, and Net Earnings. Net Earnings will be calculated on a monthly basis. Sharethrough shall pay Publisher only for those months in which Net Earnings exceed one hundred ($100) US dollars. Any Net Earnings that are not paid to Publisher in any month will be credited to Publisher towards the Net Earnings for the next month and paid by Sharethrough to Publisher once accrued Net Earnings exceed one hundred ($100) dollars. Net Earnings shall be paid to Publisher in accordance with the payment terms, currency, and Revenue Sharing rates agreed to by the Parties in the applicable Order Form. If Sharethrough collects revenue in a currency other than the one agreed to by the Parties in the applicable Order Form, Publisher agrees that Sharethrough will convert such sums using the exchange rates that Sharethrough uses for transactions made for its own account. Publisher must raise any issues regarding the Net Earnings in writing to Sharethrough within ten (10) days of receipt of the relevant Net Earnings. If Publisher fails to provide Sharethrough with such timely notice then Publisher hereby waives its right to dispute any such amounts. Sharethrough reserves the right to withhold payment from the Publisher in the event of any violation by Publisher of this Agreement.  

**6.2. Taxes.** Publisher shall be responsible for those sales, use, and similar taxes associated with its use of the Platform and any Revenue Sharing received by Publisher, excluding taxes based on Sharethrough’s real property, personal property, income, personnel.

**6.4. Fees and Earnings; Google Open Bidding.** Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contrary in this Agreement, for Publishers utilizing Google Open Bidding, Publisher’s sole remedy for payments is via its relationship with Google. Sharethrough reserves the right to enforce credits and/or deductions directly with Publisher to the extent this Agreement creates such a credit. Sharethrough will pay to Google, Inc. the sum of the cleared price after the auction has been run for a given ad opportunity, which will be calculated using a first-price or second-price auction depending on the type of bid submitted of won and rendered Ad Impressions. Google, Inc. may pay a portion of these funds to Publisher.

### 7\. Publisher Responsibilities

**7.1. Publisher Technology.** Publisher shall be responsible for obtaining, installing, inter-connecting, and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Platform, including modems, hardware, servers, software, operating systems, networking, connectivity, and web servers, all Publisher website(s), and all ad serving software, programming, specifications, and other technologies (collectively, “Publisher Technology”).

If Publisher intends to use the Platform for multiple Ad Impressions, whether on different Sites, different sections on one Site, or within the same page on one Site, Publisher must request and employ separate ad tags for each Ad Impression. Publisher is solely responsible for the correct insertion of each issued ad tag. Publisher shall not modify, edit, amend, truncate, alter, bypass, or reorder any aspect of the ads on the Platform or the Ad Impressions provided by Sharethrough. Publisher is solely responsible for the language, customization, and accuracy of Publisher’s Site content in which Ad Impressions appear, and for all materials and content related to the delivery of Ad Impressions to the ad placement areas.

Publisher shall not (and shall not permit any third party to) in any way block, disable, alter, or interfere with such link. Additionally, for any third party ad demand, Sharethrough will place a privacy policy and behavioral targeting opt-out icon, as required, in the native ad placement areas and/or on its website.  

**7.5. Fraud.** Publisher agrees that it shall not generate, facilitate, or encourage any Ad Impressions in exchange for any benefit paid, or through any pay-to-click programs, “bots,” or other fraudulent traffic including repeated ad clicks or impressions generated by one or more users, text or incentives used to encourage visitors to click on ads, automated clicking tools, or any other traffic sources or other deceptive software (“**Invalid Traffic**”), and acknowledges and agrees that none of the foregoing impressions shall be counted toward Publisher earnings. Publisher hereby acknowledges Publisher’s use of the Platform will be continuously monitored by Sharethrough and various third-party fraud track technology. If Sharethrough determines that there has been Invalid Traffic or Publisher has otherwise failed to comply with this Section 7.5 (Fraud), Sharethrough may immediately terminate or suspend Publisher’s use of the Platform at its sole discretion and all fees generated from such actions will be forfeited.  

**7.6. Ads.txt File.** Publisher shall maintain an ads.txt file on any Sites they monetize with Sharethrough listing the valid supply paths for their programmatic inventory, including Sharethrough and other partners they use. Publisher shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assure that only known valid supply path partners are listed in its ads.txt file. Ads.txt file shall comply with the then-current ads.txt standard, as may be amended from time to time by the IAB Technology Laboratory.  

**7.7. Privacy.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that they may only process personal data as set out under Schedule A: Data Processing Addendum (the “DPA"), which is hereby incorporated under these Terms of Service, and available at [https://www.sharethrough.com/data-processing-addendum](https://www.sharethrough.com/data-processing-addendum).

Confidential Information.** Each Party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has disclosed or may disclose business, technical, or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information” of the Disclosing Party). Confidential Information of Sharethrough includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Platform. The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information, and (ii) not to use (except in performance of Services, provision of the Platform, or as otherwise permitted herein) or divulge to any third person any such Confidential Information.

The Receiving Party will cooperate with and provide assistance to the Disclosing Party regarding such measures. Notwithstanding any such compelled disclosure by the Receiving Party, such compelled disclosure will not otherwise affect the Receiving Party’s obligations hereunder with respect to Confidential Information so disclosed.

Non-Exclusive Equitable Remedy.** Each Party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of Confidential Information there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach or threatened breach may allow a Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the other Party resulting in irreparable harm to such Party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, each Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable remedies, and may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving actual loss, in addition to whatever remedies either of them might have at law or equity. Any breach of this Section 9 (Confidentiality; Proprietary Rights) will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement in the exclusive discretion of the non-breaching Party.

### 10\. Indemnification

Publisher agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sharethrough and its affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, members, subsidiaries, and successors in interest from and against any claim, action, proceeding, liability, loss, damage, cost, or expense, including attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and court costs, arising out of or based on (a) Publisher Data, (b) Publisher’s unauthorized use of the Platform, (c) Publisher’s breach of any covenants, representations, or warranties hereunder, including Sections 7.7 (Privacy) and 8.2 (Publisher’s Warranty), (d) Publisher’s violation of applicable law, including any Privacy and Data Protection Requirements, or (e) Publisher’s negligence, willful misconduct, or fraudulent acts or omissions. Sharethrough shall: (i) give Publisher prompt written notice of an indemnified claim; and (ii) allow Publisher to control, and fully cooperate with Publisher (at Publisher’s sole expense) in, the defense and all related negotiations. Publisher shall not enter into any stipulated judgment or settlement that purports to bind Sharethrough without Sharethrough’s express written authorization, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

THE TOTAL AGGREGATED LIABILITY OF SHARETHROUGH AND ITS VENDORS, OR LICENSORS TO PUBLISHER OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR USE OF THE PLATFORM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM OR TYPE OF DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT PAYABLE TO PUBLISHER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY REVENUE SHARE RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE, OR (B) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

### 12\. Third Party Services and Material

Sharethrough may source Ad Impressions from third party services in connection with its provision of the Platform and related Services.

The Platform and Documentation may contain third party data, content, material, or information, or content, products, services, or links to other independent third-party web sites, applications, or tools (“Third Party Material”). Sharethrough does not control Third Party Material and is not responsible for its content. Sharethrough’s inclusion of Third Party Material in the Platform or accessibility of Third Party Material through the Platform does not imply any endorsement of the information and Sharethrough makes no representations or warranties with respect to any Third Party Material. If Publisher or its End Users are subject to or required to agree to any third party software licenses, consents, user agreements, privacy notices, or other third party policies or terms and conditions, Publisher shall be responsible for complying with such third party requirements and for compliance by its End Users.

Sharethrough will use reasonable efforts to provide Publisher with notice prior to or promptly following any suspension.

**14.2. Independent Contractor.** Sharethrough is an independent contractor and is not an agent or employee of, and has no authority to bind, Publisher by contract or otherwise. Further, it is not the intention of this Agreement or of the Parties to confer a third-party beneficiary right of action upon any third party or entity whatsoever, and nothing in this Agreement will be construed so as to confer upon any third party or entity other than the Parties hereto a right of action under this Agreement or in any manner whatsoever.

**14.4. Assignment.** Publisher may not assign, transfer, or delegate its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Sharethrough. All the terms and provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their successors, assigns, and legal representatives.  

**14.5. Force Majeure.** If either Party cannot perform any of its obligations because of any act of God, court order, war, or any other cause not within the Party’s reasonable control and arising after the Effective Date and which could not be avoided through the exercise of reasonable care and diligence (a “Force Majeure Event”), then the non-performing Party will: (i) immediately notify the other Party; (ii) take reasonable steps to resume performance as soon as possible; and (iii) not be considered in breach during the duration of the Force Majeure Event.

**14.7. Waivers.** All waivers hereunder must be made in writing by a duly authorized representative of the Party against whom the waiver is to operate, and failure at any time to require the other Party’s performance of any obligation under this Agreement shall not affect the right subsequently to require performance of that obligation. Any waiver, in whole or in part, of any provision of this Agreement will not be considered to be a waiver of any other provision.  

**14.8. Severability.** If any term of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, all other terms will remain in full force and effect.  

**14.9. Construction.** All headings used in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. All personal pronouns used herein, whether used in the feminine, masculine, or neuter gender, shall include all other genders, and the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the words “herein,” “hereof,” and “hereunder” and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section, Subsection or other subpart. The words “include,” “includes,” “included,” “including,” “without limitation,” or the phrase “e.g.” shall not be construed as terms of limitation and shall, in all instances, be interpreted as meaning “including, but not limited to.”

**14.12. Modifications.** Sharethrough reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time by posting the revised terms to the Sharethrough website at [https://www.sharethrough.com/privacy-center/publisher-platform-terms-of-service](https://www.sharethrough.com/privacy-center/publisher-platform-terms-of-service#14) or by emailing you. Changes will automatically be incorporated into this Agreement as of such date. Publisher’s continued use of the Platform means that Publisher has accepted the changed terms.

Either Party may change its address or designee for notification purposes by giving notice to the other of the new address or designee and the date upon which such change will become effective.  

**14.14. Legal Fees.** If any dispute arises between the Parties with respect to the matters covered by this Agreement which leads to a proceeding to resolve such dispute, the prevailing Party in such proceeding will be entitled to receive its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees, and out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such proceeding, in addition to any other relief it may be awarded.

**14.16. Counterparts.** This Agreement, including Order Forms and related documents, may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and will become effective and binding upon the Parties as of the Effective Date at such time as all the signatories hereto have signed a counterpart of this Agreement.  

**14.17. Electronic Signatures and Facsimiles Binding.** This Agreement, including Order Forms and related documents, may be accepted in electronic form (e.g., by an electronic or digital signature or other means of demonstrating assent) and Publisher’s acceptance will be deemed binding between the Parties. Publisher acknowledges and agrees it will not contest the validity or enforceability of this Agreement including Order Forms and related documents, including under any applicable statute of frauds, because they were accepted and/or signed in electronic form. Publisher further acknowledges and agrees that it will not contest the validity or enforceability of an electronically accepted or signed copy of this Agreement and related documents on the basis that it lacks an original handwritten signature. Electronic, PDF, or facsimile signatures shall be considered valid signatures as of the date hereof.
