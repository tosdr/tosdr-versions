Sharethrough Ad Exchange Supply Policy  

=========================================

As an ad exchange, Sharethrough is a digital marketplace that enables advertisers and publishers to buy and sell advertising space. _Last Updated: June 28, 2022._

Supply Policy
-------------

As one of the top independent omnichannel ad exchanges in the world, the **Sharethrough Ad Exchange** (“Sharethrough”) connects advertisers & publishers by leveraging their unique technology to enhance every impression by rendering a higher-performing banner, video, CTV or native ad that dynamically fits into any placement on any domain, application and other digital asset (collectively, the “Site”).

The following policy (“Policy”) applies to all **Supply Partners** (“Partner”) using Sharethrough to monetize its, and/or its partners’ inventory on Sites. This Policy sets forth the guidelines all Partners must adhere to.  

Sharethrough retains the right to deny at any time any Sites that do not comply with the below guidelines.

### **1\. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES**

#### **A. Sites & Domains**

* Traffic from Sites should come from a balance of different sources, with an emphasis on direct traffic;
* Sites submitted to Sharethrough must have a majority of traffic from the US, the UK, Canada and the EMEA;
* The Partner must have ownership of the Sites or permission from the owner to use the Sites;
* Inventory sources cannot be a link farm, content farm, scraper site or any similar type of website;
* Inventory sources must be original content and include transparent references to the operators or owners of the Sites; 
* Partners wishing to onboard new domains, must be **sellers.json** and **ads.txt** compliant;
* The Sites may not use Sharethrough logos or trademarks, or mention or refer to Sharethrough, in any manner, without Sharethrough’s prior written consent.

#### **B. Placements on Partner Sites**

* Sharethrough placements on Partner Sites should be set directly in the ad server and should limit its iFrame depth and passbacks. The iFrame cannot be obscured or altered;
* Sites must have suitable content to ad slot ratio per page. As a reference, ads should not take up more than 30% of a website;
* Ad refresh timeouts should be set to 30 seconds or higher and only refresh when the ad unit is in view. Partner must keep the number, layout or refresh rate on a page the same no matter where the visitor to the Site originates.

#### **C. Inventory Quality**

* Sharethrough does not allow adware, toolbar, or other undesirable inventory sources;
* Sites cannot initiate a download or change settings without the end user’s knowledge and consent;
* Partner shall not mask or cloak a Site’s URL or employ other means to obscure the true source of traffic;
* Sites should have little to no Invalid Traffic (“IVT”). Sharethrough has the unequivocal right to use IVT monitoring partners to review inventory for quality and prevent fraudulent traffic;
* Sites shall not simulate or artificially initiate clicks, impressions or conversions or source traffic from forced redirects;
* Partners buying inventory from third party ad networks shall not resell it (arbitrage);
* Partner shall not edit or modify ads.

### **2\. BANNED CONTENT**
