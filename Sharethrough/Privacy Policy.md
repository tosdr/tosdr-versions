This Privacy Policy describes how Sharethrough Inc. and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and related entities (collectively, “**Sharethrough**,” “**we**,” or “**us**“) collect and use Personal Information about you during the employment application and recruitment process.

**For clarity, Personal Information refers to any information that directly or indirectly identifies you (such as your name, email address, contact information, resume, and any other information you disclose to us in the employment process). Personal Information as referred to in this policy includes the definitions of “Personal Data” and “Personally Identifiable Information,” (collectively “**Personal Information**,”) as defined by applicable privacy laws applicable in all jurisdictions where Sharethrough operates.**

This Privacy Policy applies only to job applicants (not Sharethrough’s current employees) worldwide, including those candidates located in Canada, the United Kingdom (“**UK**”), within Europe, the United States, and other global regions in accordance with applicable privacy laws.

This Privacy Policy describes the categories of Personal Information that we collect, how we use your Personal Information, how we secure your Personal Information, when we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties, and when we may transfer your Personal Information outside of your home jurisdiction. This Privacy Policy also describes your rights regarding the Personal Information that we hold about you and how you can access, correct, and request erasure of your Personal Information.

We will only use your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless otherwise required by applicable law. We take steps to ensure that the Personal Information that we collect about you is adequate, relevant, not excessive, and used for limited purposes. 

### 3\. **Collection of Personal Information**

Sharethrough may collect Personal Information directly from you, as a job applicant, or may receive Personal Information from third parties, for example, in connection with a background, employment, or reference verification, subject to your consent where required by law (e.g., Linkedin). We may collect, store, and use the following non- exhaustive categories of Personal Information in connection with our recruiting activities:

* Reference information and information received from background and reference verifications, where applicable, including information provided by third parties;
* Information related to previous applications to Sharethrough or previous employment history with Sharethrough.

### 4\. **Use of Your Personal Information**

We may use your Personal Information for the following legitimate business purposes:

* Identifying and evaluating your job application, including assessing skills, qualifications, and interests;
* Verifying your information and carrying out employment, background, and reference verifications, where applicable, subject to your consent;

* To comply with our legal, regulatory, or other corporate governance requirements;
* Analyzing and improving our application and recruitment process;
* Complying with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable government requests;
* To protect the rights and property of Sharethrough, other job applicants, employees, or the public, as required or permitted by law.

In addition to using your Personal Information for the position for which you have applied, we may retain and use your Personal Information to inform you about and consider you for other positions that may be appropriate for you in accordance with our document retention policy. If you do not want to be considered for other positions or would like us to remove your Personal Information, you may contact us as specified below under [Contact Us](#contact-us).

We only use your Personal Information where applicable law permits or requires it in connection with carrying out our application and recruitment process. We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes we collected it for. If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will provide notice to you and, if required by law, seek your consent.

### 5\. **Personal Information Sharing**

We will only disclose your Personal Information to third parties where required by law or to our employees, contractors, designated agents, or third-party service providers who require it to assist us with administering the recruitment process, including third-party service providers who provide services to us or on our behalf. We may use third-party service providers for various purposes, including, but not limited to, obtaining employment verification and background checks.

We may also disclose your Personal Information for the following additional purposes where permitted or required by applicable law:

* As part of our regular reporting activities to other members of our group of companies;
* To comply with legal obligations or valid legal processes such as search warrants, subpoenas, or court orders. When we disclose your Personal Information to comply with a legal obligation or legal process, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only disclose the minimum Personal Information necessary for the specific purpose and circumstances;
* During emergency situations or where necessary to protect the safety of persons;
* Where the Personal Information is publicly available;
* If a business transfer or change in ownership occurs;
* For additional purposes with your consent where such consent is required by law.

### 6\. **Cross-Border Transfers**

Sharethrough is a global company. Where applicable law permits, we may transfer the Personal Information we collect about you to jurisdictions outside your home country. If we transfer your Personal data outside of your home country, we will ensure we take the appropriate measures to ensure your information is transferred in a secure manner. These measures are subject to the legal requirements of the jurisdictions to which we transfer Personal Information, including lawful requirements to disclose information to law enforcement and government agencies in those countries.

_European Data Protection Regulations  
_We ensure any international transfers of your Personal data are compliant with the laws of that region, including the European _General Data Protection Regulation_ (the “**GDPR”**). Specifically, with respect to the European Economic Area (“**EEA”**), we ensure appropriate legal protections are in place if we transfer your Personal data outside of the EEA to the United Kingdom (“**UK”**), Switzerland, or any other country, as provided for under European data protection legislation.

These protections include using technical security measures or a legal mechanism, such as, but not limited to, the Standard Contractual Clauses (“**SCC”**), which are approved by the European Commission. The SCCs standardize the protections for any international transfers of your data from the EEA to other countries, thus providing you with assurance that you will be able to access your rights for the protection of Personal data in a manner consistent with European data protection law.

### 7\. **Personal Information Security**

We have implemented appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security measures designed to secure your Personal Information against accidental loss and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. In addition, we limit Personal Information access to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties that have a legitimate business need for such access.

### 8\. **Personal Information Retention**

**Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will retain your Personal Information for up to three (3) years following the completion of the hiring process, or for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. This allows you to inquire about our hiring process should you wish to do so. Under some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent.**

**If you are offered and accept employment with Sharethrough, the Personal Information we collect during the application and recruitment process will become part of your employment record, and we may use it in connection with your employment consistent with our employee Personal Information policies.**

**If you do not become an employee, or, once you are no longer an employee of Sharethrough, we will retain and securely destroy your Personal Information in accordance with our document retention policy and applicable laws and regulations.**
