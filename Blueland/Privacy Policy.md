### PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND

  
The ways in which we process your personal information may vary based on our relationship with you. Please see the sections above titled “How We Use Your Personal Information” and “Privacy Rights for Residents of California and Certain Other States” for a description of the ways that we process your personal information and how long we retain it, based on the types of interactions you have with us.

  
The legal bases for which we may process personal information of residents of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are listed below:

* The performance of any contractual relationship we have with you
* Where it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations
* Where you have provided your consent to certain types of processing
* Where it is in our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of our partners, affiliates, clients, and service providers (provided these are not overridden by your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms), such as:
    * To provide our products and services
    * To respond to your requests and inquiries
    * To administer our business, including marketing and analysis
    * To prevent and detect fraud or security threats
    * To comply with applicable laws, regulations or ethical obligations

  
We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, while we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, no data transmission or storage is 100% safe. We do not retain personal information for longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill the business purpose(s) for which it was collected, with some exceptions (e.g., for security purposes or complying with our legal obligations).

**  
Transferring Data Abroad**

  
Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have offices or servers or in which we engage service providers, including in the United States, which may have different data protection and data processing laws than those in your country. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing, and processing. Our internal policies require all of our offices to comply with this Privacy Policy and ensure a level of protection for personal information at least as protective as that mandated by the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Any such transfer shall take place only in accordance with and as permitted by the law of your jurisdiction. In all cases, we shall apply the provisions of this Privacy Policy to your personal information wherever it is located.

**  
Your Rights**

  
Residents of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have the right to receive or reasonably access the personal information that we process, request a portable copy of that information, and the ability to review, correct, delete, restrict, or object to the processing of such information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information at any time by using the contact information at the bottom of this section.

  
All of these rights are subject to certain conditions and exemptions. Although we make good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to when it would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy, or when the information is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will endeavor to provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.

  
If you would like to exercise your privacy rights, please let us know by contacting us at the information below.  

Residents of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom may report privacy complaints directly to their local data protection authorities. See https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index\_en.htm for more information. You may also contact us to be directed to the relevant authorities for your jurisdiction.  

**CHANGES**

  
We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please check back regularly to ensure you have up-to-date notice.

  
This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 12, 2024.
