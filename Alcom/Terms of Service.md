1. INTRODUCTION, ARBITRATION NOTICE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER
    ------------------------------------------------------
    
    This User Agreement explains your rights and obligations in accessing, visiting and/or using the [Service](#service), brought to you by Advance Local and its Local Media Groups. This User Agreement does not apply to websites, apps, destinations, or other offerings that we do not own or control, even if they are linked to from the Service. All capitalized terms used in this User Agreement that are not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the [Glossary.](#glossary)
    
    You can access this User Agreement any time in the footer of the Service's home page, via the menu button/hamburger icon or on the Service description screen, or as otherwise indicated depending on the Service you are using. **By purchasing a [Product](#product), registering for any aspect of the Service, or otherwise accessing, visiting or using the Service, you consent and agree to be bound by the terms of this User Agreement.** If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this User Agreement, you should not access, visit and/or use the Service, or request or receive a Product. We advise that you print or retain a digital copy of this User Agreement for future reference.
    
    In addition to reviewing this User Agreement, please also review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.al.com/privacy-policy/) and any other terms and conditions that may be posted elsewhere in the Service or otherwise communicated to our users, because the Privacy Policy and all such terms and conditions are also part of the [Agreement](#agreement) between you and us.
    
    This User Agreement may be modified from time to time, so check back often. So that you are aware changes have been made, we will adjust the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of this document. If we make a material change to this User Agreement, we will also post on the Service a prominent notice that a change was made. Continued access, visitation and/or use of the Service by you, or continued receipt of a Product, will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the User Agreement.
    
    ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN [SECTION VIII(G)](#legal_7) BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. READ MORE IN [SECTION VIII(G)](#legal_7) BELOW.
    
    If you breach, violate, fail to follow, or act inconsistently with any part of the Agreement, we may terminate, discontinue, suspend, and/or restrict your account/profile, your ability to access, visit, and/or use the Service or any portion thereof, and/or the Agreement, including without limitation any of our purported obligations hereunder, with or without notice, in addition to our other remedies. In addition, we may curtail, restrict, or refuse to provide you with any future access, visitation, and/or use of the Service or any Product. We reserve the right, in addition to our other remedies, to take any technical, legal, and/or other action(s) that we deem necessary and/or appropriate, with or without notice, to prevent violations and enforce the Agreement and remediate any purported violations. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right hereunder to an injunction without posting a bond to stop or prevent a breach or violation of your obligations under the Agreement.
    
    In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this User Agreement, and any other terms and/or conditions applicable to the Service, we shall determine which rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions shall control and prevail in our sole discretion, and you specifically waive any right to challenge or dispute such determination.
    
2. MONITORING AND COMPLAINTS AGAINST OTHER USERS
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    1. ### Monitoring
        
        We strive to provide an enjoyable online experience for our users, so we may monitor activity on the Service to foster compliance with the Agreement. You hereby specifically agree to such monitoring. Nevertheless, we do not make any representations, warranties, covenants or guarantees that: (1) the Service, or any portion thereof, will be monitored for accuracy or unacceptable use, (2) apparent statements of fact will be authenticated, or (3) we will take any specific action (or any action at all) in the event of a challenge or dispute regarding compliance or non-compliance with the Agreement. We generally do not pre-screen [Content](#content) before it is posted, uploaded, transmitted, sent or otherwise made available on or through the Service by users, so you may be exposed to Content that is opinionated, offensive, and/or inappropriate, including Content that violates the Agreement.
        
    2. ### What to Do if You Have a Complaint Against Another User
        
        1. Remember that by using the publicly accessible portions of the Service you may be exposed to Content that is opinionated, offensive, and/or inappropriate, including Content that may violate the Agreement. You should understand that not all of such Content is actionable. We ask that you not use the Service, or lodge complaints against other users, to facilitate a personal dispute. If you have a legitimate complaint about another user, please do the following:
            * Harassment: If you have reason to believe that another person is using the Service in a way that is harmful to you or others (e.g., to impersonate or imitate you, or to stalk, bully, threaten, intimidate or otherwise harass you or others), we urge you to contact your local authorities, or appropriate state or federal agencies.
            * Copyright Complaints: If you have reason to believe that your Content has been copied and/or is accessible on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that the Service contains links or other references to another site, application, destination or service that contains Content or activity that infringes your copyright rights, you may notify us as described below in the section entitled [Copyright Complaints](#content_4).
            * CyberCrime: If you have reason to believe you may be the victim of an online crime, such as identity theft, fraud, infringement, or hacking, you may contact the Internet Crime Complaint Center, at [www.ic3.gov](http://www.ic3.gov/), a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA).
        2. **IMPORTANT:** FALSE OR INACCURATE ACCUSATIONS THAT OTHERS HAVE COMMITED A CRIME, INAPPROPRIATE ACT, OR VIOLATION OF OUR AGREEMENT, COULD BE A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND/OR CIVIL LAW, OR OTHERWISE EXPOSE YOU TO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES).

Other [Personal Information](#personal) such as your age, gender, and preferences may also be requested. In addition, you may be asked to provide us similar information by telephone, postal mail, social media interaction or messaging (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or similar technologies). All such information shall be referred to in the Agreement as your “Registration Information”. We may use and share your Registration Information as described in [Privacy Policy](https://www.al.com/privacy-policy/).
        2. You agree, represent, warrant, covenant and guarantee that all Registration Information provided by you is true, accurate, complete, up-to-date, and solely yours. You may not impersonate, imitate or pretend to be somebody else when registering and/or setting up an account/profile on the Service. If any of your Registration Information changes, you are responsible for updating it promptly by using the mechanism or contact information on the Service that allows you to change or update your Registration Information, if available. If no such mechanism or contact information is available on the Service, please notify our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.al.com/privacy-policy/). WE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH OR ARISING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE, COMPLETE OR UP-TO-DATE REGISTRATION INFORMATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR FAILURE TO RECEIVE CRITICAL INFORMATION. WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION.
        3. We reserve the right at any time, with or without notice, to remove or require a change to or repossess any password and/or User ID that has been provided to you, any avatar you may be using or other Registration Information, or otherwise change the access means or methods for portions of the Service, the Service as a whole, or certain Products.
        4. You will be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Registration Information.

Any attempt to do so will be null and void and shall be considered a material breach of the Agreement.
        5. You are solely responsible for all access or visitation to, usage of, or activity on, your account/profile including, but not limited to, use of the account/profile by any person who uses your Registration Information, with or without authorization, or who has access to any [Device](#device) on which your account/profile resides or is accessible. You acknowledge and agree that we may, and you specifically authorize us to, process all transactions, including without limitation purchases and/or registration for Products that are initiated by use of your Registration Information.
        6. If you have reason to believe that your account/profile is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your Registration Information), you are responsible for promptly changing the affected Registration Information by using the mechanism or contact information on the Service, if available, and/or close the account/profile. If no such mechanism or contact information is available on the Service, please immediately notify our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.al.com/privacy-policy.html)

    4. ### Copyright Complaints
        
        1. We respect the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. We may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, in addition to our other remedies, terminate, discontinue, suspend and/or restrict the account/profile or ability to access, visit, and/or use the Service of users who infringe the copyright rights of others, and we may choose to remove, delete, erase, or disable access to Content deemed to be infringing.
        2. We may take the actions set forth in Section IV(D)(1) even for a single act of infringement. It is our policy to terminate the access of repeat infringers. If you are the subject of any of the aforementioned actions, you agree not to attempt to establish a new account/profile with the Service under any name, real or assumed, or otherwise attempt to access, visit, or use the Service. Please note that to the extent the Service or portions thereof do not limit usage to subscribers or account holders, we are not able to terminate, discontinue, suspend and/or restrict users who are neither subscribers nor account holders. Nothing herein shall limit our remedies in law or equity or by contract.
        3. If you have reason to believe that your Content has been copied and/or is accessible on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that the Service contains links or other references to another site, application, destination or service that contains Content or activity that infringes your copyright rights, you may notify us by providing a document via fax, first class U.S. mail, or e-mail that includes the following information (as required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. sec. 512) to our copyright agent set forth below:
            1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
            2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at the Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at the Service;
            3. Identification of the copyrighted work that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate such copyrighted work;

            5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted work in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

        4. **IMPORTANT:** MISREPRESENTATIONS MADE IN A NOTICE CLAIMING THAT CONTENT OR ACTIVITY IS INFRINGING VIOLATES THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT AND MAY EXPOSE YOU TO LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES). COURTS HAVE FOUND THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER COPYRIGHT DEFENSES, LIMITATIONS OR EXCEPTIONS BEFORE SENDING A NOTICE. ACCORDINGLY, IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHETHER CONTENT RESIDING ON OUR SERVICE INFRINGES YOUR COPYRIGHT, WE SUGGEST THAT YOU FIRST CONTACT AN ATTORNEY. IN ADDITION, PLEASE DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONTENT YOU ARE SENDING A NOTICE ABOUT IS ACTUALLY RESIDING ON OUR SERVICE BEFORE SENDING THE NOTICE.

    7. ### Arbitration, Waiver of Class Action Suits, and Dispute Resolution
        
        THIS SECTION SHOULD BE BROADLY CONSTRUED TO COVER ANY CLAIM RELATING TO ANY ASPECT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT.
        
        1. Informal Dispute Resolution. If you believe you have a Claim against us, you must provide a written description of the Claim, and make a good faith effort to resolve the Claim before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation arbitration or any court action. All Claim descriptions must be submitted via email to [disputenotice@advancelocal.com](mailto:disputenotice@advancelocal.com). If the Claim is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the Claim description is emailed to disputenotice@advancelocal.com, then the Dispute Resolution Procedure described below applies.
        2. The Informal Dispute Resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal Dispute Resolution proceeding. You and we agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be suspended while we engage in this Informal Dispute Resolution process.
        3. IN THE EVENT ANY CLAIM CANNOT BE INFORMALLY RESOLVED, YOU AND WE AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, RATHER THAN LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT, EXCEPT FOR THE CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM ARBITRATION LISTED BELOW IN PARAGRAPH 4. ARBITRATION MEANS YOU WILL HAVE A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT FOR THE CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM ARBITRATION LISTED BELOW IN PARAGRAPH 4.
            1. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, the Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer rules, and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM (collectively “NAM rules and procedures”). For more information about NAM and the arbitration process, please visit the NAM website at [www.namadr.com](https://www.namadr.com/) or email National Arbitration and Mediation's Commercial Dept at [commercial@namadr.com](mailto: commercial@namadr.com). If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.
            2. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by NAM's rules, except as follows: if your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to NAM.
            3. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of this arbitration provision will be decided by a court.
            4. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. The laws of the United States, State of New York, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws, applies to any arbitration under this section.
            5. Notwithstanding our agreement to resolve all Claims through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for Claims within the scope of such court's jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose.
            6. Arbitration Location and Form. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration, including any in-person hearings for the arbitration, shall take place either in your county of principal residence or in New York, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration, including any in-person hearings for the arbitration, shall be held in New York City, New York, unless you and we agree otherwise.
                
                If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your total Claims exceed $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.
                
            7. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party's identity, the claims being asserted, the factual allegations on which they are based, and proof that the claimant is a party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms of Use. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms of Use.
            8. Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 25 or more arbitration demands asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief are presented for filing by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) to NAM against Advance Local (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 25 demands per batch (if there are fewer than 25 arbitration demands left over after the initial batching, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the then-active batch of 25 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Advance Local and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 25 demands (or less as above), shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Advance Local and NAM to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other, NAM and the arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that NAM or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Advance Local otherwise consents in writing, Advance Local does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this subpart (viii). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain suspended until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.
                
                The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this subpart (viii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Advance Local shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.
                
            9. Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators. Advance Local and the remaining claimants' counsel may strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators, with the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Advance Local, the mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Advance Local or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Advance Local nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.
            10. The arbitrator's ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            11. As indicated above in [Section VIII(C)(3)](#legal_2_3), this Agreement to Arbitrate shall survive any termination of the Agreement, including any termination of your relationship with us.
        4. RESTRICTIONS ON CLAIMS:
            1. AN ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM, OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS BARRED AND THE RIGHT TO PURSUE SUCH CLAIM IS WAIVED.
            2. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING A CLASS ACTION IN COURT OR A CLASS ARBITRATION. ALL PARTIES MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY NAMED. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED IN COURT ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS ON BEHALF OF OTHER USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, REGISTRANTS OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED, OR BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL).
            3. AS STATED MORE FULLY IN [Section VIII(B)(3)](#legal_2_3) ABOVE, ALL PARTIES WAIVE ANY CLAIM TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR MULTIPLIED DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY CLAIM WITH US.
        5. WE AND YOU AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION (“EXCLUDED CLAIMS”): (1) ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR US IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE THE AMOUNT IN CONTROVERSY IS PROPERLY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT; (2) ANY CLAIM REGARDING ANY PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, (3) ANY ACTION SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, INJUNCTION, OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION REGARDING WHETHER A PARTY'S CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED OR MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
        6. You further agree that for Excluded Claims and other Claims in which arbitration is denied:
            1. the restrictions set forth in [Section VIII(G)(3)(ii)-(iii)](#arbitration_3) above shall apply; and
            2. regardless of where you access, visit and/or use the Products and Services, such Claims shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, State of New York, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws; and
            3. will be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York, New York, and you specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any claim of forum non-conveniens. Should there be a conflict between the laws of New York, and any other laws, the conflict will be resolved in favor of New York law.
        7. With the exception of this subpart (7) and subpart(3)(vii) above, if for any reason an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Agreement, or portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision or portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable in full force and effect. If, however, this subpart (7) or subpart (3)(viii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Advance Local shall be entitled to arbitrate their Claim.
        8. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING BY CONTACTING US AT
