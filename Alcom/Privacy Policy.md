5. Tracking Techniques and Technologies and Targeted Advertising
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Tracking Techniques and Technologies  
    We and our third-party business partners use various tools and technologies such as cookies, pixels, localStorage, web beacons, software development kits, and similar technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).
    
    Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.
    
    The use of these Tracking Technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, track trends, measure the effectiveness of ads, conduct frequency capping, and tailor offers about our Products and Services to you. We also allow specific, approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics including how to opt out, visit [How Google Uses Information](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-US) and to [Opt-out of Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    
    We and our third-party business partners may also use these Tracking Technologies to gather Personal Information, including Sensitive Personal Information, about how you view and use our Products and Services and to connect your activity with other data we maintain about you.
    
    Targeted Advertising and Identity Resolution Partners  
    We and our third-party business partners may collect and share Personal Information about your online and offline activities over time and across unaffiliated websites and mobile applications to predict your preferences and interests, and, in conjunction with third parties, may use your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising and to serve advertising believed to be of interest to you ("Targeted Advertising").
    
    We may collaborate with our service providers and our third-party Identity Resolution Partners to deliver Targeted Advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Products and Services. We and these Identity Resolution Partners facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity and Device Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser.
    
    For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, who may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers may also help us with fraud detection and security, to enforce our User Agreement, verify user authentication for accessing Content behind a paywall, and to determine eligibility for offers available exclusively to new subscribers, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can Opt-Out of Identity Resolution Partner LiveRamp’s use of your Personal Information for these purposes by visiting [https://optout.liveramp.com/opt\_out](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out), or, as described in the [Opting Out of a “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information or of its Use for Targeted Advertising](#sale_opt_out) section below.
    
    As noted in the Social Media Company Integration section above, we may utilize Tracking Technologies to disclose information about your use of our Products and Services to social media companies and other third-party business partners to serve you and other segments of users Targeted Advertising and to facilitate marketing communications.
    
    We and our advertising partners may make inferences about your interests and these inferences may be used for Targeted Advertising. In certain U.S. states, these inferences may be considered Sensitive Personal Information. When we obtain this information from our third-party business partners, we will, where required by law, contractually ensure that they have obtained your consent or offered you an opportunity to opt out before sharing it with us. Similarly, if we collect Sensitive Personal Information directly from you, where required by law, we will obtain your consent, provide you an opportunity to opt out, or take other appropriate action. For more information about your rights regarding Sensitive Personal Information under local laws, please refer to the [Exercising Your Privacy Rights, Including the Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising](#optout_top) section below.

These providers may use Tracking Technologies to deliver advertisements to you when you visit third-party websites within their networks.

            * If you accessed the “Your Privacy Choices” button/link from the website or mobile application of an Advance Local market (e.g., NJ.com), when you make your Opt-Out choice following the process described above, the Opt-Out will only be applied on the specific market's website. If you want to Opt-Out on our other websites, you will need to go to that website, access the “Your Privacy Choices” button/link and follow the Opt-Out process described above.
    * We also recognize Global Privacy Control as a valid opt-out method. Certain browsers and browser extensions support [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) which sends a signal to websites indicating your choice to Opt-out of the use of your Personal Information for Targeted Advertising and “sales” or “shares” as defined under applicable law. We honor the GPC and where required by law, similar user-initiated browser based opt-out preference signals. Note that the Global Privacy Control is currently only applicable to opt-outs from websites. For mobile apps, please follow the instructions above.
    * To Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising enabled by other uses of your Personal Information, such as by LiveRamp, an Identity Resolution partner, visit [https://optout.liveramp.com/opt\_out](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out).
    * To Opt-out of “sales” or “sharing” such as if your name and mailing address is used in connection with list rental and data co-ops, fill out this [form](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/57316691-7a35-4427-b868-f6c059de9bc0/49b8f00f-7426-4ae6-9561-6efd1d14ba34) or call 1-888-914-9661 and use PIN 981105.
    * Do Not Track (DNT). Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. Since there is no consensus about what DNT means in this context and how to implement DNT signals, like many other businesses, our websites do not respond to these DNT signals, but you have the options noted above and below to make choices about how your Personal Information is used.

For example, we may seek to establish your identity to a reasonable or a reasonably high degree of certainty by matching information that you submit alongside your request with information that we have in our records.

Authorized agents may also be required to provide a copy of the consumer's signed permission authorizing the agent to submit requests on the consumer's behalf under applicable local law.

    Financial Incentive  
    By providing us your Personal Information, such as your email address, to register or otherwise create an account on our websites or mobile apps we may give you access to Content that would otherwise require a paid subscription (“Program”). California and other states may consider this Program to be a financial incentive or loyalty program. Personal Information you provide to us as part of this Program may be used for Targeted Advertising and disclosed to our Identity Resolution Partners, as described in this Privacy Policy. You retain all rights that you otherwise have, including to Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising, and to make requests about your Personal Information, and any such requests will not affect your access to or participation in the Program, including if you leave the Program. You may withdraw from the Program at any time by logging into your account or emailing our Privacy Policy Coordinator at [Privacy\_inquiry@advance.com](mailto: privacy_inquiry@advancelocal.com).
    
    The value of the Personal Information you provided is reasonably related to the benefits you get from the Program and includes the value of your access to our Content; our costs to provide you with the Content and to collect and process your Personal Information; and the potential benefits, such as additional advertising revenue and improvements we can make to our Products and Services through the Program.
    
    California Online Erasure  
    California's "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code §§ 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Products and Services that is directed to California residents at least 13 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the content by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email or as described below. In response to your request, we may elect to make the content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the content.
    
9. Opting Out of Marketing Communications
    --------------------------------------
    
    If you do not wish to receive future marketing or other commercial messages from us, follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the message you receive.

14. International Transfers
