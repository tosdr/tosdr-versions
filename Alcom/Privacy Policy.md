We may also use your information to gather broad demographic information, to analyze trends, to seek compatible advertisers, sponsors, clients and customers, and to track users' movements around the Service and elsewhere on the internet or across apps or devices (including for "OBA" as described below). Your general geolocation data may specifically be used to show you content (including advertising and sponsored messaging) based on your general geographic location. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your prior consent before using your personal information for marketing and promotional purposes.

We may also deidentify or anonymize your data in such a way that you may not reasonably be re-identified by us or another party, and we may use this deidentified data for any purpose permitted under applicable law. To the extent we deidentify any data originally based on personal information, we will maintain and use such data in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the data.

4. Our Use of Cookies and Related Technologies
    -------------------------------------------
    
    Cookies/Local Device Storage. The Service will at times place and/or store code or other types of information and/or software on your device or within your browser, such as cookies, locally shared objects, and HTML5 (collectively, "Local Device Storage"). We and third party business partners may independently or in conjunction use Local Device Storage in connection with the Service in a way that collects personal information for the purposes described in the respective privacy policies, including without limitation to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before on the same or different device and to otherwise control and tailor the display of ads to you based on your perceived preferences by collecting data to track the movements of individual users through the Service and elsewhere on the internet over time and across unaffiliated websites, apps, and devices, as well as to help diagnose problems with servers, to gather broad demographic information, to conduct research, to deliver editorial content, to record registration and personalization information, to inform offers that we may make to you, and to otherwise administer the Service. For example, if you register on any part of the Service and are given the option to save your username and password, we may provide this convenience to you via Local Device Storage.
    
    * You May Disable Local Device Storage. If you do not want Local Device Storage, your device, browser, or the settings menu within an application may include an option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the Service may not function properly.
    * Tracking Technologies. In addition to Local Device Storage, we and/or our third party business partners may use web beacons, web bugs, internet or pixel tags, clear gifs, digital fingerprinting (aka "Machine Identification") and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the "Tracking Technologies") on the Service, including in our communications with you, such as within e-mail and text messages, in-application push notifications, videos, and throughout your use of the Services. We and our third party business partners use Tracking Technologies to determine which messages have been opened by recipients, and for all or some of the same lawful purposes described above for use of Local Device Storage. For additional information see the Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) section below.
    * Do Not Track (DNT). Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus as to what DNT means in this context, and since some browsers apply DNT signals by default it does not necessarily reflect our visitors' choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites, we do not alter our practices when the Service receives a DNT signal from a visitor's browser. As discussed below, you may opt out of the use of your personal information for online behavioral advertising by third parties at any time. To find out more about DNT, please visit [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com/).
    * Global Privacy Control (GPC) and similar privacy preference signals. Where required by applicable local law, and as further described in the [Your Privacy Choices and Rights; Submitting Requests Under Applicable Local Laws](#rights_top) section below, we honor user-initiated browser based opt-out preference signals recognized under applicable local law, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). To find out more about GPC, please visit [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).
5. Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) and How to Opt-Out Of OBA
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    * How OBA Works. We and our third party business partners, use Tracking Technologies on the Service for purposes of "online behavioral advertising" (OBA). OBA allows the serving of advertisements tailored to perceived interests inferred by your browsing on the Service and on other sites, applications, destinations, and services, over time and across unaffiliated websites, apps, and services, using the same or a different device. To enable OBA, we and our third party business partners, independently use Tracking Technologies to collect certain information, some of which may be deemed personal information, including for example the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier, online identifier) and geographic location of your device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. Your email address may also be used by us, in coordination with third party audience authentication service providers to enable OBA.
    * Opt-Out of OBA. If you do not want OBA, you may be able to opt-out by visiting [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/), [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/), [www.youronlinechoices.com](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/), and/or by clicking the "Ad Choices" icon that appears in advertising served through OBA. Please note that these opt-out options only apply to tracking by third party business partners using cookie-based OBA across this Service and other sites, applications, destinations, and services, and not tracking among pages within the Service itself. As may be required under applicable law, to opt-out of OBA enabled by use of your email address in coordination with audience authentication providers, visit [https://optout.liveramp.com/opt\_out](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out), or see the [Your Privacy Choices and Rights; Submitting Requests Under Applicable Local Laws](#rights_top) section below.

    **_California Online Erasure._** California's "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code §§ 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of content they post. If you fit that description and posted content on a section of our Service that is directed to California residents at least 13 and younger than 18 years of age, you may request removal of the content by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by [email](mailto:Privacy_inquiry@advance.net) or as described at the end of this document. In response to your request, we may elect to make the content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which case the content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the content.
    
7. Opt-Out of Marketing Communications
    -----------------------------------
    
    If you do not wish to receive future marketing or other commercial messages from us, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the message you receive.

    --------------------------
    
    We implement physical, technical, and organizational security measures designed to safeguard personal information.

    ------------------------------------------------
    
    Please be aware that content and personal information that you disclose in publicly accessible portions of the Service may be available to other users, and may also be made available outside the Service by third parties, so you should be mindful of all personal information, especially sensitive personal information, that you may wish to post. To the extent required by applicable local law, we may require that you obtain the consent of any individual whose personal information you post on our Services.
    
11. International Transfers
    -----------------------
