============

_Last modified: September 16, 2023_

Acceptance of the Terms of Use
------------------------------

These terms of use are entered into by and between You and Rinth, Inc. (**"Company"**, **"we"** or **"us"**). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "Terms of Use"), govern your access to and use of www.modrinth.com, api.modrinth.com, or the Modrinth App, including any content, functionality and services offered on or through www.modrinth.com, api.modrinth.com, or the Modrinth App (the "Service"), whether as a guest or a registered user.

Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, our Copyright Policy, and our California Privacy Notice. If you do not want to agree to these terms and policies, you must not access or use the Service.

The Service is offered and available to users who are 13 years of age or older. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Service.

Changes to the Terms of Use
---------------------------

We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Service thereafter.

Your continued use of the Service following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page each time you access the Service so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

Accessing the Service and Account Security
------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Service, and any service or material we provide through the Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.

You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Service, and ensuring that all persons who access the Service through your internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

To access the Service or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Service that all the information you provide on the Service is correct, current and complete. You agree that all information you provide to register with the Service or otherwise, including but not limited to through the use of any interactive features on the Service, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

If you choose, or are provided with, a email, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to the Service or portions of it using your user name, password or other security information (and if you do, you agree to be responsible for and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from any damages caused by any such person to whom you provide any such information). You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.

We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms of Use.

About the Service
-----------------

The Service allows you to upload and share your gaming content (the "Gaming Content", to be distinguished from User Contributions, defined below) with other users of our Service. Unlike User Contributions, which are owned by the Company, when you use the Service and upload and share your Gaming Content, the Company does not claim any right, title or interest in or to your Gaming Content. At the same time, the Company disclaims any and all liability in connection with the Gaming Content, and you are solely responsible for any and all claims, actions, damages and the like in connection with the Gaming Content.

When you upload your Gaming Content, you hereby grant us a limited use, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, right to display and distribute your Gaming Content to our users through the Service, which our users in turn may then use at their sole discretion.

When you delete your Gaming Content, you agree that your Gaming Content may continue to be used by any users who have previously downloaded your Gaming Content pursuant to the preceding license, and you also agree that your Gaming Content may continue to be part of any already-existing Gaming Content "packs" created by other users as part of our Service until such time as such Gaming Content has been deleted by such user(s) as part of such "pack(s)". Otherwise, for the avoidance of doubt, as between the Company and you, you own and will continue to own all right, title and interest in and to your Gaming Content.

All Gaming Content must abide by the [Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules).

API Usage
---------

As part of our Services, we provide a tool known as Application Programming Interfaces (Modrinth API). The Modrinth API enables users to perform actions on the Service via their own services, such as their websites and/or applications.

We grant the User of the Modrinth API a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and revocable license to download, display, query, create, edit, and delete the User Generated Content on the Service via their own services, such as their websites and/or applications (the API License), provided the User complies with the following conditions:

* The User uses the Modrinth API in accordance with these Terms, the Community Standards and all applicable laws and regulations that apply to such use.
* the User does not infringe any rights of third parties.
* the User provides Modrinth all assistance requested in complying with, and concluding all agreements required by the applicable laws and regulations.

Each User using the Modrinth API shall indemnify Modrinth and keep Modrinth indemnified for all claims, proceedings or actions brought by another User or any other third party, including governmental authorities.

Our Rewards Program
-------------------

Our rewards program (**"Rewards Program"**) provides developers and content creators with an opportunity to monetize the projects that they upload to the Service.

The Company pays to you a percentage of net revenue collected by us and attributable to ad impressions displayed solely on your project pages. The funds are directly deposited into your account, which you can monitor and access via your creator dashboard. Simply enroll in the Rewards Program on your dashboard in order to be able to take advantage of this program. Please review the [Rewards Program Terms](https://modrinth.com/legal/cmp), as it contains very important language regarding, among other things, your status as an independent contractor, your responsibility to pay taxes, our disclaimers and limitations of liability (in addition to our disclaimers and limitations of liability in these Terms of Use).

----------------------------

Except for the Gaming Content, the Service and its entire contents, features and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof), are owned by the Company, its licensors or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.
