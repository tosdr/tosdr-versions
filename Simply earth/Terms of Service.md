As a subscribed Simply Earth member, each month we will ship you a package with a different selection of items that may consist of a selection from oils, powders, waxes, stickers, containers, or other natural-home-related items (“Products”). Each month of your subscription, the selection of Products may change.

BY SUBSCRIBING YOU AGREE TO PAY THE MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPPLIED EACH MONTH.

Products

Certain products or services may be available exclusively online through the website. We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of our products that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any color will be accurate.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or Services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at anytime without notice, at the sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any product or service made on this site is void where prohibited.

We do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Service will be corrected.

Billing and Payments

Prices for our products are subject to change without notice. We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

The price of the Services and/or goods is payable in full before delivery. We accept the following credit cards at this time: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover. You will automatically be charged each month for your ongoing subscription. Unless you cancel your subscription or membership prior to the end of your then-current subscription period, at the end of that period, your subscription will automatically be renewed for an additional subscription period of the same amount of time.

We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.

For your convenience and continuous subscription benefits as a member, if your payment method reaches its expiration date, you do not edit your credit card information, and you have an ongoing subscription, you authorize us to continue billing that credit card on file including extending the expiration date until we are notified by you or the credit card company that the account is no longer valid. We encourage you to constantly update your payment method information or cancel your membership should you wish to discontinue your monthly purchase of Products.

We use a third party payment service in lieu of directly processing your credit card information. By submitting your credit card information, you grant Simply Earth the right to store and process your information with the third party payment service, which it may change from time to time; you agree that Simply Earth will not be responsible for any failures of the third party to adequately protect such information. All financial matters regarding your information are subject to the conditions of the third party payment service provider's terms of service; the current version of which is attached as a link at https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal.
