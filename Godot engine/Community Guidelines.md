Code of Conduct

[Contact](https://godotengine.org/contact/) [Code of Conduct](https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct/) [Privacy](https://godotengine.org/privacy-policy/) [Governance](https://godotengine.org/governance/) [Teams](https://godotengine.org/teams/) [License](https://godotengine.org/license/)

The Godot project is an international community open to everyone without discrimination. We want this community to be a safe and welcoming place for both newcomers and current members. Everyone should feel comfortable and accepted regardless of their personal background and affiliation to the Godot project.

### Philosophy

In the Godot community, participants from all over the world come together to create a Free and Open Source game engine. This is made possible by the support, hard work, and enthusiasm of thousands of people who collaborate towards the common goal of creating great technology and games. Cooperation at such a scale requires common guidelines to ensure a positive and inspiring atmosphere in the community.

This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type of community we want to have. The rules below are not applied to all interactions with a simple matching algorithm. Human interactions happen in context and are complex. Perceived violations are evaluated by real humans who will try to interpret the interactions and the rules with kindness. Accordingly, there is no need to hypothesize on how these rules would affect normal interactions. Be reasonable, the [Code of Conduct team](#coc-team) surely will be as well.

### Application

This Code of Conduct applies to all users and contributors who engage with the Godot project and its community platforms, both online and at Godot-related events.

### Expectations

* Politeness is expected at all times. Be kind and courteous.
* Always assume positive intent from others. Be aware that differences in culture and English proficiency make written communication more difficult than face-to-face communication and that your interpretation of messages may not be the one the author intended. Conversely, if someone asks you to rephrase something you said, be ready to do so without feeling judged.
* Feedback is always welcome but keep your criticism constructive. We encourage you to open discussions, proposals, issues, and bug reports. Use the community platforms to discuss improvements, not to vent out frustration. Similarly, when other users offer you feedback please accept it gracefully.

### Restricted conduct

Participating in restricted conduct will lead to a warning from community moderators and/or the Code of Conduct team and may lead to exclusion from the community in the form of a ban from one or all platforms.

* The Godot project is committed to providing a friendly and safe environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, language proficiency, age, political orientation, nationality, religion, or other similar characteristics. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of participants in any form.
* In particular, we strive to be welcoming to all industry minorities and to ensure that they can take a more active role in the community and the project. Targeted harassment of minorities is unacceptable.
* As a community developed project, we strive for consensus among contributors before moving forward with a proposed feature. If there is not enough support for your ideas, please don't continue insisting or trying to force others into supporting your point. Features are not accepted through a voting process, so piling onto a contentious feature proposal is not acceptable.
* Aggressive or offensive behavior is not acceptable.
* You will be excluded from participating in the community if you insult, demean, harass, intentionally make others uncomfortable by any means, or participate in any other hateful conduct, either publicly or privately.
* Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome and will result in exclusion from the community.
* Any form of retaliation against a participant who contacts the Code of Conduct team is completely unacceptable, regardless of the outcome of the complaint. Any such behavior will result in exclusion from the community.
* For certainty, any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is not acceptable.

### Reporting a breach

If you witness or are involved in an interaction with another community member that you think may violate this Code of Conduct, please contact Godot's [\[email protected\]](https://godotengine.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

The Godot team recognizes that it can be difficult to come forward in cases of a violation of the Code of Conduct. To make it easier to report violations, we provide a single point of contact via email at: [\[email protected\]](https://godotengine.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you are more comfortable reaching out to a single person, you are also welcome to contact one or more members of the team using their personal emails [listed below](#coc-team), or via direct messaging on community platforms where they are present.
