Cookies Policy
==============

LAST UPDATED 12 SEPTEMBER 2024 Open all

1\. What are cookies?

Cookies are harmless text files that allow a website server to recognise you when you revisit the website. There are two main types of cookies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Transient (or session) cookies. | These are set and exist for the duration of your visit to a specific website and are removed when you finish. They recognise you as you move, and navigate between, the different website pages so that you do not need to re-enter who you are and often can help to maintain your security. |
| Persistent (or permanent) cookies. | These remain on your computer until they expire or are deleted. Many persistent cookies have automatic deletion dates to help ensure your computer doesn't get overloaded with cookies. Persistent cookies will often retain previously entered information to ease and simplify subsequent data input. For example: your login user ID or email address. |

Like most websites, this website uses both types of cookies to simplify and ease a user's journey and experience. Cookies can also be 1st (first) or 3rd (third) party cookies:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1st Party : | These are owned and created by us for the website you're viewing. |
| 3rd Party : | These are owned and created by an independent company. Usually this is a company partnering to provide services to us as owners of the website. |

We use both our own (first-party) and partner companies' (third-party) cookies to facilitate and support a simpler and more secure website experience for our users

4\. Cookies categorised as intrusive

Cookies can be categorised as being 'intrusive' or not in relation to storing any data items that could potentially identify some aspect of an individual user's identity; whether real or a pseudonym.

Whilst in legal interpretations there are degrees of intrusiveness, TES Global has adopted the more cautious definition where any cookie that has a single identifying data item is categorised as 'intrusive'. All intrusive cookies, whether session or persistent, are stored in encrypted form to protect against any possibility of accidental or unintended disclosure.
