3.1.2. “**Personal Data**”, “**Data Controller**” and “**Data Processor**” and “**processing**” shall have the meanings given to them in the DPA or, from 25 May 2018, the GDPR.  
3.2. This Policy applies to the Personal Data that we collect from you when you submit information to us via the Website or during the registration process. This policy does not apply to the information that the System stores or holds about any school staff, pupils or parents which is stored in accordance with our terms and conditions, which can be found at [https://www.edukey.co.uk/edukey-terms-conditions/](https://www.edukey.co.uk/edukey-terms-conditions/) and our Information Sharing agreement with the relevant school.  
3.3. For the purposes of applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements, we are a Data Controller and therefore we are responsible for, and control the processing of, your Personal Data in accordance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements. “Personal Data” has a legal definition but, in brief, it refers to information from which a living person can be identified. Such information must be protected in accordance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements.

4.1. When you use the Website, register for our applications or when you otherwise deal with us we may collect the following information about you (“**Information**”):

4.3. Occasionally we may receive information about you from other sources, for example from any third party websites and applications that integrate or communicate with the Website in relation to you.

If you have given permission, we may share your personal data with carefully selected third party organisations and business partners and they may contact you directly (unless you have asked them not to do so) by \[mail, telephone and email\] about products, services, promotions and special offers that may be of interest to you. We will inform you (before collecting your data) and seek your permission if we intend to disclose your data to third parties for such purposes.

13.2. Such countries may not have similar protections in place regarding protection and use of your data as those set out in this Policy.

If you give us information on behalf of a third party, you confirm that the third party has appointed you to act on his/her/their behalf and has agreed that you can: give consent on his/her/their behalf to the processing of his/her/their Information; receive on his/her/their behalf any data protection notices; and give consent to the transfer of his/her/their Information abroad (if applicable).  
**15\. Your rights**  
If you are an individual, this section sets out your legal rights in respect of any of your Personal Data that we are holding and/or processing.

15.1. You have the right (which may be subject to the payment of a small fee depending on when you request this right) to request information about Personal Data that we may hold and/or process about you, including: whether or not we are holding and/or processing your Personal Data; the extent of the Personal Data we are holding; and the purposes and extent of the processing.  
15.2. You have the right to have any inaccurate information we hold about you be corrected and/or updated. If any of the Information that you have provided changes, or if you become aware of any inaccuracies in such Information, please let us know in writing giving us enough information deal with the change or correction.  
15.3. You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we delete all Personal Data we hold about you (the ‘right of erasure’). Please note that this right of erasure is not available in all circumstances, for example where we need to retain the Personal Data for legal compliance purposes. If this is the case we will let you know.  
15.4. You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data, for example where the Personal Data is inaccurate or where you have objected to the processing (see clause 15.6 below).

15.7. You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, for example where a computer algorithm (rather than a person) makes decisions which affect your contractual rights. Please note that this right is not available in all circumstances. If you request this right and it is not available to you we will let you know.  
15.8. You have the right to object to direct marketing, for which see clause 9.4 above.
