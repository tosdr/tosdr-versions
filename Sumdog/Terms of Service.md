Sumdog Terms of Use
===================

Updated 5th June 2024

Whenever you use Sumdog, you must make sure that you understand and accept these terms of use. If you don’t understand them, please ask someone – for example, a parent or teacher – to help you with them.  
  
If you are a student, you need permission from a parent, a guardian or (when at school) a teacher before you use Sumdog. Also, your parent, guardian or teacher will need to register on your behalf. There may be additional restrictions, which vary from country to country, below certain age limits.  
  
If you’re a parent or a teacher registering for a child to use Sumdog, you are also responsible for making sure your children don’t break these terms.

If you are a member of, or wish to join, a Sumdog School that doesn’t meet any of these conditions, you should contact us.

If you have a Sumdog teacher account, and cease to be a member of staff at the Sumdog School you have joined, you must leave that account. If this is prevented by the site (for example, if you’re the last teacher remaining on the account) you should contact us.

### Sumdog subscriptions

The benefits of each Sumdog subscription will be published on Sumdog. We may change the price or benefits for any Sumdog Subscription at our discretion.

In order to access and use Sumdog, all Users must have a valid subscription or trial. If a subscription or trial period ends and the User has not purchased a new subscription, the User’s access will be terminated and the User will not have access until a new subscription is purchased. 

When purchasing any Sumdog Subscription, you accept that

* fees for Sumdog Subscriptions are billed in advance;
* if any fees are not paid when they are due, we may terminate or suspend your Sumdog Subscription immediately;
* Sumdog Subscriptions are not transferable – and may not be resold – either partly or in their entirety;
* any discount codes are not transferable, and may only be used once, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing; and
* unless we’ve agreed differently in writing, Sumdog Subscriptions are non-refundable, except as provided for by applicable law. If your subscription is cancelled before the end of the period you purchased, you will not be given any refund;
* any part of your Sumdog Subscription that has been provided for you as a result of someone else’s agreement with us, for example as a donation, is dependent on that person keeping to the terms of that agreement.

And you confirm that

* Any payment methods, such as credit or debit cards, that you provide to us are yours, or that you have the authority to provide them.

For Sumdog Starter subscriptions only:

* Sumdog Starter is a short term product only available until August 2024
* Sumdog Starter is intended **only** for schools which had previously used the free Sumdog product
* Schools who have at any point after March 2023 held a Premium subscription are not eligible to purchase Sumdog Starter unless specifically agreed otherwise by a Sumdog employee

### Delivery

Sumdog Subscriptions are all delivered online, so you won’t receive anything physical.

We will let you use the services your Sumdog Subscription covers as soon as we accept your order.

### Sumdog subscriptions for schools

When ordering a Sumdog Subscription on behalf of an Educational Institution, you confirm that

* you are a member of staff at that Educational Institution;
* you have the authority to place the order on behalf of that Educational Institution.

**Renewal of Sumdog Subscriptions**

* Each Term shall automatically renew for subsequent period of the same length as the initial Term unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least (30) days prior to expiration of the current term
* For multi-school subscriptions, we will be in touch with the Educational Institution’s representative throughout the subscription, and will discuss the renewal with them directly
* For individual schools, grades, or classes, and if conversation (either written or oral) is not already ongoing about the renewal, at least 60 days before the end of the current subscription period we will send the Educational Institution’s representative an e-mail with the price for the service for the new subscription period and the date that the invoice will be sent (the Invoice Date)
* If the Educational Institution requires a Purchase Order to pay the invoice, this should be provided for adding to the invoice at least 3 working days before the Invoice Date specified
* On the Invoice Date, we will send the Educational Institution’s representative an invoice for the next subscription period
* The service will terminate at the end of the current subscription period if the invoice has not been paid, or we have not received confirmation that the Educational Institution intends to pay the invoice
* If, despite receipt of confirmation that the Educational Institution wishes to renew its Sumdog Subscription, our invoice has not been paid when due, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate the service at any time  
      
    

**Acceptable use**

When you purchase a Class Subscription, it is intended for use with one specified standard-sized class of students.

When you purchase for a whole grade or a whole school, we’ll ask you how many students you need to cover with your subscription.

We won’t be concerned if, during your subscription, you need to add a few more students than you anticipated when purchasing. However, you may not let your subscription cover considerably more students than was intended. If we find that this is happening, we may take action, including terminating your subscription, or invoicing your educational establishment to cover your additional usage for the full duration of the subscription. Examples of unacceptable use include repeatedly transferring a class subscription between different classes or students, or allowing many more students than were originally requested to be covered by a school or grade/year subscription.

We may check that your use of your Sumdog Subscription is compatible with the information you gave us, or the product you chose, when purchasing.

### Sumdog subscriptions for parents and guardians

Parents or guardians can purchase personal subscriptions for children in their family. When purchasing such a subscription, you accept that

* each Sumdog subscription applies either to only one child; or to a family, containing up to two parents or guardians and three children
* we will charge the initial subscription fee, including any applicable taxes, to your chosen payment method as soon as you agree the purchase;
* we will only accept your order once full payment of this initial fee has been received;
* after you agree a purchase, we will continue to bill ongoing fees and any other charges incurred on that subscription to your chosen payment method, unless the subscription is cancelled;
* only direct relatives of that child (parents or guardians) can be connected to the child’s account;
* each subscription is not transferable. Whereby the subscription applies to a child, the subscription is personal to one child. Whereby the subscription applies to a family, the subscription is personal to the family
* where a child’s Sumdog login is also connected to his or her school account, some features may be disabled during school hours, at the discretion of the school.

### Third parties and external links

Sumdog may carry links to websites which aren’t under our control. We are not responsible for these websites, or their content, or any offers they make to you.

Any dealings you have with them are completely independent of us, and we cannot be held responsible if you suffer damage or loss as a result.

### Changes to these terms

We may modify these terms from time to time, in which case we will notify you by posting the new version on the Sumdog website.

It’s your responsibility to be aware of the current terms. Any changes apply as soon as they are posted, and if you use Sumdog after that, you show that you accept the updated terms.

### Other terms

Unless otherwise agreed, we make no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, in relation to Sumdog.

We will not be liable for any loss occurring as a result of using Sumdog. If you wish to make any claim against another user arising from their use of Sumdog, you will pursue it only against them, independently of us.

You agree that you fully indemnify us against all claims, liability, losses, costs and expenses – including legal fees – suffered by us which arise from a breach of this agreement by you, or from your use of Sumdog, or from use of Sumdog by any other person who accesses Sumdog using your Login Details, computer or internet account, as permitted by law. Furthermore, you agree that you are fully responsible for such claims, losses, costs and expenses or liabilities, as permitted by law.

Nothing in these terms limits your rights as a consumer under law, or limits our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or that of our employees or agents.
