    ------------------
    
    Starting to use the service is quick and practical. The registration is free, and the terms of service are very simple:
    
    * You will not share your unique ID nor sell it to anyone, under any circumstances.
    * You represent and warrant that your use of 2Captcha will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
    * You agree that this is a paid system, and will not try to circumvent payments by no means.
    * You agree that you won't modify, copy or recreate parts of any of our API clients without the explicit consent of 2Captcha.
    * You agree to use 2Captcha Service exclusively for authorized and legal purposes, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.
    
    Please note that your account may be suspended or terminated in case of violation of those simple rules.
    
2. Definitions
    -----------
    
    2Captcha ("2Captcha” or the "Service”) is a manual CAPTCHA solving service provided through the URL 2captcha.com (the "Website”) which allows you to recognize CAPTCHAs images. 2Captcha is owned and operated by ALTWEB L.L.C-FZ, a Dubai Emirate Co. ("2Captcha”, "we”, "us”). 2Captcha has employees, independent contractors, and representatives ("our Team"). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you're a "Member” according to this agreement (it’s "you”). These Terms of Use ("Terms,” along with our our API Guidelines) define the terms and conditions under which you’re allowed to use 2Captcha and how we’ll treat your account while you’re a Member. If you have any questions about our terms, feel free to contact us at support@2captcha.com.
    
3. Eligibility

    * agree to the Terms;
    * and provide true, complete, and up to date contact information.
    
    By using 2Captcha, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won’t use 2Captcha in a way that violates any laws or regulations. 2Captcha may refuse service, close accounts of any users, and change eligibility requirements at any time.

4. Term
    ----
    
    The Term begins when you sign up for 2Captcha and continues as long as you use the Service. Clicking the button and entering your username means that you’ve officially "signed” the Terms. If you sign up for 2Captcha on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.
    
5. Closing Your Account
    --------------------
    
    You or 2Captcha may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving Notice to the other party. We may suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. We won’t refund or reimburse you if there’s cause, like a violation of these Terms. Once terminated, we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with it. If you don’t log in to your account for 12 or more months, we may treat your account as "inactive" and permanently delete the account and all the data associated with it.
