**How we collect your personal data**

Data you send to us

You may provide us with your information by filling in forms or by corresponding with us. This includes personal data you provide when you:

* Apply for our products or services
* Create an account or register as a referral and reseller customer
* Subscribe to our newsletter or other similar services
* Request marketing communications or materials
* Apply for a job
* Enter a contest or respond to a survey, or otherwise provide feedback

Data we collect automatically

We automatically collect information during your visit to our websites, newsletters, discussion forums and lists and opt-in announcement lists (the "BeyondTrust Network"). We do this via our automatic data collection tools ("Data Collection Tools"), such as cookies, web beacons, embedded web links, and other commonly used tracking technologies.

These Data Collection Tools collect technical and usage data that your browser sends to our websites such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at the BeyondTrust Network. These Data Collection Tools may also collect information about your IP address, clickstream behavior and product information. When a visitor requests a page from any website within the BeyondTrust Network, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address.

We collect and use your IP address and cookie information to better understand your needs and interests to help deliver a consistent and personalized experience on the BeyondTrust Network. We will only use your IP address to the extent necessary to protect our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party (this may include pursuing legal claims and investigating criminal offences).

You can adjust your cookie preferences [here](https://www.beyondtrust.com/forms/manage-cookies?_gl=1*1fzllqt*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTYwMTI4NDQzOS4xNjY0MzU2ODYw*_ga_5W4QD38R5C*MTY2NDM1OTUxNi4yLjAuMTY2NDM1OTUxNi4wLjAuMA..).

Third parties and publicly available information

We also collect information from credible, third party, and commercially-available sources. The information we collect from these sources may include your name, phone number, business address, email address, firmographic data which may be used along with the information we collect when you visit the BeyondTrust Network. We also use Google Analytics, which is a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track pseudonymized information about our visitors to our website in an aggregated format to capture usage and volume statistics which are then shared with us.

**Aggregated data**

We also collect, use, and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for different purposes. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data according to applicable law, as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity, and instead relates to a number of individuals. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

**Special categories of personal data**

**What are special categories of personal data?**

Special categories of personal data are also called sensitive data. They are personal data that deserve a stronger protection because of their sensitive nature. For example, the following are sensitive personal data:

* race and ethnic origin
* religious or philosophical beliefs
* sex life and sexual orientation
* political opinions
* trade union membership
* health information
* genetic and biometric data

We do not generally collect any special categories of personal data about you. We also do not collect any information about criminal convictions and offences, except for background checks we perform on job applicants to whom we would like to offer a position.

**Additional information**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it. However, if we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason that is compatible with the original purpose, we may do that. You can contact us if you want an explanation of how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do. If we need, we will ask your consent. However, we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, where this is required or permitted by law.

Your Privacy Rights
-------------------

You have many rights under applicable data protection laws in relation to your personal data. We listed your privacy rights in the table below.

You also have the right to complaint to the relevant supervisory authority for data protection. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority. Please contact us in the first place.

If you are a USA resident, see the “Consumers in the USA” section below for more information about your rights.

| **Objection against advertising** | You can object to the use of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time. Do one of the following:<br><br>* select the "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link in the email, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each communication; or<br>* contact us at [dataprotectionofficer@beyondtrust.com](mailto:dataprotectionofficer@beyondtrust.com) or at the other contacts listed at the end of this notice. |
