These Data Collection Tools collect technical and usage data that your browser sends to our websites such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at the BeyondTrust Network. These Data Collection Tools may also collect information about your IP address, clickstream behavior and product information.

No matter where your personal data may be transferred, we will always protect it as described in this Privacy Notice.

When we transfer personal data originating from the EU, the UK, or Switzerland, we use the following transfer mechanisms:

* Adequacy decisions, as adopted by the competent regulators ([EU Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en), [UK Secretary of State](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-international-data-transfers/international-data-transfers-building-trust-delivering-growth-and-firing-up-innovation#uk-adequacy), or [Swiss data protection authority](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/data-protection/handel-und-wirtschaft/transborder-data-flows.html)); or
* [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en) (SCCs), as amended or recognized by respectively the UK and Swiss regulators.

BeyondTrust carries out transfer impact assessments (TIAs) before transferring EU, UK, or Swiss personal data internationally. We also monitor the circumstances of the transfers, to ensure that the personal data is granted a level of protection substantially equivalent to the one provided under EU, UK, or Swiss law.

Where we transfer personal data originating from other countries, we rely on one of the transfer mechanisms provided by the applicable law in the given country. This may include, among others, an adequacy/equivalence decision, data transfer agreements, or your consent to the transfer.
