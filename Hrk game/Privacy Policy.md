**Disclosure of your personal data**

Except as set out in this privacy notice, we do not disclose personal data about any individual to third parties. We will share personal data only with the third-party organizations listed below and only for purposes outlined in section 6 of this document.

Companies that provide products and services to us such as professional advisors, IT systems suppliers and support, data storage, IT developers, web hosting, analytics companies.

We will disclose personal data when legally obligated to do so by governmental authorities, law enforcement or to protect our rights.

Our company may transfer or sell its assets. In the event of a sale, merger, or other transfer (hereinafter collectively “Change”) to a new owner, that Privacy Notice will no longer apply and you should consult the privacy notice of the acquiring entity for information on how your personal data may be used.

Any third party we share your personal data with is required to keep it secure and comply with the law. We do not permit our service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we will notify you when your personal data may be provided to third parties in ways other than listed above and will give you the option to prevent

**Data Transfer**

We are located in Estonia and so your personal data will be received and processed by us in Estonia. It may be necessary for us to disclose some of your personal data to our trusted suppliers who provide us with products or services that help us provide you with the service we contract them to deliver for you. All other suppliers directly involved in processing your data reside

**Keeping your information up to date**

It is important that our records are up-to-date. Some changes like a new phone number, email address, or address may not get updated automatically. You can update your personal information on your account settings page and we will make the change for you within 24 hours.

**Data risk & security**

We take multiple measures to ensure your personal data is secure. We will never share or use your information without getting consent first—and only for the purposes outlined in this policy.

**Retention of personal data**

We will not retain your personal data for longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. In the event of a complaint or legal dispute, we may retain some of your personal data for a longer period. We determine an appropriate retention period for personal data based on the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, our goal in collecting the information, as well as any legal obligations we have to retain it.

**The legal rights you have**

Under certain circumstances, by law, you may have the right to:

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you corrected.

Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your personal data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your personal data which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the personal data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your personal data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. This enables you to ask us to provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the personal data to perform a contract with you.

Right to withdraw consent: If you provide your consent to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you wish to withdraw your consent, we will take steps to ensure we no longer process your personal data for the purpose(s) you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.

In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, please contact us in writing using the information provided in section 13 below. We will need you to provide us with information to identify you on our records, we will also need proof of your identity and address and the information to which your request relates.

Please note that the settings page of your user account enables you to update, manage and download certain of your personal data and to disable your user account and delete \[all\] personal data associated with your user account.
