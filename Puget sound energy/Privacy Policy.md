### NOTICE CONCERNING CUSTOMER INFORMATION

Jump to:

* [Privacy Policy](#pp)

* [California Privacy Rights](#cpr)

* * *

This notice describes how Puget Sound Energy handles your personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and other personal information), including Customer Information collected by virtue of the customer-utility relationship.

PSE's business practices are regulated by the state Utilities and Transportation Commission. The UTC has regulations which limit how PSE may disclose Customer Information.

UTC regulations require PSE to obtain the customer's written or electronic permission before disclosing any Customer Information to affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties for purposes of marketing services or products that the customer is not subscribed to. In other words, before we provide your name, service address or other personal information to any service or product provider who intends to market new services or products to you, we must obtain your permission to do so first. If you choose not to give us permission, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties.

We may, however, insert marketing information into our billing packets. PSE also may share aggregated information, without your authorization to perform tasks related to our regulated utility business. Aggregate information will not contain any material which could personally identify any individual person, or customer.

We respect your privacy. For more information about our privacy policies, please us at 1-888-225-5773 or email [privacy@pse.com](mailto:privacy@pse.com).

### PRIVACY POLICY

PSE's policy is to protect the confidentiality of personal information and to comply with all laws governing the privacy and security of such information. "Personal information" includes your name, address, telephone number, and any other information capable of being associated with your household, "Customer Information" as defined in the Revised Code of Washington ("RCW") § 19.29A.010, and "personal information" as defined in RCW Chapter 19.255, and as otherwise defined by applicable law. PSE collects, retains, uses, and discloses personal information, including Customer Information, with your consent or in accordance with our business as a regulated utility service provider.

This Privacy Policy sets forth the principles that guide PSE’s treatment of personal information. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you, such as by revising the date at the top of this policy or by sending you a notice with your bill. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

If you are a California resident, please see the "California Privacy Rights" section.

#### Our Commitment

PSE takes its responsibility to maintain the confidentiality and security of personal information seriously. Our commitment to protect your personal information is reflected in these principles, which inform PSE's practices and procedures when dealing with such information:

* **Choice.** We will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes without your prior written consent.
* **Notice.** We will inform you about our privacy practices by posting a privacy policy on our Web site and through other appropriate means.
* **Confidentiality.** We will maintain the confidentiality of personal information and provide access to third parties only with your consent or to the extent necessary for PSE to perform duties directly related to PSE’s regulated utility business.
* **Security.** We will use reasonable security practices and procedures to safeguard all personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure.
* **Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations.** We will comply with all local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations applicable to the receipt, processing, storage, and sharing of personal information.

### MORE INFORMATION

#### What Personal Information Does PSE Collect?

For example, we collect information when you set up a utility account, use our mobile application, complete a survey, apply for a job, communicate with us through any channel, including but not limited to, through social media sites, and requesting customer support. The personal information we may collect directly from you includes:
    * Your name, email address, postal address, phone number, date of birth, username and password, and security code.

    * Professional, employment, or education information, if you apply for employment with PSE; and

* **Information We Receive When You Use Our Utility Services.** If you are a PSE utility services customer, our gas and electric meters collect information such as energy consumption, diagnostic and connection information, meter ID, and meter status data. In the case of solar customers, the meters collect the amount of electricity delivered back to the grid by you.
* **Information We Receive From Your Use of Our Other Services.** When you access or use our website or mobile application or services other than utility services, we may automatically collect some information in connection with those services too, including:
    * Your IP address, Internet service provider (ISP), mobile advertising ID, media access control (MAC) address, and identifiers associated with browser cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies we deploy on our services;
    * Records of products or services purchased; and
    * Your browser type and operating system version, language settings, access times, pages viewed, the routes by which you access our services, and your use of any hyperlinks available within our services.
* **Information We Collect From Other Sources.** Sometimes we also obtain information from other sources such as third-party agencies or identity verification services and combine that with information we collect through our services. The personal information we may collect from other sources may include:
    * Your name, signature, account number, address, telephone, and email address and social security number;
    * Your income range, age, disability status, household information, education level and type of employment, which we may collect to provide or offer you with low-income assistance or other benefits and services; and
    * Professional, employment, education and other background information in connection with your application for employment opportunities.
* **Information We Derive.** We may derive personal information or draw inferences about your preferences or characteristics based on the personal data we collect. For example, we may analyze your consumption history to infer your consumption patterns or tendencies so that we can better serve you.

#### Does PSE Share My Information with Third Parties?

We do not sell your personal information, nor do we share personal information about you with third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent.

We share your information with contractors or service providers that perform services on our behalf. For example, we may share your information with such parties that we have contracted with to provide customer support, web hosting, information technology, payment processing, product fulfilment, fraud control, analytics, or legal, insurance or accounting services. We may also provide your information, in appropriate circumstances, to law enforcement or other persons involved in a legal proceeding when necessary to comply with legal requirements or to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of PSE, our customers, our website users, our employees or the public. In addition, we may share personal information in the context of a corporate transaction; with your consent at your direction; or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Finally, we may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

#### What About Social Sharing Features?

PSE’s services online may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on our services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

#### How Does PSE Secure My Information?

PSE uses reasonable security practices and procedures to safeguard personal information within PSE’s possession or control from unauthorized access or disclosure.
