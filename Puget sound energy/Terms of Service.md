[Storm alert Updated Nov 21, 6:00 AM](#collapseOne)  

November Wind Storm
-------------------

Overnight, crews made steady progress restoring power to customers impacted by Tuesday’s windstorm, restoring more than half the total customers who’ve been affected since the start of the storm. However, we understand that for those still affected it remains incredibly challenging, especially with the cold conditions. For customers needing support, please check with your local government or call 211 to find warming shelters and other resources. King 5 also has this list of resources. We are working around the clock and will continue to do so until every customer is restored.

Crews have been able to restore power to 57 schools with known power outages over the last two days, with continued efforts to restore remaining schools, medical facilities and hospitals. The high winds and resulting tree damage not only downed the smaller, local power lines, but also damaged the larger transmission lines – the larger lines that bring power into communities. Crews are beginning to bring transmission lines back online; these lines need to be brought back into service before crews can focus on the local distribution system. Please note that as transmission comes online, there will be temporary spikes in data as those systems are energized, you may see numbers go up and down on the outage map as the process occurs.

Safety first. Never touch or go within 35 feet of downed power lines because they might be energized. Call PSE at [1-888-225-5773](tel:1-888-225-5773) or [911](tel:911) to report problems.
