Any non-public information which is received under this Agreement by one party from the other

or its respective affiliates and which is clearly marked as “confidential” or that a reasonable person

would consider to be confidential based on the nature of such information and/or the

circumstances surrounding its disclosure (“Confidential Information”) shall be (i) maintained in

obligated by the receiving party to protect the Confidential Information to the same extent as the

receiving party under this section “Confidentiality” and (b) disclosure with the prior written consent

of the disclosing party. Further, the receiving party is permitted to disclose any protected

Confidential Information of the disclosing party, to the extent required by law, on condition that in

possession without obligation of confidentiality at the time of its receipt from the receiving party;

Confidential Information of the disclosing party; (iii) the information was obtained from a third party

without obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (iv) the information was or becomes
