Financial institutions. Acorns uses Plaid Inc. (“Plaid”) to gather your data from financial institutions. By using the Service, you grant Acorns the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from your relevant financial institution.

For example, information subject to certain federal privacy laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability, is exempt from CCPA rights requests. We therefore may decline all, or part of your request related to exempt personal information. This means that we may not provide some, or all, of this personal information when you make a right to access request. We may also not delete or correct some, or all, personal information when you make a deletion or correction request.

Nothing here should be viewed as an endorsement or testimonial regarding Acorns Advisers LLC's investment advisory services. Acorns is not a bank.

Acorns may receive compensation from business partners in connection with certain promotions in which Acorns refers clients to such partners for the purchase of non-investment consumer products or services. This type of marketing partnership gives Acorns an incentive to refer clients to business partners instead of to businesses that are not partners of Acorns. This conflict of interest affects the ability of Acorns to provide clients with unbiased, objective promotions concerning the products and services of its business partners. This could mean that the products and/or services of other businesses, that do not compensate Acorns, may be more appropriate for a client than the products and/or services of Acorns business partners. Subscribers are, however, not required to purchase the products and services Acorns promotes. Amount earned and invested through Acorns Earn since inception as of July 1, 2024.

5\. Acorns **Subscription Fees** are assessed based on the plan of services in which you are enrolled. Acorns does not charge transactional fees, commissions or fees based on assets for accounts under $1 million. Acorns may receive compensation from business partners in connection with certain promotions in which Acorns refers clients to such partners for the purchase of non-investment consumer products or services. This type of marketing partnership gives Acorns an incentive to refer clients to business partners instead of to businesses that are not partners of Acorns. This conflict of interest affects the ability of Acorns to provide clients with unbiased, objective promotions concerning the products and services of its business partners.

Lincoln Savings Bank or nbkc bank utilizes a deposit network service, which means that at any given time, all, none, or a portion of the funds in your Acorns Checking accounts may be placed into and held beneficially in your name at other depository institutions which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
