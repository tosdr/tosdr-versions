THESE TERMS OF USE (THESE “TERMS OF USE”) CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS SET FORTH IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "BINDING ARBITRATION AND APPLICABLE LAW" BELOW, REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST ACORNS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, MEANING YOU CANNOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST ACORNS IN COURT, AND CONFIRMS YOUR AGREEMENT TO A CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN ARBITRATION. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. 

THESE TERMS OF USE DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACORNS ADVISERS LLC (THE “COMPANY” OR “WE” OR “US”) AND YOU, THE PERSON ACCESSING THE ACORNS WEBSITE LOCATED AT ACORNS.COM (THE “SITE”) AND/OR DOWNLOADING OUR MOBILE APPLICATION (THE “APPLICATION”) AND/OR REGISTERING FOR OUR SERVICES (“YOU” OR “YOUR”). YOU MAY USE THE SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ONLY IF YOU CAN FORM A BINDING CONTRACT WITH US AND ARE NOT A PERSON BARRED FROM RECEIVING SERVICES UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS OF USE ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY, ORGANIZATION, GOVERNMENT, OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO DO SO. IF YOU CANNOT CONFIRM THE FOREGOING, THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF USE AND MAY NOT USE THE SITE, THE APPLICATION OR SERVICES. YOU MAY USE THE SERVICES ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS OF USE AND ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

We may amend these Terms of Use at any time by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and Application. We may terminate these Terms of Use at any time by suspending or terminating access to the Site, Application and/or Services and/or notifying you. You can see when these Terms of Use were last revised by referring to the “Updated” legend above. Your continued use of the Site, Application or Services after we have posted revised Terms of Use signifies your acceptance of such revised Terms of Use. No amendment or modification of these Terms of Use will be binding unless in writing and signed by our duly authorized representative or posted to the Site and Application by our duly authorized representative.

Services

By using the Site and/or Application, you can use our interactive platform to obtain various investment advisory services (collectively, the “Services”). Our Services allow you to open an account to participate that we will manage at your direction in accordance with the wrap fee program we sponsor (the “Program”), to provide information about your financial situation and risk preferences, and, based on the information you provide, to obtain automated investment advice regarding the selection of a portfolio within the Program. We are always working on new ways to improve our Services. We reserve the right to modify or change our Site, the Application or any of the Services, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice to you, and we are not obligated to support or update the Site, the Application or any Services. You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party in the event that we exercise our right to modify, change or discontinue the Site, the Application or any Services. IF YOU DECIDE TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN THE PROGRAM, YOU MUST ENTER INTO AN ACORNS PROGRAM AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES AN INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT WITH US AND A BROKERAGE AND CUSTODY CUSTOMER AGREEMENT WITH OUR AFFILIATE, ACORNS SECURITIES, LLC (COLLECTIVELY, THE “AGREEMENTS”). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, IF YOU OPEN AN ACCOUNT IN THE PROGRAM AND ANY TERM IN THESE TERMS OF USE CONFLICTS WITH THE AGREEMENTS, THE AGREEMENTS SHALL CONTROL OVER THESE TERMS OF USE.

Wait List

Prior to the launch of features of the  Program, we may provide an opportunity for visitors to the Site to enter their email to join a wait list of visitors who wish to receive further information as such feature gets under way (a “Wait List”). If you join any Wait List, you acknowledge and agree that joining such Wait List does not and will not make you our client (or a customer of any of our affiliates), obligate us to provide you any services, or create any other legal or regulatory duty on our part, other than the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect your email in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.acorns.com/privacy/)[.](https://assets.acorns.com/fine-print/privacy-policy.html)

Agreement with Respect to Terms of Use

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement between the Company and you. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms of Use. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Use at any time on the acorns.com website. Additional terms, including without limitation those set forth in the Agreements, may govern your use of certain Web pages within the Site or sections within the Application. In the event that any provision, term or guideline contained on a particular Web page in the Site or section of the Application conflicts with these Terms of Use, the terms of such Web page or section shall control over these Terms of Use. You acknowledge that you have read these Terms of Use, and accept, understand and will be bound by such terms and conditions. You further acknowledge that these Terms and Conditions, together with the Privacy Policy and terms governing any individual Web page or Application feature, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us and supersede any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between us relating to your access or use of the Site, the Application and/or Services.

Registration

Certain features or services offered on or through the Site and Application may require you to open an account and set up a profile, providing certain personally-identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, your social security number or other tax identification number, your address, your email address, and certain information about your financial situation and risk preferences (collectively, your “Client Information”). We reserve the right to restrict certain areas of information on the Site and Application to such registered users. You agree that you will maintain and promptly update your Client Information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect such, we reserve the right to terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Site and/or Application by you. We are committed to your privacy, and our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), the terms of which are incorporated herein, explains the policies put in place and used by us to protect your Client Information and your privacy as you visit and use the Site and/or Application and use our Services. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your member name and password. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your member name, password, or account. The Company will not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your account and you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its managing members, officers, equity holders, employees, partners, parents, subsidiaries, agents, affiliates, and licensors (collectively, "Affiliates"), as applicable, for any improper, unauthorized or illegal uses of your account and as otherwise set forth in these Terms of Use.

Promotions and Referrals

We may, at our sole discretion, make available promotions with different features to any users or prospective users of our Site, Application or Services. These promotions, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your relationship with us. From time to time, we may offer you with incentives to refer new users to our Site, Application or Services. These incentives may come in the form of reward shares, and we may set or change the incentive types, amounts, terms, restrictions, and qualification requirements for any incentives at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to withhold or deduct reward shares or other benefits obtained through a promotion the event that we determine or believe that the receipt of the reward or benefit was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of these Terms of Use or an applicable referral agreement or program agreement.

Alerts and Notifications

As part of the Services, or in connection with the actions necessary to apply for the Services, you may receive notifications, alerts, emails, or other types of messages regarding the Services (for example, Two-Factor Verification, suspicious activity alerts, or money movement confirmations). We may also periodically send you emails that directly promote the Services and Program (for example, new offerings or features we provide, recommendations, special offers or promotions). When you receive such promotional emails from us you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive. When you access the Site, the Application or any of the other features of the Program through a mobile network, your network or roaming provider’s messaging data and other rates and fees may apply. You are solely responsible for any carrier charges incurred as a result of phone and/or text communications from Acorns. Acorns and Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. 

Acorns Two-factor Authentication

You can opt into two-factor authentication. When you do, Acorns will send verification codes to the phone number on file via SMS text messages.

You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Just text “STOP” to the short code. After you send the SMS message “STOP” to us, we will send you an SMS message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. After this, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. If you want to join again, just sign up as you did the first time and we will start sending SMS messages to you again.

If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or you can get help directly at [https://help.acorns.com](https://help.acorns.com/).

Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

As always, message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to you from us and to us from you. You will receive verification codes via SMS whenever you need to verify an authentication. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your carrier.

If you have any questions regarding privacy, please read our privacy policy: [https://www.acorns.com/privacy](https://www.acorns.com/privacy)

Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees, cost and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator and JAMS; however, the Arbitrator may award to the prevailing party reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including, for example, expert witness fees and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the Arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after conclusion of the arbitration, the Arbitrator shall issue a written award and a written statement of decision describing the material factual findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. Each party shall fully perform and satisfy the arbitration award within fifteen (15) days of the service of the award. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, you understand that you are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a claim or dispute were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, the right bring a claim as a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and the right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.

**Paid advertisement.** Dwayne Johnson is an investor in Acorns Grow Incorporated, is a director of its affiliate Acorns Labs, is an Acorns customer, and together with his creative agency receives substantial compensation from Acorns and its affiliates to promote Acorns and therefore has a conflict of interest that can be expected to bias his views.

Nothing here should be viewed as an endorsement or testimonial regarding Acorns Advisers LLC's investment advisory services. Acorns is not a bank. Acorns Visa™ debit cards and banking services are issued and provided by Lincoln Savings Bank or nbkc bank, Members FDIC, to Acorns Checking account holders that are U.S. residents over the age of eighteen (18).

Acorns may receive compensation from business partners in connection with certain promotions in which Acorns refers clients to such partners for the purchase of non-investment consumer products or services. This type of marketing partnership gives Acorns an incentive to refer clients to business partners instead of to businesses that are not partners of Acorns. This conflict of interest affects the ability of Acorns to provide clients with unbiased, objective promotions concerning the products and services of its business partners. This could mean that the products and/or services of other businesses, that do not compensate Acorns, may be more appropriate for a client than the products and/or services of Acorns business partners. Subscribers are, however, not required to purchase the products and services Acorns promotes. Amount earned and invested through Acorns Earn since inception as of July 1, 2024.

5\. Acorns **Subscription Fees** are assessed based on the plan of services in which you are enrolled. Acorns does not charge transactional fees, commissions or fees based on assets for accounts under $1 million. Acorns may receive compensation from business partners in connection with certain promotions in which Acorns refers clients to such partners for the purchase of non-investment consumer products or services.
