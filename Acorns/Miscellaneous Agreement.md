* Acorns Personal: For a $3 monthly Subscription Fee, this Tier allows you to have an Acorns Checking Account, an Acorns Invest Account (Base Portfolio), and one or more Acorns Later Accounts, provided that the Combined Monthly Balance among your Portfolio Accounts, if any, on the Fee Date is less than $1,000,000;
* Acorns Personal Plus: For a $5 monthly Subscription Fee, this Tier allows you to have an Acorns Checking Account, Acorns Invest Accounts (Base Portfolio), and one or more Acorns Later Accounts, provided that the Combined Monthly Balance among your Portfolio Accounts, if any, on the Fee Date is less than $1,000,000;

* If your Combined Monthly Balance on the Fee Date is $1,000,000 or more and you have an Acorns Early Account, Acorns Checking Account, $100 per $1,000,000 of Combined Monthly Balance on the Fee Date (for the avoidance of doubt, the Subscription Fee in that scenario will be one hundredth of one percent (.01%) of the number obtained by rounding your Combined Monthly Balance down to the nearest whole multiple of $1,000,000) plus $5; and

The amount of the Subscription Fee depends on which Subscription Tier you select, and, in certain cases, the Combined Monthly Balance in your Portfolio Accounts.

You acknowledge (1) that the Subscription Fee is a fixed fee based on the Subscription Tier in which you are enrolled and, depending on your circumstances, may be disproportionately high relative to the assets in your Portfolio Account, and (2) that the Subscription Fee is reasonable for the services you receive regardless of the assets in your Portfolio Account.

See Schedule 1 below for additional fees that might apply to your Account(s), as applicable.

       4.2 Debit Authorization to Pay Subscription Fee

PREAUTHORIZATION OF MONTHLY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER FROM YOUR FUNDING SOURCE: By clicking “I agree” to enter into this Program Agreement, you authorize Acorns and any of its agents, for the entire period in which you are subject to a Subscription Fee under this Section 4, to process a recurring ACH debit from your Funding Source in the amount specified in this Section 4. Any ACH debit that you preauthorize in the preceding sentence will result in an electronic funds transfer from your Funding Source to Acorns to pay, if applicable, the Subscription Fee. Acorns or any of its agents may charge a fee if your ACH debit fails due to insufficient funds in your Funding Source. 

The normal way that you will pay the Subscription Fee specified in Section 4.1 is by a single recurring monthly ACH debit and electronic funds transfer that will deduct money from your Primary Funding Source. If Acorns is unable to collect your Subscription Fee via ACH payment from your Primary Funding Source, you authorize Acorns and/or its agents to collect your Subscription Fee by ACH payment from your Secondary Funding Source, if any. You authorize Acorns and/or its agents to initiate the recurring monthly debit from your Primary and/or Secondary Funding Source, or through the sale of ETF shares or Stocks in your Account (e.g., Custom Portfolio), as described in Section A6.3 of the Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement. If Acorns is unable to collect your Subscription Fee via ACH payment from your Secondary Funding Source, Acorns may collect fees relating to your Account(s) as set forth in Schedule 1. Acorns reserves the right to cease offering you services under this Program Agreement if you revoke your electronic authorization or Acorns is unable to collect your Subscription Fee.

       4.3 Liquidation of Portfolio Account Holdings to Pay Fees

Under Section A6.3 of the Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement, Acorns Advisers may at any time in its sole discretion instruct Acorns Securities to initiate sales in one or more of your Portfolio Accounts as necessary and use the proceeds to pay any current or past fees due to Acorns Advisers, Acorns Securities or the IRA Custodian and Administrator under this Program Agreement (including the Supplements) relating to your Acorns Invest Account, Acorns Early Account, and/or Acorns Later Account(s), including at any time when Acorns Advisers has been unable for any reason to collect your Subscription Fee by debiting your Primary or Secondary Funding Source.  
  
If Acorns Advisers liquidates Shares to satisfy your monthly Subscription Fee, it may continue to liquidate securities to cover your Subscription Fee, or it may attempt to collect from your Primary or Secondary Funding Source. 

       4.4 Discretion to Waive or Customize Fees

You acknowledge that the Subscription Fee is not negotiable. Acorns reserves the right to waive or customize the Subscription Fee, or any part of the Subscription Fee at any time, for any period, and for any client at its sole and absolute discretion.

         4.4.1 Initiatives with Waived Fees

Acorns may, from time to time, elect to launch promotions or other initiatives whereby Subscription Fees may be waived, in whole or in part, for certain categories of clients (such as, for example, students, clients below a certain age and/or military veterans). Any such initiative (i) may be expanded, narrowed, suspended, canceled or modified at any time by Acorns in its sole discretion; and (ii) will be subject to rules, guidelines and/or terms and conditions, if any, that Acorns determines in its sole discretion to apply in connection therewith (which rules, guidelines and/or terms may be included in website landing pages, on the Acorns Website generally and/or elsewhere). To the extent that any such program or initiative is canceled or terminated, Acorns will, after giving impacted clients notice, begin prospectively charging clients the then-current Subscription Fees pursuant to the preauthorization in the applicable Supplement(s). You agree and acknowledge that Acorns will have sole discretion in determining whether or not any Existing Client or Prospective Client meets the requirements to participate in and/or benefit from any such program or initiative, and Acorns will not be liable to you or any other party in connection with any such decision and/or in connection with the administration of any such program or initiative generally.

Either party may terminate this Program Agreement at any time upon notice to the other party as provided in this Program Agreement; provided that either party may terminate this Program Agreement immediately on a material breach of this Program Agreement or any Supplement by the other party. Termination will not affect the rights or obligations of the parties prior to the date of termination.  

       9.2 Suspension of Services

You agree that an Acorns Party and the Banks of Record, and any of their affiliates or contractors, may suspend the provision of services to you or delay, limit, restrict, or refuse any transaction for you at any time for any length of time without prior notice to you if the Acorns Party or the Bank of Record believes in good faith that such suspension or delay is necessary or appropriate (i) to ensure compliance with, or avoid, violating any law or regulation applicable to the particular Acorns Party, the Bank of Record, or a transaction relating to the Program; (ii) to comply with a request or guidance from a regulatory or law enforcement authority with jurisdiction over the Acorns Party, the Bank of Record, or a transaction relating to the Program; (iii) to avoid a loss to you, the Acorns Party, or the Bank of Record; (iv) to remediate or otherwise address problems with technology; (v) due to interruptions in the access to or operation of any technology that the Acorns Party or the Bank of Record directly or indirectly uses in connection with the Program; or (vi) as a result of, or to prevent, a breach or violation of any term, condition, or other provision of any Supplement, including but not limited to a breach or violation of the Referral Agreement.

If an Acorns Party and the Bank of Record suspend all services under the Program, including the management of invested funds in your accounts, Acorns Advisers will credit to your Portfolio Account or transfer to your Funding Source (including your Acorns Checking Account, as applicable) the prorated Subscription Fee for the period during which all services for your Portfolio Accounts and/or Acorns Checking Account were suspended. If an Acorns Party or the Bank of Record suspends your access to the Platform temporarily, you will continue to be charged your Subscription Fee while your account remains in a suspended state.  

       9.3 Voluntary Subscription Termination

You agree that if you elect to terminate your subscription to the Platform, each of your Accounts and Acorns Checking Accounts must first be closed and liquidated pursuant to this Program Agreement and terms of the applicable Supplements.

    10. **Reward Shares**

From time to time, you may be granted Reward Shares in an Earn Rewards promotion funded by an Acorns Party. You agree that you may not initiate a sale of Reward Shares, a Withdrawal of the proceeds of a sale of Reward Shares, or include the Reward Shares in a transfer of ETF Shares or Stock to a broker-dealer other than Acorns Securities until the earlier of (i) the day after you make a Deposit into your Acorns Invest Account of an amount greater than or equal to the current value of the Reward Shares; or (ii) the day after you have kept your Acorns Invest Account open for the entire Retention Period. 

If you never make a Deposit of an amount greater than or equal to the current value of the Reward Shares and do not keep your Acorns Invest Account open for the Retention Period, you will not be able to use the Reward Shares for a Withdrawal or include the Reward Shares in any transfer of ETF Shares or Stock to a broker-dealer other than Acorns Securities. You acknowledge that the Reward Shares, like any other ETF Shares or Stocks, may decline in value or be used to pay some or all of the Subscription Fee or other charges in accordance with the Supplements. You acknowledge and agree that Acorns Advisers, any affiliate of Acorns Advisers, or Acorns Securities may receive compensation from one or more third parties in connection with an Earn Rewards promotion relating to an Acorns Invest Account, including compensation that is more than the value of the Reward Shares you receive into an Acorns Invest Account as Earn Rewards in connection with the promotion. Reward Shares promotions do not apply to Acorns Later Accounts.

You agree that Acorns Advisers or Acorns Securities may reverse any Reward Shares credited to your Acorns Invest Account if you are found to have engaged in any fraudulent or illegal activity with respect to any Acorns Account, or have otherwise breached the terms of the Referral Agreement. To the extent that your Acorns Invest Account does not have adequate funds to repay the Reward Shares, the provisions of Section 4.3 will apply.

       11.4 Independent Contractors

None of the Acorns Parties will be liable for the acts or omissions of their vendors or other contractors, including the ACH Operator, the Clearing Broker, the Banks of Record, or any third party participating in a Promotion relating to Earn Rewards. Without limiting the foregoing, Acorns Advisers and Acorns Pay do not warrant or guarantee that any or all money, credits, or other property that might be necessary to fund Earn Rewards in a promotion will be received in connection with the Program. Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of any Earn Rewards promotion, you acknowledge and agree that you will have no right to receive any Earn Rewards from Acorns Advisers’ or Acorns Pay’s parent company or any of its affiliates, to the extent any third party fails to pay Acorns Advisers’ or Acorns Pay’s parent company in connection with the applicable promotion.

       11.5 Automated Clearing House (ACH) Transactions

You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to provide correct and legitimate payment instructions for your Funding Source to Acorns Advisers, Acorns Securities, Acorns Pay, and the ACH Operator when requested in connection with the Program. You agree to be bound by the National Automated Clearing House Association operating rules and any applicable local ACH operating rules. You acknowledge that mismatched, incorrect, or incomplete identifying information regarding your Funding Source or in payment instructions to make a Deposit or Round-Ups® Deposit or pay Subscription Fees may result in an ACH transfer being rejected, lost, posted to an incorrect account or returned to the bank that maintains your Funding Source without notice to you. You agree that Acorns Advisers and/or Acorns Pay may request and the ACH Operator or Carrying Broker may make ACH transfers for Withdrawals solely by reference to the account number of the recipient. Acorns Parties, and the ACH Operator will not be obligated by any provision of any Supplement to determine whether there is a discrepancy relating to names or account numbers in transfers between any of your Accounts and your Funding Source. You agree to indemnify and hold all Acorns Parties, and the other Indemnified Persons harmless from any and all damages resulting from or relating to any mismatched, incorrect, or incomplete identifying information regarding your Funding Source or in payment instructions for an ACH transfer to make a Deposit, Round-Ups® Deposit, or Withdrawal, or pay Subscription Fees. You agree that processing of ACH transfers for Deposits, Round-Ups® Deposits, Withdrawals, or Subscription Fees may be delayed for five (5) Business Days or longer. If you believe that a transfer has not been properly credited to you, you agree to notify Acorns Advisers and/or Acorns Pay promptly. You agree that money transferred from your Funding Source may not be reflected in a Deposit or Round-Ups® Deposit credited to your Portfolio Account(s) or available during delays. 

YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN YOUR FUNDING SOURCE TO COVER ALL DEPOSITS AND ROUND-UPS® DEPOSITS. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN OVERDRAFT OR OTHER FEES BY YOUR BANKING INSTITUTION THAT MAINTAINS YOUR FUNDING SOURCE. SUCH FEES ARE NOT COLLECTED OR IMPOSED BY THE ACORNS PARTIES. You agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Supplement, Acorns Advisers, Acorns Securities, Acorns Pay and the Indemnified Persons will not be liable for ACH transfer-processing delays; any act or omission of, including any overdraft or other fee charged by, any financial institution that maintains your Funding Source or Linked Card(s); or for any act or omission of any service provider or vendor of any such financial institution. Any credit resulting from an ACH transfer associated with a Deposit, Round-Ups® Deposit or payment of any Subscription Fee is provisional until Acorns Securities receives payment. Without limiting any other rights of Acorns Advisers, Acorns Securities, or Acorns Pay to delay a Withdrawal or deny a request for a Withdrawal, Acorns Advisers, Acorns Securities, and Acorns Pay reserve the right to delay or prevent a Withdrawal of the proceeds of any Deposit or Round-Ups® Deposit pending verification of final payment. If Acorns Securities does not receive final payment, or if any of your Account(s) have been credited by mistake, you authorize Acorns Advisers to instruct Acorns Securities to reverse the credit to your affected Account(s) or you will otherwise reimburse Acorns Securities if assets in your affected Account(s) are not sufficient. If a payment funding a Deposit or Round-Ups® Deposit does not become final, the originator (which is you in the case of a Deposit or Round-Ups® Deposit originating in your Funding Source, your employer in the case of an employer contribution to an Acorns Traditional IRA Custodial Account that is a simplified employee pension plan individual retirement account, and the holder of Earn Rewards in the case of an Acorns Invest Account receiving Earn Rewards) will not be deemed to have paid you in your applicable Account. 

         11.5.1 Recurring Transfers

You authorize Acorns Advisers, Acorns Securities, Acorns Pay, and/or the Banks of Record when acting as Service Providers to make recurring electronic debits and credits to your Funding Source or Acorns Checking Account as initiated by you for the amounts and frequencies you identify, and, if necessary, to correct erroneous debits and credits. The Service Providers’ authorization to initiate debit and credit entries from and to your Funding Source or Acorns Checking Account will remain in full force and effect until you notify a Service Provider that you wish to revoke this authorization with respect to a particular Service Provider by emailing support@acorns.com or making such changes in the Application, if available and the applicable Service Provider has acknowledged such revocation. You must notify the Service Providers at least three (3) Business Days before the scheduled debit date in order to cancel this authorization. If the Service Providers do not receive notice at least three (3) Business Days before the scheduled debit date, the Service Providers may attempt, in their sole discretion, to cancel the debit transaction. However, the Service Providers assume no responsibility for their failure to do so. Please note that withdrawal of your electronic authorization contained in this Section will not apply to ACH transactions taking place before the withdrawal of your authorization becomes effective.

In accordance with this Program Agreement, you represent that the transfers you authorize comply with applicable law. The Service Providers reserve the right to delay or prevent transfers of funds in accordance with applicable laws.

    13. **Dispute Resolution - Mandatory Arbitration**

**This Program Agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause. Mandatory, individual arbitration applies to this Program Agreement and each Supplement and governs each contract, all transactions thereunder, and/or any other interactions between the parties that relate to such contractual relationship. By affirmatively confirming your consent to this Program Agreement, the Acorns Parties and you agree as follows:**

* **Except for individual complaints filed in small claims court consistent with the applicable jurisdictional limits or unless you opt-out as described below, the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for resolution of any claims will be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this Section.**
* **All parties to this Program Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed or otherwise in this Dispute Resolution provision.**
* **Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party’s ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.**
* **The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.**
* **The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least twenty (20) days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.**
* **The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.**
* **The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.**
* **The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, will be incorporated into this Program Agreement.**

**Mandatory Arbitration: All controversies that may arise between you and Acorns Securities concerning any subject matter, issue, or circumstance whatsoever (including controversies concerning any Account, Order, or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation, or breach of this Program Agreement, the Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement, the Brokerage Supplement, or any other agreement between you and Acorns Advisers or Acorns Securities, whether entered into or arising before, on, or after the date this account is opened) will be determined by binding arbitration through FINRA to the extent applicable. For more information, including instructions on how to file an arbitration demand with FINRA, please visit [https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/learn-about-arbitration](https://www.finra.org/arbitration-mediation/learn-about-arbitration). Any disputes between you and Acorns Securities that cannot be arbitrated before FINRA will be determined by binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules and procedures and, where appropriate, the then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by this mandatory arbitration provision. See below for more information.**

**All controversies that may arise between you and Acorns, Acorns Advisers, and/or Acorns Pay concerning any account, order, or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation, or breach of this Program Agreement, the Checking Account Supplement, or any other agreement between you and Acorns, Acorns Advisers, and/or Acorns Pay, whether entered into or arising before, on, or after the date this Account is opened, will be determined by binding arbitration through the AAA under its rules and procedures and, where appropriate, the then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by this mandatory arbitration provision. For more information, including instructions about how to file an arbitration demand with AAA, please visit [https://adr.org/consumer](https://adr.org/consumer)  [or call 800-778-7879](about:blank).**

**You and the Acorns Parties acknowledge that judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.**

**This Section 13 survives the end of the relationship between you and the Acorns Parties, including without limitation cancelation or termination of this Program Agreement, the Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement (Supplement A), the Brokerage Supplement (Supplement B), and the Checking Account Supplement (Supplement G) and any opt-out by you of electronic communications.** 

**Location and costs of arbitration: Unless you and the relevant Acorns Party agree to conduct arbitration by teleconference, videoconference, or otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in Irvine, California. Except for a dispute determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous or initiated in bad faith, Acorns will pay all filing fees and reimburse you for documented expenses up to a total amount of $2,000 and waives any rights it may have to recover an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses against you.**

**Claims against multiple entities: If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law and/or regulatory rules, including FINRA rules, preclude enforcement of this arbitration provision as to a particular claim for relief against a particular entity, then that claim (and only that claim) against that entity (and only that entity) must be severed from the arbitration provision and may be brought in court. Any other claims you have against any other entities that are not precluded from being arbitrated will remain subject to binding arbitration. For avoidance of doubt, this means that you agree to binding arbitration for all claims against all applicable entities to the maximum extent allowable under applicable law, even though you may have to proceed in different forums for the same or similar claims against different entities.**

**NO CLASS ACTIONS: NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT. UNLESS CONSENTED TO IN WRITING BY ALL PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION, NO PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION MAY JOIN, CONSOLIDATE, OR OTHERWISE BRING CLAIMS FOR OR ON BEHALF OF TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUALS OR UNRELATED CORPORATE ENTITIES IN THE SAME ARBITRATION UNLESS THOSE PERSONS ARE PARTIES TO A SINGLE TRANSACTION.** 

**Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, and except for public injunctive relief awarded under California law, an award in arbitration will determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any claim of anyone other than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator will have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this section, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, will be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this class waiver section will be determined exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.**

**Arbitration opt-out: If you do not agree to arbitrate disputes as detailed herein, you may opt out of this arbitration provision for all purposes by sending an arbitration opt-out notice to support@acorns.com, within thirty (30) days of the date of your electronic acceptance of the terms of this Program Agreement or within thirty (30) days after we notify you regarding any material changes to this Section 13.

**PRODUCT TERMS AND CONDITIONS SUPPLEMENT**

This Product Terms and Conditions Supplement (“Supplement”) is part of this Program Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Supplement, defined terms have the same meaning as in this Program Agreement. In the event any provision in this Supplement conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of this Program Agreement, the provisions of this Supplement will control for matters or services related to this Supplement. When you open an Acorns Portfolio Account (i.e., Acorns Invest Account, Acorns Early Account, Acorns Later Account or any combination thereof) the applicable product terms will apply to you at such time. 

    1. **Portfolio Accounts**

       **1.1** **Advisory Charge**  
  

When you open a Portfolio Account, a portion of your Subscription Fee charged by Acorns Advisers will be allocated to the Advisory Charge. 

For the purposes of any reporting of your Portfolio Accounts’ performance we may provide from time to time, Acorns will attribute some or all of the Advisory Charge, which is a portion of your Subscription Fee, to your Portfolio Accounts as follows:

* if your only account in the Program is an Acorns Invest Account with a Monthly Invest Balance on the Fee Date of less than $1,000,000, any Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Invest Account; if you also have an Acorns Later Account, the Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Invest Account if it has a positive balance; 
* if your Acorns Invest Account does not have a positive balance, the Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Later Account or to the first Acorns Later Account you set up if you have more than one.
* if your Acorns Invest Account does not have a positive balance but there is a positive balance in your Acorns Later Account or Acorns Early Account, the Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Later Account or to the first Acorns Later Account you set up if you have more than one.
* if your Acorns Invest Account and your Acorns Early Account do not have a positive balance but there is a positive balance in your Acorns Later Account, the Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Later Account or to the first Acorns Later Account you set up if you have more than one.
* if your Acorns Invest Account and your Acorns Later Account do not have a positive balance but there is a positive balance in your Acorns Early Account, the Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Early Account or to the first Acorns Early Account you set up if you have more than one.
* if your Combined Monthly Balance on the Fee Date is $1,000,000 or more, your Advisory Charge will be attributed on a pro rata basis according to the Portfolio Account Value of each of your Portfolio Accounts.

For users who enrolled with Acorns before May 20, 2020, and certain other users. that have their entire Subscription Fee allocated to the Advisory Charge as described herein and are enrolled in a subscription Tier that includes an Acorns Invest Account and Acorns Later Account(s) with a Combined Monthly Balance on the Fee Date of less than $1,000,000, half the Advisory Charge will be attributed to your Acorns Invest Account and half will be attributed to your Acorns Later Account. For any user with more than one Acorns Later Account, then the portion of any Advisory Charge that is attributable to your Acorns Later Accounts will be attributed in equal portions among your Acorns Later Accounts, regardless of the value of any of your Acorns Later Accounts.

Additional portions of your Subscription Fee incurred in connection with choosing additional products or accounts, and not otherwise described above, will not be attributed to your Portfolio Accounts for the purposes of reporting performance of those accounts.

Acorns will not charge you any fee for the Advisory Services other than the Advisory Charge, which is included in your Subscription Fee when charged by Acorns, provided that Acorns or any of its agents may charge a fee if a Deposit, including any Deposit at Will or Round-Ups® Deposit, or the payment of any Subscription Fee fails due to insufficient funds in your Funding Source. Acorns Securities will not charge you any fee in connection with the Program other than the Advisory Charge unless you request services beyond the Covered Brokerage Services. Acorns Pay will not charge you any fee in connection with the Banking Services other than the Program Charge, which is included in your Subscription Fee when charged by Acorns. Additional fees for specially requested services beyond the Advisory Services, the Covered Brokerage Services, and the Banking Services are described in Section 4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Program Agreement, you agree that, if you request the preparation and delivery of paper documents that Acorns or Acorns Securities normally provides in electronic form or that Acorns and Acorns Securities are not required to provide in paper form, Acorns or Acorns Securities may charge you additional fees for the preparation and delivery of such paper documents.

The Bank of Record for your Acorns Checking Account will not charge you any fee in connection with an Acorns Checking Account, however you may incur fees for out-of-network ATMs or special services.

       **1.2 Fees in Negligible Portfolio Situations**

* If your only Portfolio Account is an Acorns Invest Account with a Portfolio Account Value on your Fee Date of less than $1, Acorns reserves the right, in its discretion, to waive any amount of the Subscription Fee due in excess of the Portfolio Account Value and close the Acorns Invest Account and collect the remaining balance in partial payment of your fees owed to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.
* If your only Portfolio Account is an Acorns Early Account with a Portfolio Account Value on your Fee Date of less than $1, Acorns reserves the right, in its discretion, to waive any amount of the Subscription Fee due in excess of the Portfolio Account Value and close the Acorns Early Account and collect the remaining balance in partial payment of your fees owed to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.
* If you have an Acorns Later Account with a Portfolio Account Value of less than $1 on your Fee Date, we will generally attempt to contact you for further instructions and may, in our sole discretion pending your instructions, suspend recurring ACH debits from your Funding Source. We reserve the right to request that the IRA Custodian and Administrator close any Acorns Later Accounts where the Portfolio is excessively low for too long, as Acorns determines in its sole discretion. Potential tax-related consequences of closing your account without a rollover are described in the following: for Acorns Traditional IRA Custodial Accounts, the Acorns Traditional IRA Custodial Account Supplement and the IRA Disclosure; and, for Acorns Roth IRA Custodial Accounts, the Acorns Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement and the IRA Disclosure.
* If you have no assets in your Base Invest Account, Early Account or Later Account, and have a balance in your Custom Portfolio Account, Acorns reserves the right, in its discretion, to waive any amount of the Subscription Fee due and close the corresponding Invest Account, Early Account or Later Account with no charge and/or collect any remaining balance in partial payment of your fees owed to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

       **1.3 Incompatibility of Fee Structure with Infrequent Small Investments**  
  

You acknowledge that Acorns designed the Program with frequent investing in mind and that the fee structure might not be economical or appropriate for individuals looking to make few or infrequent small-dollar investments. You acknowledge that the Subscription Fee may exceed the aggregate costs of separately purchasing the individual services that comprise the Advisory Services, Covered Brokerage Services, and, if applicable, services the IRA Custodian and Administrator provides as custodian and administrator of Acorns Later Accounts.

       **1.4 ETF Expenses**  
  

You acknowledge that the ETFs that Acorns Advisers recommends and that comprise the Portfolios charge their own fees and/or expenses. The deduction of the fees and expenses of the ETFs from the ETFs’ average net assets, as well as the ETFs’ brokerage fees and other costs and charges, are reflected in the price of the ETF Shares and are not separately deducted from your Portfolio Account. The fees and expenses charged by the ETFs are separate and distinct from our Subscription Fee. You acknowledge that you have access to information about the fees charged and costs incurred by the ETFs in the prospectuses delivered on Acorns’ behalf by its service provider via email. 

       **1.5 Termination of Subscription and Portfolio Accounts**  
  

You, Acorns Advisers, or Acorns Securities may close any or all of your Portfolio Accounts and terminate your Subscription, this Program Agreement, and any Supplement at any time for any reason. You may close any or all of your Portfolio Accounts and terminate this Program Agreement or any Supplement by sending an email request via support@acorns.com or by mailing a signed written request. When you, Acorns Advisers, or Acorns Securities closes any or all of your Portfolio Accounts, the following shall apply:

* if you terminate any Supplement with respect to any Portfolio Account, you will be deemed to simultaneously terminate all of the Supplements with respect to that Portfolio Account;
    
* Acorns Securities will, before closing your Portfolio Account, settle any purchases or sales pending when Acorns initiates or receives a request to close your Portfolio Account;
    
* Acorns will notify the IRA Custodian and Administrator regarding any instructions to close an Acorns Later Account;
    
* you, not Acorns or any of its affiliates or agents, will be responsible for providing any instructions or other information required or requested by the IRA Custodian and Administrator in connection with the closing of any Acorns Later Account;
    
* the IRA Custodian and Administrator may, in accordance with the Acorns Traditional IRA Custodial Account Supplement or the Acorns Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement, whichever applies, charge a fee to conduct a “rollover” of an IRA account held by another trustee or custodian into your Acorns Later Account; 
    
* Acorns and/or Acorns Securities may, before closing your Portfolio Account, deduct any unpaid and prorated portion of the respective Subscription Fees owed for the day Acorns received your closure instruction and the days prior and any other fees owed for specially requested services or irregular occurrences, including, but not limited to, paper delivery of documents, transfer of ETF Shares or Stock, or physical delivery of ETF Shares or Stock; and
    
* if Acorns Advisers and/or Acorns Securities closes your Portfolio Account as a result of your failure to pay any fees due, the Acorns Parties reserve the right to pursue payment of such fees.  
    

If you request to close any Acorns Invest Account or Acorns Early Account, Acorns will initiate a sale, instructing Acorns Securities to sell all ETF Shares in your Acorns Base Portfolio, or Acorns Early Account, or Stock in your Acorns Custom Portfolio, and to send the Cash, less any portion of the Subscription Fee and other fees due, to your Funding Source. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you explicitly request when you close your Acorns Invest Account or your Acorns Early Account that ETF Shares or Stock be transferred to another broker-dealer, Acorns will instruct Acorns Securities to transfer, in accordance with your instructions, the ETF Shares and/or Stock remaining after each of the following are paid for with the proceeds of a sale: any Withdrawals pending when the termination notice was received or sent by Acorns Advisers, any portion of the Subscription Fees due, the fees charged for processing the in-kind transfer to another broker-dealer, and any other fees due. If you request to close any Acorns Later Account that you participate in, the closing transactions will be processed in accordance with the Later Supplements. 

       **1.6 Investment Risks**

You acknowledge that:

* The services provided under this Supplement, including any Suggested Portfolio, are highly reliant on the accuracy of information you provide to Acorns. If you provide inaccurate information, it could materially impact the quality and applicability of advice you receive through the Program.
* Any Suggested Portfolio methodology focuses on your investment time horizon and risk tolerance. There are many other components of information that are not currently considered by Acorns Advisers in making recommendations. If you believe that there is additional information relating to your investment objectives and financial circumstances that should be considered to inform investment advice the Program provides, this may not be the appropriate Program for you.
* The ETF Shares and/or Stock in your Portfolio Account(s) may increase or decrease in value.
* Money invested in your Portfolio Account(s) is subject to market risk and the loss of up to the amount invested.
* Past performance, including model back-tested performance of any Suggested Portfolio, any Selected Portfolio, or other Portfolios, does not guarantee future results.
* Investment performance of any kind can never be guaranteed. Neither Acorns Advisers nor Acorns Securities represents or warrants the present or future level of risk or volatility in, or the future performance of, the Suggested Portfolio, your Selected Portfolio, other Portfolios, or your Portfolio Account(s).
* Performance of the Suggested Portfolio, your Selected Portfolio, other Portfolios, or your Portfolio Account(s) may differ materially from investment gains and avoidance of investment losses projected, described, or otherwise referenced in forward-looking statements.
* All Acorns Early Accounts participate in the Aggressive Portfolio.
* By participating in the Program, you may lose opportunities to make other investments and to realize gains from such other investments.
* Data provided by any Acorns Party or third-party service provider may not be free from error or inaccuracies.
* Investments in Portfolio Accounts are not guaranteed by the FDIC, any bank, or any government. 

       **1.7 Acorns Early Beneficiary Information**

You acknowledge and agree that, with respect to each Acorns Early Account, the law of the applicable custodian’s state of residence will govern the determination of the maximum age with respect to the age of transfer. The age of transfer varies by state, although most states set the maximum age for transfer at either 18 or 21, and certain states permit a custodian to elect to extend custodianship to age 25. You agree and acknowledge that you are responsible under the UGMA/UTMA for determining the proper age of transfer and that Acorns is not responsible for doing so. Once the age of transfer is selected, it cannot be modified. Questions about transfer age should be directed to a legal or tax advisor.

         **1.8.1 Termination of Acorns Checking Accounts**  
  

If you should choose to close your Acorns Checking Account, notify Acorns Customer Service in the Application, by email at support@acorns.com, or by calling (855) 739-2859. If your Acorns Checking Account remains at a zero balance for more than three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days, we or the Bank of Record may close such account. If your Acorns Checking Account has a negative balance for forty-five (45) consecutive days, and we are unable to bring your account to a zero balance under the Netting in the Checking Account Supplement (Supplement F), we or the Bank of Record may close such account. For accounts closed with a negative balance, we and the relevant Bank of Record reserve all rights under law and equity to take actions to cause you to reimburse us for the losses incurred on your account. We and the Bank of Record reserve the right to close your Acorns Checking Account and your Acorns Portfolio Accounts if we suspect fraudulent activity has occurred or your accounts are otherwise in poor standing. For additional information on Acorns Checking Accounts, see the Checking Account Supplement (Supplement F).

         **1.8.2 Smart Deposit**  
  

You authorize the Service Providers to make electronic debits and credits to your Acorns Checking Account, Acorns Invest Account, Acorns Early Account(s), and Acorns Later Account as initiated by you for the amounts and frequencies you identify in the Smart Deposit feature, and, if necessary, to correct erroneous debits and credits. The Service Providers’ authorization to initiate debit and credit entries to your Acorns Checking Account, Acorns Invest Account, Acorns Early Account(s), and Acorns Later Account will remain in full force and effect until you notify the Service Providers that you wish to revoke this authorization by making such changes in the Application. You must notify the Service Providers prior to the scheduled investment date, which is eighteen (18) hours after your direct deposit paycheck is recognized by Acorns, in order to cancel this authorization. If the Service Providers do not receive notice before the scheduled investment date, the Service Providers may attempt, in their sole discretion, to cancel the debit transaction. However, the Service Providers assume no responsibility for their failure to do so. Please note that withdrawal of your electronic authorization contained in this Section will not apply to ACH transactions performed before the withdrawal of your authorization becomes effective.

In accordance with this Program Agreement, you represent that the transfers you authorize comply with applicable law. The Service Providers reserve the right to delay or prevent transfers of funds in accordance with applicable laws.

         **1.8.3 Termination of Smart Deposit**  
  

You acknowledge that your use of Smart Deposit is voluntary and may be terminated or changed in the Application at any time. Once a direct deposit paycheck has been detected by Acorns as pending, you have eighteen (18) hours to change your Smart Deposit allocation amounts or turn off the feature. To change or terminate your Smart Deposit, visit the Application, navigate to the “Spend” home screen and select “Direct Deposit.” When you are finished making changes and select “Confirm” those changes will be recorded and impact all pending and future direct deposits from that particular employer. 

**Supplement A** 

**Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement**

This Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement (“Supplement”) is part of this Program Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Supplement, defined terms have the same meaning as in this Program Agreement. In the event that any provision in this Supplement conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of this Program Agreement, the provisions of this Supplement will control for matters or services related to this Supplement.

NOTHING IN THIS SUPPLEMENT LIMITS OR WAIVES ANY RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS GOVERNING THE PROVISION OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY OR FIDUCIARY SERVICES TO YOU (INCLUDING AS APPLICABLE THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED, AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED, APPLICABLE TO RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS), OUR OBLIGATION TO ACT IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS WHEN PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO YOU, OR PREVENTS YOU FROM SEEKING RECOURSE FROM ACORNS IN THAT CONNECTION. ACORNS ENCOURAGES YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL CONCERNING THOSE RIGHTS BEFORE ENTERING INTO THIS PROGRAM AGREEMENT AND ANY TIME YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SUCH RIGHTS. 

The terms and conditions of the Program Agreement, including THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION - MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IN SECTION 13 OF THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT, are incorporated into this Supplement between Acorns and you.

A1. Investment Advice

A1.1 Portfolios

Acorns will develop the Portfolios and enhance or update the Portfolios from time to time. You agree that Acorns may modify from time to time the number of Portfolios that it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, to address the investment objectives, time horizons, and risk tolerances associated with categories of clients. You agree that Acorns may, in its sole discretion, modify from time to time the selection of the ETFs that comprise each of the Portfolios and the relative weightings of the ETFs within each of the Portfolios. 

Acorns will use the Application to provide you with information about the composition and investment objectives of the Portfolios. You agree that:

* the Portfolios are subject to the investment risks described in Section 1.6. of the Product Terms section of this Program Agreement;
* any projected returns associated with any Portfolio may not materialize; and
* any hypothetical back-tested returns associated with any Portfolio are based on assumptions and do not reflect actual results of any Portfolio Account.

A1.2 Acorns Invest Suggested Portfolio

Based on your Client Information and responses to an investor questionnaire, Acorns will use a proprietary algorithm that is part of the Portfolio Advice Application to recommend to you a Suggested Portfolio among the Portfolios offered. You acknowledge that Acorns identifies the Suggested Portfolio in reliance on the Client Information you provide. You agree to provide Acorns with Client Information and that the information you provide is true, accurate, complete, and current in accordance with applicable law and Section 6 of this Program Agreement, including the representations, warranties, agreements and indemnification provisions of Section 6 of this Program Agreement. Client Information should be updated when events occur that would make any information provided inaccurate. Acorns is not liable for any identification of a Suggested Portfolio based on untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date Client Information. You agree that you will access and review information identifying and describing the Suggested Portfolio using the Portfolio Advice Application.

You acknowledge that, based on the Client Information you provide and the Investment Advisory methodology used in developing the Portfolio Advice Application, the Suggested Portfolio is the choice among the Portfolios that Acorns recommends as best for you. However, you agree that there is no guarantee, representation, warranty, or covenant that the Suggested Portfolio will perform better over any period than any other Portfolio or any other investment. You agree that:

* the Suggested Portfolio is subject to the investment risks described in Section 1.6 of the Product Terms section of this Program Agreement;
* any projected returns associated with your Suggested Portfolio may not materialize; and
* any hypothetical back-tested returns associated with your Suggested Portfolio are based on assumptions and do not reflect actual results of any Portfolio Account.

A1.2.1 Acorns Early Portfolio

You acknowledge that your Acorns Early Portfolio offers the Aggressive Portfolio only and that there are no other Portfolio selections available. You agree that there is no guarantee, representation, warranty, or covenant that the Acorns Early Portfolio will perform better over any period than any other investment. You agree that:

* the Acorns Early Portfolio is subject to the investment risks described in Section 1.6 of the Product Terms section of this Program Agreement;
* any projected returns associated with the Acorns Early Portfolio may not materialize; and
* any hypothetical back-tested returns associated with your Acorns Early Portfolio are based on assumptions and do not reflect actual results of any Portfolio Account.

A1.3 Selected Portfolio

You may choose any one of the Portfolios to be your Selected Portfolio. You are not obligated to choose the Suggested Portfolio to be your Selected Portfolio. You may change your Selected Portfolio at any time, in the case of Acorns Invest Accounts, using the Application and, in the case of Acorns Later Accounts, by contacting Acorns Customer Service during business hours. There may not be more than one Selected Portfolio for your Portfolio Account. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the choice among the Portfolios of your choice Selected Portfolio. Acorns does not have authority or discretion to select any Portfolio, including the Suggested Portfolio, for you. You further acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review and carefully consider the information available on the Acorns Website or within the Application about each of the Portfolios and their constituent ETFs before choosing your Selected Portfolio.

While the Program is designed so that trading in your Portfolio Account over time causes the holdings to approximate your Selected Portfolio, you agree that there is no guarantee, representation, warranty, or covenant that the holdings in your Portfolio Account will match the allocations of your Selected Portfolio. You acknowledge that various factors (including the timing and frequency of Deposits and Withdrawals, market volatility and disruptions, the timing and frequency of your choice of or changes to your Selected Portfolio, any exclusion of an ETF from your Selected Portfolio, access interruptions, and hardware or software failures) can impact the extent to which holdings in your Portfolio Account will approximate your Selected Portfolio at any particular point in time.

If you choose a Selected Portfolio other than the Suggested Portfolio, you acknowledge and agree, without limiting any other provision of this Program Agreement or this Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement, that:

* you will assume the risk that your Selected Portfolio may perform worse for you over any period than the Suggested Portfolio or any other investment;
* your Selected Portfolio may not be suitable with respect to your investment objectives, risk tolerance, age, or financial condition or other facts or circumstances that apply to you; and
* Acorns is not liable for any losses or other damages resulting from your choice of a Selected Portfolio. 

You acknowledge and agree that:

* the Program (other than a Custom Portfolio, which is self-directed investments in Stock) is designed for investments in ETFs allocated so that the resulting holdings tend to approximate one of the Portfolios over time;
* with respect to a Custom Portfolio, investments over time will approximate the percentages you have set for the Custom Portfolio Account;
* Acorns designed the selection and relative weighting of the ETFs in each of the Portfolios to pursue specific investment objectives, including diversification; and
* removing any ETF from any Portfolio will change the weightings of ETFs in the resulting altered portfolio in a way that deviates from Acorns’ investment advice and may adversely impact performance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may request to exclude from your Selected Portfolio any one of the ETFs that otherwise compose your Selected Portfolio if, after carefully reviewing and analyzing all pertinent information available on the Acorns Website or through the Application about your Selected Portfolio, you conclude that you do not want to own any one of the ETFs in the Selected Portfolio. You may request to exclude from or re-include in your Selected Portfolio an ETF at any time by emailing support@acorns.com. You acknowledge and agree that, due to the relatively small number of ETFs in each of the Portfolios, it would not be reasonable for you to request the exclusion of more than one ETF from any Portfolio. You therefore agree that you do not have the ability to request exclusion of more than one ETF from your Selected Portfolio at any time. If you exclude an ETF from your Selected Portfolio, the remaining ETFs in your Selected Portfolio will be allocated relative to each other in the same proportions that they are allocated relative to each other in the Portfolio on which your selected Portfolio is based. You acknowledge that excluding an ETF from your Selected Portfolio may adversely impact its performance. By excluding an ETF, you acknowledge and agree, without limiting any other provision of this Program Agreement or this Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement, that:

* you will assume the risk that your Selected Portfolio may perform worse for you over any period than the Suggested Portfolio, any other Portfolio on which your Selected Portfolio is based, or any other investment;
* your Selected Portfolio may not be suitable with respect to your investment objectives, risk tolerance, age, or financial condition or other facts or circumstances that apply to you; and
* Acorns is not liable for any losses or other damages resulting from your exclusion of any ETF from your Selected Portfolio.

A1.4 Ongoing Advice to Help Your Holdings Track Selected Portfolio

You authorize Acorns to conduct Rebalancings from time to time in your Portfolio Account (excluding your Custom Portfolio Account, if any). A proprietary algorithm in the Application will calculate the purchases and sales for each Rebalancing based on automated analysis of your Portfolio Account holdings relative to your Selected Portfolio. Acorns will design the Orders for Rebalancing to cause the holdings in your Portfolio Account to approximate your Selected Portfolio more closely after settlement of the purchases and sales that compose the Rebalancing than before settlement of such purchases and sales. You agree that Acorns may modify at any time the manner in which, or the frequency with which, Acorns calculates, generates, and places with Acorns Securities the Orders for Rebalancing. You acknowledge that changes, particularly volatile changes, in the market price of the ETFs in your Selected Portfolio relative to each other may prevent Rebalancings from successfully making your Portfolio Account holdings more closely approximate your Selected Portfolio.

You authorize Acorns to conduct Reinvestments on your behalf after each receipt in your Portfolio Account of a dividend on ETF Shares you own through the Program. Acorns will generally design the Orders for Reinvestments to approximate your Selected Portfolio. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Supplement or elsewhere, you agree that Acorns is under no duty to conduct, and makes no guarantee that it will conduct, any Rebalancing or Reinvestment at any particular time or a purchase or sale for Rebalancing of any ETF Shares in any particular amount.

A1.5 Standard of Care

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Program Agreement and this Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement, Acorns will exercise the level of care in providing the Advisory Services that is customary and reasonable in the industry for investment advisers providing investment advice solely through internet-accessed computer applications, it being understood and agreed that you remain responsible for any investment decisions you make in any Custom Portfolio Account.

Acorns owes its investment advisory clients fiduciary duties that require, among other things, that Acorns act in the best interests of its clients. Services provided to you by Acorns that are not investment advisory services, such as educational content and access to Acorns’ financial wellness system, do not create an investment advisory relationship between you and Acorns, in which case Acorns has no corresponding fiduciary duty with respect to such services.

A1.6 Scope and Delivery of Our Investment Advice

You acknowledge and agree that Acorns will not provide investment advice other than the investment advice described in this Section A1 and will not provide you Advisory Services separate from the Program. You agree that Acorns will provide you investment advice and deliver the Advisory Services solely electronically in accordance with Section 8 of this Program Agreement. You acknowledge that Acorns will not provide you investment advice in person, over the phone, or other than via information available on the Application and Acorns Website and communications through the Portfolio Advice Application. You acknowledge that you will not be entitled or able to transact in or hold securities in your Portfolio Account other than the ETF Shares selected by Acorns to comprise the Portfolios for the Program.

You expressly acknowledge and agree that Acorns Advisers will not provide investment advice on any specific orders you direct in a Custom Portfolio Account or its holdings.

A1.7 Responsibility for Voting of Proxies

You expressly acknowledge and agree that voting proxies for securities in your Portfolio Account or Custom Portfolio Account is your responsibility and that Acorns will not have any obligation to vote, and will not vote, any such proxies. You further acknowledge that you have provided Acorns with your current email address and will update the address promptly should any changes occur.

A1.8 Acorns Early Account Management 

You acknowledge that Acorns will not provide investment advice to the beneficiary of an Acorns Early Account. You acknowledge and agree, as provided under the applicable laws governing UGMA/UTMA, that (i) all investments into a Acorns Early Account (“Custodial Assets”) immediately and irrevocably become property of the beneficiary; (ii) the beneficiary will have complete control over the Custodial Assets when he or she reaches the default age of transfer determined by the beneficiary’s state of residence or on reaching the age of transfer as elected by you, although such elected age must be at least eighteen (18) years old; (iii) you have sole responsibility to manage the Custodial Assets for the beneficiary until custodianship termination; (iv) Custodial Assets must be used for the use and benefit of the beneficiary; (v) Acorns may restrict your access to the Acorns Early Account and register Custodial Assets in the beneficiary’s name on the age of transfer; and (vi) you will provide Acorns, on request and to the extent possible, with the beneficiary’s telephone number, email address, mailing address, and any other information that may assist Acorns in contacting the beneficiary.

You agree that, by requesting a Withdrawal, you authorize Acorns to place an order with Acorns Securities on your behalf for sales of ETF Shares and/or Stocks in your Portfolio Account in amounts calculated by the Portfolio Advice Application such that the resulting holdings in your Portfolio Account after settlement of such sales will approximate your Selected Portfolio.

A3. Limited Trading Authority to Modify and Track Portfolio Accounts 

Generally, you will direct and are responsible for the direction of your investments through the Program by (i) carefully reviewing the information about investing and the Portfolios available on the Acorns Website and through the Application; (ii) carefully considering the recommendations that Acorns generates for you through the Portfolio Advisory Application of the Suggested Portfolio; (iii) choosing your Selected Portfolio; and (iv) deciding whether to exclude an ETF from your Selected Portfolio. Moreover, it is your responsibility to conduct and monitor the inflows and outflows to and from your Portfolio Account by using the Application to initiate Deposits at Will, Round-Ups® Deposits, Real Time Round-Ups® Deposits, and Withdrawals. However, Acorns will have discretion over assets in your Portfolio Account to the limited extent that Acorns has the authority under the Program:

* to determine and modify from time to time which ETFs compose each of the Portfolios, including your Suggested Portfolio and Selected Portfolio;
* to determine when, how often, and in what amounts to conduct Rebalancings in your Portfolio Account;
* to determine the timing of purchases in relation to Deposits; and
* to determine the timing of sales and Withdrawals in relation to requests for Withdrawals.

With respect to a Custom Portfolio Account, you are responsible for directing the purchase and sale activity in the Custom Portfolio Account, which is not managed by Acorns Advisers on a discretionary basis. You agree and understand that Acorns Advisers accepts and routes client-directed orders to Acorns Securities. Acorns Advisers will not provide personalized investment advice in connection with these client-directed investment decisions. Acorns Advisers will make available generalized investment advice and education on key investing concepts for clients enrolled in the Custom Portfolio Accounts, will monitor your Custom Portfolio Account against your other Acorns Portfolio Accounts, and will set limits for the percentage of your overall Acorns Invest Account which may be allocated as an accommodation to your Custom Portfolio Account. 

A5. Brokerage and Custody

Although Acorns may transmit your requests for Withdrawals to the ACH Operator and/or Acorns Securities, Acorns has no authority to initiate any Withdrawal or otherwise to transfer any securities or money out of your Portfolio Account other than for fee deduction pursuant to Section A6.3 of this Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement.

By entering into the Supplements and participating in the Program, you authorize and instruct Acorns to use Acorns Securities to maintain your Portfolio Account and to handle Orders. You acknowledge and agree that Acorns may combine Orders for purchases or sales of Stock in your Custom Portfolio or ETF Shares in your other Portfolio Account with Orders for purchases or sales of Stock in other Custom Portfolios, ETF Shares in other accounts in the Program and/or with purchases or sales of Stocks and ETF Shares by Acorns into larger Orders for aggregate transactions for each applicable Stock or ETF in the Portfolio. You agree that Acorns Securities will route Orders to the Clearing Broker for execution, clearance, and settlement.

Any ACH debit you preauthorize in the preceding sentence will result in an electronic funds transfer from your Funding Source to Acorns to pay, if applicable, the Subscription Fee. Acorns or any of its agents may charge a fee if your ACH debit fails due to insufficient funds in your Funding Source. 

You further authorize Acorns to instruct Acorns Securities to sell, as necessary, securities in your Portfolio Account and Custom Portfolio Account and to transfer money out of one or more of your Portfolio Accounts or your Custom Portfolio Account to pay Acorns or Acorns Securities amounts, if any, of the Subscription Fee and, if any, other fees due under the Supplements. The securities sales you authorize in the preceding sentence include without limitation sales to pay (i) any Subscription Fee if your Funding Source is closed or disconnected from your Portfolio Account or its transactions restricted; (ii) any Subscription Fee if the preauthorized recurring monthly ACH debit you authorized above is rejected in any month due to non-sufficient funds; and (iii) any fees other than the Subscription Fee that may apply to any of your Portfolio Accounts under this Program Agreement.

Acorns will not assign this Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement without your consent; provided, however, that (i) any transaction that does not involve an actual change in management or control of Acorns will not be deemed an assignment; and (ii) you will be deemed to have consented to any assignment if you do not object to such assignment within sixty (60) calendar days of being notified      through the Acorns Website or the Application or by email of any intent of Acorns Advisers to assign this Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement.

This Traditional IRA Custodial Account Supplement (“Supplement”) is part of this Program Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Supplement, defined terms have the same meaning as in this Program Agreement. In the event any provision in this Supplement conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of this Program Agreement, the provisions of this Supplement will control for matters or services related to this Supplement.  

(Under Section 408(A) of the Internal Revenue Code — Form 5305-A (Revised October 2016))

Form 5305-A is a model custodial account agreement that meets the requirements of section 408(a) and has been pre-approved by the IRS. You, the depositor whose name appears in the accompanying application, is establishing an Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) under section 408(a) to provide for your retirement and for the support of your beneficiaries after death. The account must be created in the United States for the exclusive benefit of you, the depositor, or your beneficiaries.

The IRA Custodian and Administrator has given you the disclosure statement required under Regulations section 1.408-6 (attached to this Program Agreement as Supplement C1). You and the IRA Custodian and Administrator make the following agreement:

Article I

Except in the case of a rollover contribution described in section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16), an employer contribution to a simplified employee pension plan as described in section 408(k), or a recharacterized contribution described in section 408A(d)(6), the IRA Custodian and Administrator will accept only cash contributions up to $3,000 per year for tax years 2002 through 2004. That contribution limit is increased to $4,000 for tax years 2005 through 2007 and $5,000 for 2008 and thereafter. If you have reached the age of 50 before the close of the tax year, the contribution limit is increased to $3,500 per year for tax years 2002 through 2004, $4,500 for 2005, $5,000 for 2006 and 2007, and $6,000 for 2008 and thereafter. For tax years after 2008, the above limits will be increased to reflect a cost-of-living adjustment, if any.

Article II

Your interest in the balance in the custodial account is nonforfeitable.

Article III

1\. No part of the custodial funds may be invested in life insurance contracts, nor may the assets of the custodial account be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund (within the meaning of section 408(a)(5)).

2\. No part of the custodial funds may be invested in collectibles (within the meaning of section 408(m)) except as otherwise permitted by section 408(m)(3), which provides an exception for certain gold, silver, and platinum coins, coins issued under the laws of any state, and certain bullion.

Article IV

1\. Notwithstanding any provision of this Supplement to the contrary, the distribution of your interest in the custodial account will be made in accordance with the following requirements and will otherwise comply with section 408(a)(6) and the Regulations thereunder, the provisions of which are herein incorporated by reference.

2\. Your entire interest in the custodial account must be, or begin to be, distributed not later than your required beginning date, April 1 following the calendar year end in which you reach age 70½. By that date, you may elect, in a manner acceptable to the IRA Custodian and Administrator, to have the balance in the custodial account distributed in:

a. a single sum; or

b. payments over a period not longer than your life or the joint lives of you and your designated beneficiary.

3\. If you die before your entire interest is distributed to you, the entire remaining interest will be distributed as follows:

a. if you die on or after the required beginning date and;

i. the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the remaining interest will be distributed over your surviving spouse’s life expectancy as determined each year until such spouse’s death, or over the period in paragraph (a)(3) below if longer. Any interest remaining after the spouse’s death will be distributed over such spouse’s remaining life expectancy as determined in the year of the spouse’s death and reduced by 1 for each subsequent year, or, if distributions are being made over the period in paragraph (a)(3) below, over such period.

ii. the designated beneficiary is not your surviving spouse, the remaining interest will be distributed over the beneficiary’s remaining life expectancy as determined in the year following your death and reduced by 1 for each subsequent year, or over the period in paragraph (a)(3) below if longer.

iii. there is no designated beneficiary, the remaining interest will be distributed over your remaining life expectancy as determined in the year of your death and reduced by 1 for each subsequent year.

b. if you die before the required beginning date, the entire remaining interest will be distributed in accordance with (1) below or, if elected or there is no designated beneficiary, in accordance with (2) below:

i. the remaining interest will be distributed in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) above (but not over the period in paragraph (a)(3), even if longer), starting by the end of the calendar year following the year of your death. If, however, your designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, then this distribution is not required to begin before the end of the calendar year in which you would have reached age 70½. But, in such case, if your surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin, then the remaining interest will be distributed in accordance with (a)(2) above (but not over the period in paragraph (a)(3), even if longer), over such spouse’s designated beneficiary’s life expectancy, or in accordance with (2) below if there is no such designated beneficiary.

ii. the remaining interest will be distributed by the end of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of your death.

4\. If you die before your entire interest has been distributed and if your designated beneficiary is not your surviving spouse, no additional contributions may be accepted in the account.

5\. The minimum amount that must be distributed each year, beginning with the year containing your required beginning date, is known as the “required minimum distribution” and is determined as follows:

a. The required minimum distribution under paragraph 4.02(b) for any year, beginning with the year you reach age 70½, is your account value at the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year divided by the distribution period in the uniform lifetime table in Regulations section 1.401(a)(9)-9.

However, if your designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the required minimum distribution for a year will not be more than your account value at the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year divided by the number in the joint and last survivor table in Regulations section 1.401(a) (9)-9. The required minimum distribution for a year under this paragraph (a) is determined using your (or, if applicable, you and your spouse’s) attained age (or ages) in the year.

b. The required minimum distribution under paragraphs 4.03(a) and 4.03(b)(1) for a year, beginning with the year following the year of your death (or the year you would have reached age 70½, if applicable under paragraph 4.03(b)(1)) is the account value at the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year divided by the life expectancy (in the single life table in Regulations section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the individual specified in such paragraphs 4.03(a) and 4.03(b)(1)).

c. The required minimum distribution for the year you reach age 70½ can be made as late as April 1 of the following year. The required minimum distribution for any other year must be made by the end of such year.

6\. If you own two (2) or more traditional IRAs, you may satisfy the minimum distribution requirements described above by taking from one traditional IRA the amount required to satisfy the requirement for another in accordance with Regulations section 408(a)(6).

Article V

1\. You agree to provide the IRA Custodian and Administrator with all information necessary to prepare any reports required by section 408(i) and Regulations sections 1.408-5 and 1.408-6.

2\. The IRA Custodian and Administrator agrees to submit to the Internal Revenue Service and you the reports prescribed by the IRS.

Article VI

Notwithstanding any other articles which may be added or incorporated, the provisions of Articles I through III and this sentence will be controlling. Any additional articles that are not consistent with section 408(a) and the related Regulations will be invalid.

Article VII

This Supplement will be amended as necessary to comply with the provisions of the Code (as defined below) and related Regulations. Other amendments may be made with the consent of the persons whose signatures appear on the application.

You understand that we do not make any representation or warranty that any rollover contribution will be excludable from income for federal or state income tax purposes.

b. Custodial Account — We will maintain a custodial account for your benefit. The custodial account will consist of all investments purchased at your direction. All assets in the custodial account will be registered in our name as custodian or in the name of our nominee. We may, by or through a broker, or other such firm, hold any securities in bearer form or deposit them with a central clearing corporation or depository approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided that our records show that all such investments are part of the custodial account.

c. Custodian’s Reservation of Rights — Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VIII, we reserve the right to refuse to follow any investment direction by you which we determine violates any applicable law.

4\. Service Fees: We have the right to charge a fee of up to $25 to manually process an incoming transfer or rollover transaction. In addition, we have the right to be reimbursed or reserve funds for all reasonable expenses we incur in connection with the administration of the traditional IRA.

5\. Your Investment Powers and Our Custodial Duties/Obligations:

a. Investment of Traditional IRA — Subject to Section 8.05(f), you and/or your authorized agent have sole authority and discretion, fully and completely, to select and to direct the investment of all assets in the traditional IRA. You accept full and sole responsibility for the success or failure of any selection made. We have no discretion to direct any investment in the traditional IRA. We will not act as investment advisor or counselor to you and will not advise you or offer any opinion or judgment on any matter pertaining to the nature, value, potential value or suitability of any investment or potential investment of the assets of the traditional IRA, and are merely authorized to acquire and hold the particular investments specified by you. We have no responsibility nor any liability for any loss of income or of capital, nor for any unusual expense which we may incur, relating to any investment, or to the sale or exchange of any asset which you or your authorized agent directs us to make.

After your death, your beneficiary(ies) will have the right to direct the investment of the traditional IRA assets, subject to the same conditions that applied to you during your lifetime under this Supplement (including, without limitations, Section 8.03 and 8.05). All transactions are subject to any and all applicable laws, including the rules, regulations, customs and usages of any exchange, market or clearing house where the transaction is executed and to our policies and practices.

b. Limitation of Investment Powers — We, as custodian of the traditional IRA assets entrusted to us under the traditional IRA, will not commingle the traditional IRA with any other property we hold except in a common trust fund or common investment fund. We retain the power to take such actions as are reasonable and necessary to carry out our duties under the traditional IRA. We are under no duty to take any action other than as specified under this Supplement unless you provide us with instructions and agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of such instructions. Subject to the rules imposed by us, and subject to investment directions given by you or your authorized agent, we are authorized and empowered, but not by way of limitation, with the following powers, rights and duties:

i. to hold or invest any part or all of the traditional IRA in any asset permissible under law as an investment for an individual retirement account;

ii. to manage, sell, contract to sell, grant options to purchase, convey, petition, divide, subdivide, exchange, transfer, abandon, improve, repair, insure, lease for any term even though commencing in the future or extending beyond the term of the traditional IRA, and otherwise deal with all property, real or personal, in such manner for such considerations and on such terms and conditions as are in accordance with the written direction we receive;

iii. to retain in cash so much of the traditional IRA as you or your authorized agent directs;

iv. to transfer all or any part of the traditional IRA funds from one type of savings instrument offered by us to another type of savings instrument offered by us, to the extent permitted by the applicable governmental regulations and our procedures; and

v. to make, execute and deliver as custodian contracts, waivers, releases or other written instruments necessary to exercise the powers enumerated above.

c. Custodian’s Powers — We will have the power or duty:

i. to hold any securities or other property in the traditional IRA in the name of the custodian or its nominee, or in another form as we may deem best, with or without disclosing the custodial relationship;

ii. to retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without liability for the payment of interest and to decline to make payment or delivery of the funds or property until a court of competent jurisdiction makes final adjudication;

iii. to charge against and pay from the traditional IRA all taxes of any nature levied, assessed, or imposed on the traditional IRA, and to pay all reasonable expenses and attorney fees which may be necessarily incurred by us with respect to the traditional IRA;

iv. to file any tax or information return required of us, and to pay any tax, interest or penalty associated with any such tax return;

v. to act pursuant to written blanket settlement authorization given by you on transactions executed by your designated agent. We are authorized to honor all trade confirmations received from such agent;

vi. to furnish or cause to be furnished to you an annual calendar year report concerning the status of the traditional IRA, including a statement of the assets of the traditional IRA held at the end of the calendar year;

vii. to begin, maintain or defend any litigation necessary in connection with the administration of the traditional IRA, except that we will not be obliged or required to do so unless indemnified to our satisfaction, including, without limitation, payment of such expenses out of traditional IRA assets; and

viii. to charge you separately a fee of up to $25 to manually process an incoming transfer or rollover transaction, and deduct the amount of such fee from the assets in the traditional IRA at our discretion. We are also entitled to be reimbursed for any taxes and other expenses we assume or incur on behalf of your account. Our right to compensation and reimbursement from the account will constitute a first prior lien against your account. We have the right to change our fee on thirty (30) days’ notice to you. We are authorized to liquidate assets of the traditional IRA for any unpaid fee balance and can, at our discretion, require you to retain uninvested cash in the traditional IRA in an amount not less than one year’s annual fees and termination fees and not more than $1,000. The choice of the selling broker and assets to be sold will be at our sole discretion. Should fees or expenses not be collected, we will have the option to cease performing any functions, including, but not limited to, processing investment transactions until such time as all fees and expenses charged against the account are fully paid.

The IRA Custodian and Administrator may receive compensation from a depository bank for necessary administrative services as part of the establishment of and maintenance of the custodial cash account including, but not limited to sub-accounting services, depository institution selection, record-keeping and transaction processing. This compensation may be paid separately by the depository institution or be deducted from the interest earned on the account. However, you will receive a rate of interest that will be set by the IRA Custodian and Administrator’s board of directors at least annually consistent with rates being offered by one or more depository institutions for similar accounts. The IRA Custodian and Administrator, at its discretion, may place deposits with one or more depository banks. All of these depository bank accounts will be FDIC insured up to the maximum allowed under applicable law.

In addition, the IRA Custodian and Administrator may receive commissions, 12(b)1 fees, sub-transfer agent fees, marketing fees and other types of compensation from various entities relating to investments held in the traditional IRA.

d. Publicly-Traded Securities — If publicly-traded securities are to be included in the specified investments, orders will be executed through a securities broker/dealer registered under the Exchange Act designated by IRA Services Trust Company (“ISTC”). Any brokerage account maintained in connection herewith will be in our name as the custodian of your account. We will be authorized to honor transactions within the brokerage account without obligation to verify prior authorization of same by you. Any cash received by the brokerage account, whether as income or proceeds of transactions, may be held by the brokerage account pending directions, and we will have no obligation to direct the broker to remit such cash until directed to do so by you, but may receive remittances without direction if the same are made by the broker. Investments outside the brokerage account will be made in accordance with the other provisions of this Article.

e. Investment directions may be given by Acorns Advisers directly to your designated broker (in such manner as the broker may require) and the broker will be responsible for the execution of such orders.

f. Delegation of Investment Responsibility — You have delegated investment responsibility for the traditional IRA to Acorns Advisers. Acorns Advisers will be your authorized agent, and not ours. We will construe any and all investment directions given by Acorns Advisers, whether written or oral, as having been authorized by you. We will follow the proper written direction of Acorns Advisers and we will be under no duty to review or question, nor will we be responsible for, any of that party’s directions, actions or failures to act. Acorns Advisers’ instructions to us will be deemed to be instructions by you for all purposes of this Article VIII.

g. Broker — Acorns Advisers as authorized agent has been delegated authority to appoint Acorns Securities as Broker. Acorns Advisers has the sole responsibility for determining whether the Broker is qualified to act in that capacity. We will assume that the Broker appointed is at all times qualified to act. We will further assume that the Broker possesses the authority to act in that capacity until such time as another Broker has been appointed.

The Broker will be responsible for the execution of securities orders. The Broker may require that you sign an agreement which sets forth, among other things, its responsibilities and your responsibilities regarding securities transactions for the traditional IRA.

h. Authorization — On a form or in a format acceptable to us, you may authorize us to accept written, verbal, fax, e-mail and other means of communication for investment directions from you or your designated representative. You agree that we are not responsible for verifying the propriety of any investment direction and that we are not responsible for unauthorized trades in your account that may be affected under this Section.

i. Valuation of Assets — We will value assets of the account on a periodic basis utilizing various outside sources. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of such prices obtained from quotation services, independent appraisal services, investment sponsors, or parties related thereto or other outside sources. Values for brokerage accounts will be equal to the total equity value of the account and will reflect only those assets that are priced by the brokerage firm. Individual assets held within your brokerage account may not be listed individually on our statements. Such information can be obtained directly from your brokerage statement.

We will have no duty or responsibility to value illiquid assets such as promissory notes, real estate, privately held stocks, etc. These assets will be valued at cost (original purchase price) unless you provide us with documentation, in a form and from a source acceptable to us, which provides an alternative value. With respect to limited partnerships and limited liability companies, we may solicit a value directly from the investment sponsor or other outside source. If the investment sponsor is unwilling or unable to provide a fair market value, then we may list the value of the asset at its original cost or as “not available”.

Assets which have no readily determinable market value, are bankrupt, or for which no original cost or value is otherwise available may have their value reflected as “not available” on our statements. Should we be required to provide such information for illiquid assets we may obtain suitable and independent advisors. The costs of the independent valuation will be at the expense of the traditional IRA.

j. Unrelated Business Taxable Income — Certain investments may generate taxable income within the traditional IRA account. This is referred to as Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI). Such income must be considered in conjunction with all such income from all the traditional IRA accounts and may be taxable to your account(s) to the extent that all UBTI for a given taxable year exceeds the threshold amount set by the IRS (currently $1000). In such instances, the IRS requires that a Form 990-T be filed for the traditional IRA account along with the appropriate amount of tax. We do not monitor the amount of UBTI in the traditional IRA account with us and do not prepare Form 990-T. Therefore, you must monitor UBTI for this and any other traditional IRA account which you may hold and prepare, or have prepared, the proper 990-T tax form and forward it to us for filing, along with authorization to pay any tax due from the traditional IRA account.

k. Life Insurance and Collectible — You may not direct the purchase of a life insurance contract or a “collectible” as defined in Code Section 4011(m).

6\. Beneficiary(ies): If you die before you receive all of the amounts in your traditional IRA, payments from your traditional IRA will be made to your beneficiary(ies).

You may designate one or more persons as beneficiary of your traditional IRA. This designation can only be made on a form provided by or acceptable to us, and it will only be effective when it is filed with us during your lifetime or after as provided under applicable law. Unless otherwise specified, each beneficiary designation you file with us will cancel all previous ones. The consent of a beneficiary(ies) will not be required for you to revoke a beneficiary designation. If you have designated both primary and contingent beneficiaries and no primary beneficiary(ies) survives you, the contingent beneficiary(ies) will acquire the designated share of your traditional IRA. If you do not designate a beneficiary, or if all of your primary and contingent beneficiary(ies) predecease you, your estate will be the beneficiary.

A spouse beneficiary will have all rights as granted under the Code or applicable Regulations to treat your IRA as his or her own.

We may allow, if permitted by state law, an original IRA beneficiary(ies) (the beneficiary(ies) who is entitled to receive distribution(s) from an inherited IRA at the time of your death) to name a successor beneficiary(ies) for the inherited IRA. This designation can only be made on a form provided by or acceptable to us, and it will only be effective when it is filed with us during the original IRA beneficiary’s(ies’) lifetime or after as provided under applicable law. Unless otherwise specified, each beneficiary designation form that the original IRA beneficiary(ies) files with us will cancel all previous ones. The consent of a successor beneficiary(ies) will not be required for the original IRA beneficiary(ies) to revoke a successor beneficiary(ies) designation. If the original IRA beneficiary(ies) does not designate a successor beneficiary(ies), his or her estate will be the successor beneficiary. In no event will the successor beneficiary(ies) be able to extend the distribution period beyond that required for the original IRA beneficiary.

7\. Termination: Either party may terminate this Supplement at any time by giving written notice to the other. We can resign as custodian at any time effective thirty (30) days after we mail written notice of our resignation to you. On receipt of that notice, you must make arrangements to transfer the traditional IRA to another financial organization. If you do not complete a transfer of the traditional IRA within thirty (30) days from the date we mail the notice to you, we have the right to transfer the traditional IRA assets to a successor traditional IRA custodian or trustee that we choose in our sole discretion or we may pay the traditional IRA to you in a single sum. We will not be liable for any actions or failures to act on the part of the successor custodian or trustee nor for tax consequences you may incur that result from the transfer or distribution of the traditional IRA assets pursuant to this section.

If this Supplement is terminated, we may hold back from the traditional IRA a reasonable amount of money which we believe is necessary to cover any one or more of the following:

a. any fees, expenses or taxes chargeable against the traditional IRA;

b. any penalties associated with the early withdrawal of any savings instrument or other investment in the traditional IRA.

If our organization is merged with another organization (or comes under the control of any federal or state agency) or if our entire organization (or any portion which includes the traditional IRA) is bought by another organization, that organization (or agency) will automatically become the trustee or custodian of the traditional IRA, but only if it is the type of organization authorized to serve as a traditional IRA trustee or custodian.

If we are required to comply with Section 1.408-2(e) of the Regulations and we fail to do so, or we are not keeping the records, making the returns or sending the statements as are required by forms or Regulations, the IRS may, after notifying you, require that a substitute trustee or custodian be appointed.

8\. Amendments: We have the right to amend this Supplement at any time and charge a fee for IRS mandated amendments. Any amendment we make to comply with the Code and related Regulations does not require your consent. You will be deemed to have consented to any other amendment unless, within thirty (30) days from the date we mail the amendment, you notify us in writing that you do not consent.

9\. Withdrawals: All requests for withdrawal will be in writing on a form provided by or acceptable to us. The method of distribution must be specified in writing. The tax identification number of the recipient must be provided to us before we are obligated to make a distribution.

10\. Required Minimum Distributions: You may make an election to begin receiving payments from your IRA in a manner that satisfies the required minimum distribution rules no later than April 1st of the year following the year you reach age 70½ (this is called the “required beginning date”). If you fail to make such an election by your required beginning date, we can, at our complete and sole discretion, do any one of the following:

a. make no payment until you give us a proper payment request;

b. pay your entire IRA to you in a single sum payment or distribution in kind; or

c. calculate your required minimum distribution each year for your IRA based on an IRS approved method and pay those distributions to you until you direct otherwise. We will not be liable for any penalties or taxes related to your failure to take a distribution.

11\. Transfers from Other Plans: We can receive amounts transferred to the traditional IRA from the custodian or trustee of another traditional IRA. We reserve the right not to accept any transfer or rollover.

12\. Liquidation of Assets: We have the right to liquidate assets in the traditional IRA if necessary to make distributions or to pay fees, expenses or taxes properly chargeable against the traditional IRA. If you fail to direct us as to which assets to liquidate, we will decide in our complete and sole discretion and you agree not to hold us liable for any adverse consequences that result from our decision.

Restrictions on the Fund: Neither you nor any beneficiary may sell, transfer or pledge any interest in the traditional IRA in any manner whatsoever, except as provided under applicable law or this Supplement. The assets in the traditional IRA will not be responsible for the debts, contracts or torts of any person entitled to distributions under this Supplement.

13\. What Law Applies: This Supplement is subject to applicable law. If it is necessary to apply any State law to interpret and administer this Supplement, the law of the state of South Dakota will govern.

If any part of this Supplement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the remaining parts will not be affected. Neither your nor our failure to enforce at any time or for any period of time any provision of this Supplement will be construed as a waiver of such provisions, or the parties’ right thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. These rights and liabilities are continuous, covering individually and collectively, all accounts you may open with us or our agent for the same traditional IRA, and inure to the benefit of us, our successors or assigns and are binding on you and your heirs, successors or assigns.

14\. Indemnity of IRA Custodian and Administrator: To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) harmless against and from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), arising in connection with this Supplement, with respect to (A) any negligence or alleged negligence, whether passive or active, by the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including its officers, agents and employees), (B) any breach or alleged breach, whether passive or active, by the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) of any responsibilities under this Supplement, or (C) any breach or alleged breach, whether passive or active, by a third party of responsibilities under this Supplement. You further agree to pay for the defense of the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator, (including their officers, agents and employees) by independent counsel of the IRA Custodian and Administrator’s choice against any such claims, demands, liabilities or costs referred to in the preceding sentence.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) harmless against and from any and all payments or assessments which may result from holding any publicly-traded security or alternative investment within the traditional IRA account, and further agree that the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) will be under no obligation whatsoever to extend credit or otherwise disburse payment beyond the cash balance of your account for any payment or assessment related to such investment(s).

15\. Adverse Claims: If we receive any claim to the assets held in the traditional IRA which is adverse to your interest or the interest of your beneficiary, and we in our absolute discretion decide that the claim is, or may be, meritorious, we may withhold distribution until the claim is resolved or until instructed by a court of competent jurisdiction. As an alternative, we may deposit all or any portion of the assets in the traditional IRA into the court through a motion of interpleader. Deposit with the court will relieve us of any further obligation with respect to the assets deposited. We have the right to be reimbursed from the funds deposited for our legal fees and costs incurred.

16\. Fund Not Guaranteed: We do not guarantee the fund (the traditional IRA account) from loss or depreciation. Our liability to make payment to you at any time and all times is limited to the available assets of the fund.

17\. Arbitration Claims: Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Supplement or the breach thereof, or to the traditional IRA or any transactions authorized by you and/ or your agent, will be determined by binding arbitration as described in section 13 of this Program Agreement. The parties are waiving their right to seek remedies in court, including the right to jury trial. The pre-arbitration discovery is generally more limited than and different from court proceedings.

18\. Attorneys’ Fees:

a. If either party to this Supplement commences any legal action, suit, counterclaim, appeal, arbitration, or other proceeding (an “Action”) against the other party to this Supplement to enforce or interpret any term of this Supplement, because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any terms of this Supplement, or because of a claim arising out of the terms of this Supplement, the losing or defaulting party will pay to the prevailing party reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of such Action.

b. If the prevailing party will obtain a judgment in its favor arising out of any Action against the other party to this Supplement, the party against whom such judgment is rendered will pay to the prevailing party the attorneys’ fees incurred by the prevailing party in the collection or enforcement of such judgment. The provisions of this paragraph (b) will be severable from the other provisions of this Supplement, will survive any judgment, and will not be deemed merged into such judgment.

**Supplement E**

**Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement**

This Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement (“Supplement”) is part of this Program Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Supplement, defined terms have the same meaning as in this Program Agreement. In the event any provision in this Supplement conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of this Program Agreement, the provisions of this Supplement will control for matters or services related to this Supplement. 

(Under Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code — Form 5305-RA (Revised October 2016))

Form 5305-RA is a model custodial account agreement that meets the requirements of section 408A and has been pre-approved by the IRS. You, the depositor whose name appears in the accompanying application is establishing a Roth Individual Retirement Account (“Roth IRA”) under section 408A to provide for your retirement and for the support of your beneficiaries after death. The account must be created in the United States for the exclusive benefit of you, the depositor, or your beneficiaries.

The IRA Custodian and Administrator has given you the disclosure statement required under Regulations section 1.408-6 (attached to this Program Agreement as Supplement F). You and the IRA Custodian and Administrator make the following agreement:

Article I

Except in the case of a rollover contribution described in section 408A(e), a recharacterized contribution described in section 408A(d)(6), or an IRA Conversion Contribution, the IRA Custodian and Administrator will accept only cash contributions up to $3,000 per year for tax years 2002 through 2004. That contribution limit is increased to $4,000 for tax years 2005 through 2007 and $5,000 for 2008 and thereafter. If you have reached the age of 50 before the close of the tax year, the contribution limit is increased to $3,500 per year for tax years 2002 through 2004, $4,500 for 2005, $5,000 for 2006 and 2007, and $6,000 for 2008 and thereafter. For tax years after 2008, the above limits will be increased to reflect a cost-of-living adjustment, if any.

Article II

1\. The annual contribution limit described in Article I is gradually reduced to $0 for higher income levels. For a single depositor, the annual contribution is phased out between adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000 and $135,000; for a married depositor filing jointly, between AGI of $189,000 and $199,000; and for a married depositor filing separately, between $0 and $10,000. In the case of a conversion, the IRA Custodian and Administrator will not accept IRA Conversion Contributions in a tax year if the depositor’s AGI for the tax year the funds were distributed from the other IRA exceeds $100,000 or if the depositor is married and files a separate return. Adjusted gross income is defined in section 408A(c)(3) and does not include IRA Conversion Contributions.

2\. In the case of a joint return, the AGI limits in the preceding paragraph apply to the combined AGI of you and your spouse.

Article III

Your interest in the balance in the custodial account is nonforfeitable.

Article IV

1\. No part of the custodial funds may be invested in life insurance contracts, nor may the assets of the custodial account be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund (within the meaning of section 408(a)(5)).

2\. No part of the custodial funds may be invested in collectibles (within the meaning of section 408(m)) except as otherwise permitted by section 408(m)(3), which provides an exception for certain gold, silver, and platinum coins, coins issued under the laws of any state, and certain bullion.

Article V

1\. If you die before your entire interest is distributed to you and your surviving spouse is not the designated beneficiary, the entire remaining interest will be distributed in accordance with (a) below or, if elected or there is no designated beneficiary, in accordance with (b) below:

a. the remaining interest will be distributed, starting by end of the calendar year following the year of your death, over your designated beneficiary’s remaining life expectancy as determined in the year following your death;

b. the remaining interest will be distributed by the end of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of your death.

2\. The minimum amount that must be distributed each year under paragraph 1(a) above is the account value at the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year divided by the life expectancy (in the single life table in Regulations section 1.401(a)(9)-9) of your designated beneficiary using the attained age of the beneficiary in the year following the year of your death and subtracting 1 from the divisor for each subsequent year.

3\. If your surviving spouse is the designated beneficiary, such spouse will then be treated as the depositor.

Article VI

1\. You agree to provide the IRA Custodian and Administrator with all information necessary to prepare any reports required under sections 408(i) and 408A(d)(3)(E), Regulations sections 1.408-5 and 1.408-6, and under guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

2\. The IRA Custodian and Administrator agrees to submit to the IRS and you the reports prescribed by the IRS.

Article VII

Notwithstanding any other articles which may be added or incorporated, the provisions of Articles 1 through IV and this sentence will be controlling. Any additional articles inconsistent with section 408A, the related Regulations, and other published guidance will be invalid.

Article VIII

This Supplement will be amended from time to time to comply with the provisions of the Code, related Regulations, and other published guidance. Other amendments may be made with the consent of you and the IRA Custodian and Administrator.

Article IX

1\. Definitions: In this part of this Supplement (Article IX), the words “you” and “your” mean you, the depositor, the words “we,” “us” and “our” mean the IRA Custodian and Administrator (including its subsidiaries, and/or agents), “Supplement” means this Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement, “Code” means the Internal Revenue Code, and “Regulations” means the Treasury Regulations.

b. Custodial Account — We will maintain a custodial account for your benefit. The custodial account will consist of all investments purchased at your direction. All assets in the custodial account will be registered in our name as custodian or in the name of our nominee. We may, by or through a broker, or other such firm, hold any securities in bearer form or deposit them with a central clearing corporation or depository approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided that our records show that all such investments are part of the custodial account.

c. Custodian’s Reservation of Rights — Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX, we reserve the right to refuse to follow any investment direction by you which we determine violates applicable law.

4\. Service Fees: We have the right to charge a fee of up to $25 to manually process an incoming transfer or rollover transaction. In addition, we have the right to be reimbursed or reserve funds for all reasonable expenses we incur in connection with the administration of the Roth IRA.

5\. Your Investment Powers and Our Custodial Duties/Obligations:

a. Investment of Roth IRA — Subject to Section 9.05(f), you and/or your authorized agent have sole authority and discretion, fully and completely, to select and to direct the investment of all assets in the Roth IRA. You accept full and sole responsibility for the success or failure of any selection made. We will have no discretion to direct any investment in the Roth IRA. We will not act as investment advisor or counselor to you and will not advise you or offer any opinion or judgment on any matter pertaining to the nature, value, potential value or suitability of any investment or potential investment of the assets of the Roth IRA and are merely authorized to acquire and hold the particular investments specified by you.

After your death, your beneficiary(ies) will have the right to direct the investment of the Roth IRA assets, subject to the same conditions that applied to you during your lifetime under this Supplement (including, without limitations, Section 9.03 and 9.05). All transactions will be subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and the rules, regulations, customs and usages of any exchange, market or clearing house where the transaction is executed and to our policies and practices.

b. Limitation of Investment Powers — We, as custodian of the Roth IRA assets entrusted to us under the Roth IRA, will not commingle the Roth IRA with any other property we hold except in a common trust fund or common investment fund. We retain the power to take such actions as are reasonable and necessary to carry out our duties under the Roth IRA. We are under no duty to take any action other than as specified under this Supplement unless you provide us with instructions and agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of such instructions. Subject to the rules imposed by us, and subject to investment directions given by you or your authorized agent, we are authorized and empowered, but not by way of limitation, with the following powers, rights and duties:

i. to hold or invest any part or all of the Roth IRA in any asset permissible under law as an investment for an individual retirement account;

ii. to manage, sell, contract to sell, grant options to purchase, convey, petition, divide, subdivide, exchange, transfer, abandon, improve, repair, insure, lease for any term even though commencing in the future or extending beyond the term of the Roth IRA, and otherwise deal with all property, real or personal, in such manner for such considerations and on such terms and conditions as are in accordance with the written direction we receive;

iii. to retain in cash so much of the Roth IRA as you or your authorized agent directs;

iv. to transfer all or any part of the Roth IRA funds from one type of savings instrument offered by us to another type of savings instrument offered by us, to the extent permitted by the applicable governmental regulations and our procedures; and

v. to make, execute and deliver as custodian contracts, waivers, releases or other written instruments necessary to exercise the powers enumerated above.

c. Custodian’s Powers — We will have the power or duty:

i. to hold any securities or other property in the Roth IRA in the name of the IRA Custodian and Administrator or its nominee, or in another form as we may deem best, with or without disclosing the custodial relationship;

ii. to retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without liability for the payment of interest and to decline to make payment or delivery of the funds or property until a court of competent jurisdiction makes final adjudication;

iii. to charge against and pay from the Roth IRA all taxes of any nature levied, assessed, or imposed on the Roth IRA, and to pay all reasonable expenses and attorney fees which may be necessarily incurred by us with respect to the Roth IRA;

iv. to file any tax or information return required of us, and to pay any tax, interest or penalty associated with any such tax return;

v. to act pursuant to written blanket settlement authorization given by you on transactions executed by your designated agent. We are authorized to honor all trade confirmations received from such agent;

vi. to furnish or cause to be furnished to you an annual calendar year report concerning the status of the Roth IRA, including a statement of the assets of the Roth IRA held at the end of the calendar year;

vii. to begin, maintain or defend any litigation necessary in connection with the administration of the Roth IRA, except that we will not be obliged or required to do so unless indemnified to our satisfaction, including, without limitation, payment of such expenses out of Roth IRA assets; and

viii. to charge you separately a fee of up to $25 to manually process an incoming transfer or rollover transaction, and deduct the amount of such fee from the assets in the Roth IRA at our discretion. We are also entitled to be reimbursed for any taxes and other expenses we assume or incur on behalf of your account. Our right to compensation and reimbursement from the account will constitute a first prior lien against your account. We have the right to change our fee on thirty (30) days’ notice to you. We are authorized to liquidate assets of the Roth IRA for any unpaid fee balance and can, at our discretion, require you to retain uninvested cash in the Roth IRA in an amount not less than one year’s annual fees plus termination fees and not more than $1,000. The choice of the selling broker and assets to be sold will be at our sole discretion. Should fees or expenses not be collected, we will have the option to cease performing any functions, including, but not limited to, processing investment transactions until such time as all fees and expenses charged against the account are fully paid.

The IRA Custodian and Administrator may receive compensation from a depository bank for necessary administrative services as part of the establishment of and maintenance of the custodial cash account including, but not limited to sub-accounting services, depository institution selection, record-keeping and transaction processing. This compensation may be paid separately by the depository institution or be deducted from the interest earned on the account. However, the Depositor will receive a rate of interest that will be set by the IRA Custodian and Administrator’s board of directors at least annually consistent with rates being offered by one or more depository institutions for similar accounts. The IRA Custodian and Administrator, at its discretion, may place deposits with one or more depository banks. All of these depository bank accounts will be FDIC insured up to the maximum allowed under applicable law.

In addition, the IRA Custodian and Administrator may receive commissions, 12(b)1 fees, sub-transfer agent fees, marketing fees and other types of compensation from various entities relating to investments held in the traditional IRA.

d. Publicly-Traded Securities — If publicly-traded securities are to be included in the specified investments, orders will be executed through a securities broker/dealer registered under the Exchange Act designated by ISTC. Any brokerage account maintained in connection herewith will be in our name as the custodian of your account. We will be authorized to honor transactions within the brokerage account without obligation to verify prior authorization of same by you. Any cash received by the brokerage account, whether as income or proceeds of transactions, may be held by the brokerage account pending directions, and we will have no obligation to direct the broker to remit such cash until directed to do so by you, but may receive remittances without direction if the same are made by the broker. Investments outside the brokerage account will be made in accordance with the other provisions of this Article.

e. Investment directions may be given by Acorns Advisers directly to your designated broker (in such manner as the broker may require) and the broker will be responsible for the execution of such orders. Delegation of Investment Responsibility— You have delegated investment responsibility for the Roth IRA to Acorns Advisers. Acorns Advisers will be your authorized agent, and not ours. We will construe any and all investment directions given by such person, whether written or oral, as having been authorized by you. We will follow the proper written direction of Acorns Advisers and we will be under no duty to review or question, nor will we be responsible for, any of that party’s directions, actions or failures to act. Acorns Advisers’ instructions to us will be deemed to be instructions by you for all purposes of this Article IX.

f. Broker — Acorns Advisers as authorized agent has been delegated authority to appoint Acorns Securities as Broker. Acorns Advisers has the sole responsibility for determining whether the Broker is qualified to act in that capacity. We will assume that the Broker appointed is at all times qualified to act. We will further assume that the Broker possesses the authority to act in that capacity until such time as another Broker has been appointed.

The Broker will be responsible for the execution of securities orders. The Broker may require that you sign an agreement which sets forth, among other things, its responsibilities and your responsibilities regarding securities transactions for the Roth IRA.

g. Authorization — On a form or in a format acceptable to us, you may authorize us to accept written, verbal, fax, e-mail and other means of communication for investment directions from you or your designated representative. You agree that we are not responsible for verifying the propriety of any investment direction and that we are not responsible for unauthorized trades in your account that may be affected under this Section.

h. Valuation of Assets — We will value assets of the account on a periodic basis utilizing various outside sources. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of such prices obtained from quotation services, independent appraisal services, investment sponsors, or parties related thereto or other outside sources. Values for brokerage accounts will be equal to the total equity value of the account and will reflect only those assets that are priced by the brokerage firm. Individual assets held within your brokerage account may not be listed individually on our statements. Such information can be obtained directly from your brokerage statement.

We will have no duty or responsibility to value illiquid assets such as promissory notes, real estate, privately held stocks, etc. These assets will be valued at cost (original purchase price) unless you provide us with documentation, in a form and from a source acceptable to us, which provides an alternative value. With respect to limited partnerships and limited liability companies, we may solicit a value directly from the investment sponsor or other outside source. If the investment sponsor is unwilling or unable to provide a fair market value, then we may list the value of the asset at its original cost or as “not available”.

Assets which have no readily determinable market value, are bankrupt, or for which no original cost or value is otherwise available may have their value reflected as “not available” on our statements. Should we be required to provide such information for illiquid assets we may obtain suitable and independent advisors. The costs of the independent valuation will be at the expense of the Roth IRA.

i. Unrelated Business Taxable Income — Certain investments may generate taxable income within the Roth IRA account. This is referred to as Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI). Such income must be considered in conjunction with all such income from all the Roth IRA accounts and may be taxable to your account(s) to the extent that all UBTI for a given taxable year exceeds the threshold amount set by the IRS (currently $1000). In such instances, the IRS requires that a Form 990-T be filed for the Roth IRA account along with the appropriate amount of tax. We do not monitor the amount of UBTI in the Roth IRA account with us and do not prepare Form 990-T. Therefore, you must monitor UBTI for this and any other Roth IRA account which you may hold and prepare, or have prepared, the proper 990-T tax form and forward it to us for filing, along with authorization to pay any tax due from the Roth IRA account.

j. Life Insurance and Collectible — You may not direct the purchase of a life insurance contract or a “collectible” as defined in Code Section 4011(m).

6\. Beneficiary(ies): If you die before you receive all of the amounts in your Roth IRA, payments from your Roth IRA will be made to your beneficiary(ies).

You may designate one or more persons as beneficiary of your Roth IRA. This designation can only be made on a form provided by or acceptable to us, and it will only be effective when it is filed with us during your lifetime or after as provided under applicable law. Unless otherwise specified, each beneficiary designation you file with us will cancel all previous ones. The consent of a beneficiary(ies) will not be required for you to revoke a beneficiary designation. If you have designated both primary and contingent beneficiaries and no primary beneficiary(ies) survives you, the contingent beneficiary(ies) will acquire the designated share of your Roth IRA. If you do not designate a beneficiary, or if all of your primary and contingent beneficiary(ies) predecease you, your estate will be the beneficiary.

If your surviving spouse is the designated beneficiary, your spouse may elect to treat your Roth IRA as his or her own Roth IRA, and would not be subject to the required minimum distribution rules. Your surviving spouse will also be entitled to such additional beneficiary payment options as are granted under the Code or applicable Regulations.

We may allow, if permitted by state law, an original Roth IRA beneficiary(ies) (the beneficiary(ies) who is entitled to receive distribution(s) from an inherited Roth IRA at the time of your death) to name a successor beneficiary(ies) for the inherited Roth IRA. This designation can only be made on a form provided by or acceptable to us, and it will only be effective when it is filed with us during the original Roth IRA beneficiary’s(ies’) lifetime or after as provided under applicable law. Unless otherwise specified, each beneficiary designation form that the original Roth IRA beneficiary(ies) files with us will cancel all previous ones. The consent of a successor beneficiary(ies) will not be required for the original Roth IRA beneficiary(ies) to revoke a successor beneficiary(ies) designation. If the original Roth IRA beneficiary(ies) does not designate a successor beneficiary(ies), his or her estate will be the successor beneficiary. In no event will the successor beneficiary(ies) be able to extend the distribution period beyond that required for the original Roth IRA beneficiary.

7\. Termination: Either party may terminate this Supplement at any time by giving written notice to the other. We can resign as custodian at any time effective thirty (30) days after we mail written notice of our resignation to you. On receipt of that notice, you must make arrangements to transfer the Roth IRA to another financial organization. If you do not complete a transfer of the Roth IRA within thirty (30) days from the date we mail the notice to you, we have the right to transfer the Roth IRA assets to a successor Roth IRA custodian or trustee that we choose in our sole discretion or we may distribute the Roth IRA to you. We will not be liable for any actions or failures to act on the part of the successor custodian or trustee nor for tax consequences you may incur that result from the transfer or distribution of the Roth IRA assets pursuant to this section.

If this Supplement is terminated, we may hold back from the Roth IRA a reasonable amount of money that we believe is necessary to cover any one or more of the following:

a. any fees, expenses or taxes chargeable against the Roth IRA;

b. any penalties associated with the early withdrawal of any savings instrument or other investment in the Roth IRA.

If our organization is merged with another organization (or comes under the control of any federal or state agency) or if our entire organization (or any portion which includes the Roth IRA) is bought by another organization, that organization (or agency) will automatically become the trustee or custodian of the Roth IRA, but only if it is the type of organization authorized to serve as a Roth IRA trustee or custodian.

If we are required to comply with Section 1.408-2(e) of the Regulations and we fail to do so, or we are not keeping the records, making the returns or sending the statements as are required by forms or Regulations, the IRS may, after notifying you, require that a substitute trustee or custodian be appointed.

8\. Amendments: We have the right to amend this Supplement at any time and charge a fee for IRS mandated amendments. Any amendment we make to comply with the Code and related Regulations does not require your consent. You will be deemed to have consented to any other amendment unless, within thirty (30) days from the date we mail the amendment, you notify us in writing that you do not consent.

9\. Withdrawals: All requests for withdrawal will be in writing on a form provided by or acceptable to us. The method of distribution must be specified in writing. The tax identification number of the recipient must be provided to us before we are obligated to make a distribution.

Any withdrawals will be subject to all applicable tax and other laws and regulations including possible early withdrawal penalties and withholding requirements.

You are not required to take a distribution from your Roth IRA at age 70½. At your death, however, your beneficiaries must begin taking distributions in accordance with Article V and section 9.06 of this Supplement. We will make no payouts to you from your Roth IRA until you provide us with a written request for a distribution on a form provided by or approved by us.

10\. Transfers from Other Plans: We can receive amounts transferred to the Roth IRA from the custodian or trustee of another Roth IRA. We reserve the right not to accept any transfer or rollover.

11\. Liquidation of Assets: We have the right to liquidate assets in the Roth IRA if necessary to make distributions or to pay fees, expenses or taxes properly chargeable against the Roth IRA. If you fail to direct us as to which assets to liquidate, we will decide in our complete and sole discretion and you agree not to hold us liable for any adverse consequences that result from our decision.

12\. Restrictions on the Fund: Neither you nor any beneficiary may sell, transfer or pledge any interest in the Roth IRA in any manner whatsoever, except as provided under applicable law or this Supplement. The assets in the Roth IRA will not be responsible for the debts, contracts or torts of any person entitled to distributions under this Supplement.

13\. What Law Applies: This Supplement is subject to applicable law. If it is necessary to apply any State law to interpret and administer this Supplement, the law of the state of South Dakota will govern.

If any part of this Supplement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the remaining parts will not be affected. Neither your nor our failure to enforce at any time or for any period of time any provision of this Supplement will be construed as a waiver of such provisions, or your right or our right thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. These rights and liabilities are continuous, covering individually and collectively, all accounts you may open with us or our agent for the same Roth IRA, and inure to the benefit of us, our successors or assigns and are binding on you and your heirs, successors or assigns.

14\. Indemnity of IRA Custodian and Administrator: To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) harmless against and from any and all claims, demands, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), arising in connection with this Supplement, with respect to (A) any negligence or alleged negligence, whether passive or active, by the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees), (B) any breach or alleged breach, whether passive or active, by the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) of any responsibilities under this Supplement, or (C) any breach or alleged breach, whether passive or active, by a third party of responsibilities under this Supplement. You further agree to pay for the defense of the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) by independent counsel of the IRA Custodian and Administrator’s choice against any such claims, demands, liabilities or costs referred to in the preceding sentence.

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) harmless against and from any and all payments or assessments which may result from holding any publicly-traded security or alternative investment within the Roth IRA account, and further agree that the IRA Custodian and Administrator, its subsidiaries and administrator (including their officers, agents and employees) will be under no obligation whatsoever to extend credit or otherwise disburse payment beyond the cash balance of your account for any payment or assessment related to such investment(s).

15\. Adverse Claims: If we receive any claim to the assets held in the Roth IRA which is adverse to your interest or the interest of your beneficiary, and we in our absolute discretion decide that the claim is, or may be, meritorious, we may withhold distribution until the claim is resolved or until instructed by a court of competent jurisdiction. As an alternative, we may deposit all or any portion of the assets in the Roth IRA into the court through a motion of interpleader. Deposit with the court will relieve us of any further obligation with respect to the assets deposited. We have the right to be reimbursed from the funds deposited for our legal fees and costs incurred.

16\. Fund Not Guaranteed: We do not guarantee the fund (the Roth IRA account) from loss or depreciation. Our liability to make payment to you at any time and all times is limited to the available assets of the fund.

17\. Arbitration Claims: Any controversy arising out of or relating to this Supplement or the breach thereof, or to the Roth IRA or any transactions authorized by you and/or your agent, will be determined by binding arbitration as described in Section 13 of this Program Agreement. The parties are waiving their right to seek remedies in court, including the right to jury trial. The pre-arbitration discovery is generally more limited than and different from court proceedings.

18\. Attorneys’ Fees:

a. If either party to this Supplement commences any legal action, suit, counterclaim, appeal, arbitration, or other proceeding (an “Action”) against the other party to this Supplement to enforce or interpret any terms of this Supplement, because of an alleged breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any terms of this Supplement, or because of a claim arising out of the terms of this Supplement, the losing or defaulting party will pay to the prevailing party reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the prosecution or defense of such Action.

b. If the prevailing party obtains a judgment in its favor arising out of any Action against the other party to this Supplement, the party against whom such judgment is rendered will pay to the prevailing party the attorneys’ fees incurred by the prevailing party in the collection or enforcement of such judgment. The provisions of this paragraph (b) will be severable from the other provisions of this Supplement, will survive any judgment, and will not be deemed merged into such judgment.

**Supplement F**

**Individual Retirement Account Disclosure Statement**

Forge Trust (f/k/a IRA Services Trust Company) is the Custodian and Administrator for Acorns IRA accounts, (known as Acorns Later Accounts).

The following information is the disclosure statement required by federal tax regulations. You should read this Disclosure Statement and the applicable custodial account agreement (i.e. the Traditional IRA Custodial Account Supplement or the Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement) for the Individual Retirement Arrangements (“IRA”). The rules governing IRAs are subject to change. The contribution limit information is based on federal law as stated in the Internal Revenue Code, and is believed to be accurate. However, eligibility to contribute is dependent on your tax filing status and personal situation. Please consult a competent tax advisor concerning your specific contribution eligibility, and any applicable state law which may differ from federal law.

You should consult Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Publication 590A/B or the IRS web site [www.irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/) for updated rules and requirements.

Important Information About U.S. Government Requirements That May Affect Your Account

Forge Trust (f/k/a IRA Services Trust Company), (“ISTC”, “we”, or “us”), provides custodial and administrative services for your retirement or savings account. As a result of this role, persons who open a retirement or savings account are considered ‘customers’ of ISTC (“you” or “your”).

To help the U.S. Government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires ISTC, as a non-depository trust company regulated by the State of South Dakota Division of Banking, to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. All accounts we open are opened on a conditional basis — conditioned on our ability to verify your identity in accordance with applicable law.

When establishing an account, you are required to provide your full legal name, address, government issued identification number (e.g. social security number), date of birth, and other information within your account-opening application that will allow us to identify you. We may also request a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents and may consult third-party databases to help verify your identity. If the account you are opening will be registered in the name of a beneficiary, we may require additional identifying documentation.

If you fail to provide any requested identifying information or documentation when opening your account, your new account application may be rejected.

If we open your account, and you subsequently fail to provide all identification materials we request or if we are subsequently unable to adequately verify your identity as required by U.S. government regulations, we reserve the right to take any one or more of the following actions:

1\. we may place restrictions on your account which block all purchase and investment transactions and we may place additional restrictions on your account blocking other transactional activities if we determine such additional restrictions are appropriate under applicable law; and

2\. we may close your account, sell (i.e., “liquidate”) the assets in your account in the prevailing market at the time, and send you a check representing the cash proceeds of your account or we may transfer all your assets in kind to your name. This distribution will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and may result in unfavorable consequences to you under federal and state tax laws.

You May Incur Losses

Despite being opened as a conditional account, your account will be invested as you instruct, and you will be subject to all market risks during the period between account opening and any liquidation necessitated by your failure to furnish requested identifying information or by an inability to adequately verify your identity. You may also be subject to additional market risks if the additional transactional restrictions discussed above are placed on your account. In addition, the closing of your account may subject you to fees and charges imposed by a sponsor, issuer, depository or other person or entity associated with one or more of the assets in which you are invested, and any sales charges you may have paid in connection with your purchases will not be refunded.

You Assume All Responsibility for These Losses

ISTC expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability for losses you incur as result of your failure to furnish identification materials we request, including investment losses and any other loss or damage (including but not limited to lost opportunities and adverse tax consequences). If you proceed with the account opening process, you accept all risks of loss resulting from any failure of yours to furnish the identification materials we request or from a subsequent inability to adequately verify your identity in accordance with applicable law.

State Unclaimed Property Law Disclosure

The assets in your custodial account are subject to South Dakota state unclaimed property laws which provide that if no activity occurs in your account within the period specified by state law, your assets must be transferred to the state. We are required under applicable law to advise you that your assets may be transferred to South Dakota state in compliance with these laws.

Revocation of Your IRA

You have the right to revoke your IRA and receive the entire amount of your initial investment by notifying the IRA Custodian and Administrator in writing within seven (7) days of establishing your IRA (account open date). If you revoke your IRA within seven (7) days, you are entitled to a return of the entire amount of the contributions or the actual property, without adjustment for such items as administrative expenses. If you decide to revoke your IRA, notice should be delivered or mailed to the address listed in the application instructions. This notice should be signed by you and include the following:

1\. the date;

2\. a statement that you elect to revoke your IRA;

3\. your IRA account number;

4\. the date your IRA was established; and

5\. your signature and your name printed or typed.

Mailed notice will be deemed given on the date that it is postmarked, if it is properly addressed and deposited either in the United States mail, first class postage prepaid, or with an IRS approved overnight service. This means that when you mail your notice, it must be postmarked on or before the seventh day after your IRA was opened. A revoked IRA will be reported to the IRS and the Depositor on IRS Forms 1099-R and 5498.

Contributions

For 2017 and 2018, the maximum allowable contribution to your individual retirement accounts (deductible, non-deductible, and Roth) for each tax year is the lesser of (a) $5,500 or (b) 100% of your compensation or earnings from self-employment.

Age 50 or Above Catch-Up Contributions

For those who have attained the age of 50 before the close of the taxable year, the annual IRA contribution limit is increased by $1,000 (for 2017 and 2018).

For tax years after 2017, the above limits may be subject to IRS cost-of-living adjustments, if any. Please read the Traditional and Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) Combined Disclosure Statement carefully or consult IRS Publication 590A/B or a qualified tax professional for more information about eligibility requirements and contribution restrictions.

Making an IRA contribution on behalf of your spouse — If you have earned compensation, are married and file a joint federal income tax return, you may make an IRA contribution on behalf of your working or nonworking spouse. The total annual contribution limit for both IRAs may not exceed the lesser of the combined compensation of both spouses or the annual IRA contribution limits as set forth by the IRS. Contributions made on behalf of a spouse must be made to a separate IRA account established by your spouse. More information about eligibility requirements and contribution restrictions can be found in IRS Publication 590A/B.

Any contribution made to your IRA will be treated as a contribution for the year it is received unless the contribution is made between January 1 and the April 15th postmark deadline and you have identified the contribution as a prior year contribution.

1\. Traditional IRA Contribution Restriction — You cannot make contributions to your traditional IRA for any taxable year after you attain age 70½.

2\. Roth IRA Contribution — Contributions can continue to be made to a Roth IRA after you attain age 70½ as long as the requirements of earned income are met.

Description of Available Options for Your Contributions

The assets in your custodial account will be invested in accordance with instructions communicated by you (or following your death, by your beneficiary) or by your (or following your death, your beneficiary’s) authorized agent. Account contributions are eligible for investment under section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that are acceptable to the IRA Custodian and Administrator as investments under the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) application and agreement. ISTC does not recommend any particular investment or asset class, nor do we perform due diligence or determine the suitability of any investment or asset category for our account holders and your investments are neither guaranteed nor protected.

**TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT DISCLOSURE**

You have opened an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), which is a Traditional IRA or SEP IRA (known as an Acorns Traditional IRA Custodial Account) for the exclusive benefit of you and your beneficiaries, created by a written instrument (the Traditional IRA Custodial Account Supplement). The following requirements apply to your IRA:

1\. contributions, transfers and rollovers may be made only in “cash” by check, draft, or other form acceptable to the IRA Custodian and Administrator;

2\. the IRA Custodian and Administrator must be a bank, trust company, savings and loan association, credit union or a person who is approved to act in such capacity by the Secretary of the Treasury;

3\. no part may be invested in life insurance contracts;

4\. no part may be invested in collectibles such as artwork, coins, stamps, rugs, antiques, beverages, and other personal property;

5\. no part may be invested in S-corp stock;

6\. no part may be invested in gemstones and metals (except for certain coins and bullion which are allowed);

7\. your interest must be nonforfeitable;

8\. the assets of the custodial account may not be mixed with other property except in a common investment fund; and

9\. you must begin receiving distributions from your account no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you attain age 70½; and distributions must be completed over a period that is not longer than the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary.

Traditional IRA Eligibility

You are permitted to make a regular contribution to your traditional IRA for any taxable year prior to the taxable year you attain age 70½ if you receive compensation for such taxable year. Compensation includes salaries, wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, alimony, royalties from creative efforts and “earned income” in the case of self-employment. The amount which is deductible depends on whether or not you are an active participant in a retirement plan maintained by your employer; your modified adjusted gross income; your marital status; and your tax filing status.

Traditional IRA Income Tax Deduction

Your contribution to a traditional IRA may be deductible on your federal income tax return. However, there is a phase-out of the IRA deduction if you are an active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan. The IRA deduction is reduced proportionately as adjusted gross income increases. Adjusted gross income levels are subject to change each year. Please consult IRS Publication 590A/B for calculating your deductible contribution as it pertains to individual income and employer-sponsored retirement plan circumstances. Your contributions in excess of the permitted deduction will be considered non-deductible contributions.

A deductible IRA contribution can be made to your spouse’s IRA even if you are an active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, if your joint adjusted gross income for the tax year does not exceed the limits as set forth by the IRS. The IRA deduction is reduced proportionally as your joint adjusted gross income increases. Please refer to IRS Publication 590A/B for current year phase-out limits.

Traditional IRA Taxation and Rollovers

The income of your IRA is not taxed until the money is distributed to you. Distributions are taxable as ordinary income when received, except the amount of any distribution representing non-deducted contributions or the return of an excess contribution is not taxed. In general, you may “rollover” a distribution from another IRA, an eligible rollover distribution from your employer’s qualified plan, or distributions from certain tax deferred annuities or accounts. If a distribution is rolled over (i.e. deposited in your IRA within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of receipt), the amount rolled over is not taxable. The IRS strictly enforces the 60-day time limit. You may rollover a portion of a distribution in which case the remainder will be subject to tax. The IRS requires 20% of any distribution from your employer’s qualified plan to be withheld for federal income tax unless your distribution is transferred (as a direct rollover) to an eligible retirement plan such as another qualified plan or IRA.

If you make a tax-free rollover of any part of a distribution from a traditional IRA, you cannot, within a 1-year period, make a tax-free rollover of any later distribution from that same or any other traditional IRA including from the traditional IRA into which you made the tax-free rollover. Please consult IRS Publication 590A/B for more information pertaining to rollover contributions.

Note: The rules regarding tax-free rollovers are complex and subject to frequent change; you should consult a professional tax advisor if you are considering a rollover.

Recharacterizing Traditional IRA Contributions

If you are eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, all or part of a contribution you make to your traditional IRA, along with allocable earnings or losses, may be recharacterized and treated as if made to your Roth IRA on the date the contribution was originally made to your traditional IRA. Recharacterization of a contribution is irrevocable and must be completed on or before the due date, including extensions, for filing your federal income tax return for the tax year for which the contribution was originally made. Please refer to IRS Publication 590A/B for more information.

A recharacterized contribution is reported as a distribution from the first IRA (IRS Form 1099-R) and a recharacterization contribution to the second IRA (IRS Form 5498) for the tax year in which the recharacterization occurs. The rules regarding recharacterization are complex and you should consult a professional tax advisor prior to any recharacterization.

Excess Contributions

Amounts contributed to your traditional IRA in excess of the allowable limit will be subject to a non-deductible excise tax of 6% for each year until the excess is used up (as an allowable contribution in a subsequent year) or returned to you. The 6% excise tax will not apply if the excess contribution and earnings allocable to it are distributed by your federal income tax return due date, including extensions. If such a distribution is made, only the earnings are considered taxable income for the tax year in which the excess was contributed to the IRA. The return of earnings may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax on early distributions discussed in the section titled “Early Distributions from a Traditional IRA”. If you make an excess contribution to your IRA and it is not corrected on a timely basis, an excise tax of 6% is imposed on the excess amount. This tax will apply each year to any part or all of the excess that remains in your account.

Earnings will be removed with the excess contribution, if corrected before your federal income tax return due date (including extensions), pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 408(d)(4) and IRS Publication 590A/B. The IRS may impose a 10% early distribution penalty on the earnings if you are under age 59½. An IRS Form 1099-R will be issued for the year in which the distribution occurred, not the year in which the excess contribution was made. Consult IRS Publication 590A/B for more information pertaining to excess contributions. If you are subject to a federal penalty tax due to an excess contribution, you must file IRS Form 5329.

For the purpose of the excess contribution, we will calculate the net income attributable to that contribution (Net Income Attributable or “NIA”) using the method provided for in the IRS Final Regulations for Earnings Calculation for Returned or Recharacterized Contributions. This method calculates the NIA based on the actual earnings and losses of the IRA during the time it held the excess contribution. Please note that a negative NIA is permitted and, if applicable, will be deducted from the amount of the excess contribution.

Excess contributions (plus or minus the NIA) that are distributed by your federal income tax return due date (including extensions) will be considered corrected, thus avoiding an excess contribution penalty.

Early Distributions from a Traditional IRA

Your receipt or use of any portion of your account (excluding any amount representing a return of non-deducted contributions) before you attain age 59½ is considered an early or premature distribution. The distribution is subject to a penalty tax equal to 10% of the distribution unless one of the following exceptions applies to the distribution:

1\. due to your death;

2\. made because you are disabled;

3\. used specifically for deductible medical expenses which exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income;

4\. used for health insurance cost due to your unemployment;

5\. used for higher education expenses defined in section 529(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code;

6\. used toward the expenses of a first-time home purchase up to a lifetime limit of $10,000;

7\. part of a scheduled series of substantially equal periodic payments over your life, or over the joint life expectancy of you and a beneficiary. If you request a distribution in the form of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, and you modify the payments before 5 years have elapsed and before attaining age 59½, the penalty tax will apply retroactively to the year payments began through the year of such modification;

8\. required because of an IRS levy; or

9\. the distribution is a Qualified Reservist Distribution.

The 10% penalty tax is in addition to any federal income tax that is owed at distribution. For more information on the 10% penalty tax and the exceptions listed above, consult IRS Publication 590A/B. If you are subject to a federal penalty tax due to a premature distribution, you must file IRS Form 5329.

Required Distributions from a Traditional IRA

You are required to begin receiving minimum distributions from your IRA by your required beginning date (April 1 of the year following the year you attain age 70½). The year you attain age 70½ is referred to as your “first distribution calendar year”. Your required minimum distribution for each year, beginning with the calendar year you attain age 70½, is generally based on the value of your account at the end of the prior year divided by the factor for your age (derived from the IRS Uniform Lifetime Distribution Period Table). This table assumes you have a designated spouse beneficiary exactly 10 years younger than you. However, if your spouse is your sole beneficiary and is more than 10 years younger than you, your required minimum distribution for each year is based on the joint life expectancies of you and your spouse. The account balance that is used to determine each year’s required minimum distribution amount is the prior year end fair market value (value as of December 31st), adjusted for outstanding rollovers, transfers and recharacterizations (that relate to a conversion or failed conversion made in the prior year). You are responsible for notifying the IRA Custodian and Administrator of any outstanding amounts.

If the amount distributed during a taxable year is less than the minimum amount required to be distributed, you will be subject to a penalty tax equal to 50% of the difference between the amount distributed and the amount required to be distributed. You are responsible for monitoring this schedule from year to year to make sure that you are withdrawing the required minimum amount. If you are subject to a federal penalty tax due to a missed required minimum distribution, you must file IRS Form 5329.

However, no payment will be made from this IRA until you provide the IRA Custodian and Administrator with a proper distribution request acceptable by the IRA Custodian and Administrator. On receipt of such distribution request, you may switch to a joint life expectancy in determining the required minimum distribution if your spouse was your sole beneficiary, as of the January 1st of the calendar year that contains your required beginning date, and such spouse is more than 10 years younger than you. The required minimum distribution for the second distribution calendar year and for each subsequent distribution calendar year must be made by December 31 of each such year. A required minimum distribution election form is available from the IRA Custodian and Administrator.

Traditional IRA Distributions Due to Death

If, prior to your death, you have not started to take your required distributions and you properly designated a beneficiary(ies), the entire value of your IRA must be distributed to your beneficiaries within five (5) years after your death, unless the designated beneficiary elects in writing, no later than September 30th of the year following the year in which you die, to take distributions over their life expectancy. These distributions must commence no later than December 31st of the calendar year following the calendar year of your death. However, if your spouse is your sole beneficiary, these distributions are not required to commence until the December 31st of the calendar year you would have attained age 70½ if that date is later than the required commencement date in the previous sentence or your spouse may elect to make your IRA their own. If you die before your required beginning date and you do not have a designated beneficiary, the balance in your IRA must be distributed no later than the December 31st of the calendar year that contains the fifth anniversary of your death.

If you die on or after your required beginning date and you have a designated beneficiary, the balance in your IRA will be distributed to your beneficiary over the beneficiary’s single life expectancy. These distributions must commence no later than December 31st of the calendar year following the calendar year of your death. If you die on or after your required beginning date and you do not have a designated beneficiary, the balance in your IRA must be distributed over a period that does not exceed your remaining single life expectancy determined in the year of your death. However, the required minimum distribution for the calendar year that contains the date of your death is still required to be distributed. Such amount is determined as if you were still alive throughout that year. If your spouse is your sole beneficiary, your spouse may elect to treat your IRA as their own IRA, whether you die before or after your required beginning date. If you die after your required beginning date and your spouse elects to treat your IRA as his or her own IRA, any required minimum that has not been distributed for the year of your death must still be distributed to your surviving spouse and then the remaining balance can be treated as your spouse’s own IRA. After your death, your designated beneficiary may name a subsequent beneficiary. Any subsequent beneficiaries must take distributions at least as frequently as the original designated beneficiary. If you do not properly designate a beneficiary, or all designated beneficiaries have predeceased you, your spouse will become the beneficiary or, if no surviving spouse or unmarried, the distribution will be made to your estate. Consult IRS Publication 590A/B for a complete discussion of rules governing distributions due to death.

Per Stirpes Designations

The IRA Custodian and Administrator will accept as complete and accurate all written instructions provided in good order by the estate/executor with regard to the identification of your beneficiaries and the allocations thereto.

Traditional IRA — IRS Approved Form

Your traditional IRA is the Internal Revenue Service’s model custodial account contained in IRS Form 5305-A. Certain additions have been made in Article VIII of the form. By following the form, your traditional IRA meets the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the IRS has not endorsed the merits of the investments allowed under the IRA. Form 5305-A may also be used by qualifying employers in conjunction with Form 5305-SEP to establish a Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP) on behalf of employees. If your IRA is part of a SEP, details regarding the plan should also be provided by your employer. IRS Form 5305-A cannot be used in connection with Roth IRAs.

**ROTH INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT DISCLOSURE**

You have opened a Roth Individual Retirement Account (Roth IRA) (known as an Acorns Roth IRA Custodial Account), which is an account for the exclusive benefit of you and your beneficiaries, created by a written instrument (the Roth IRA Custodial Account Supplement). The following requirements apply to your Roth IRA:

1\. contributions, transfers and rollovers may be made only in “cash” by check, draft, or other form acceptable to the IRA Custodian and Administrator;

2\. the IRA Custodian and Administrator must be a bank, trust company, savings and loan association, credit union or a person who is approved to act in such capacity by the Secretary of the Treasury;

3\. no part may be invested in life insurance contracts;

4\. your interest must be nonforfeitable;

5\. the assets of the custodial account may not be mixed with other property except in a common investment fund;

6\. there is no age limit on contributions as long as you have earned income;

7\. your adjusted gross income must be within the eligibility limits (see IRS Publication 590A/B for current year limits); and

8\. there are no mandatory withdrawals during your lifetime.

Roth IRA Eligibility

You are permitted to make a regular contribution to your Roth IRA for any taxable year if you receive compensation for such taxable year. Compensation includes salaries, wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, alimony, royalties from creative efforts and “earned income” in the case of self-employment.

Contributions can continue to be made to a Roth IRA after you attain age 70½ as long as the requirements of earned income are met.

There is a phase-out of eligibility to make a Roth IRA contribution if your adjusted gross income is between certain levels. These limits may be adjusted from time to time by the Internal Revenue Service, please refer to IRS Publication 590A/B for current year limits.

Roth IRA Income Tax Deduction

Your contribution to a Roth IRA is not deductible on your federal income tax return.

Roth IRA Rollovers

If a Roth IRA distribution is rolled over (i.e. deposited into another Roth IRA within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of receipt), the amount rolled over is not taxable. The IRS strictly enforces the 60-day time limit. Rollovers from a Roth IRA to a Coverdell ESA, traditional, SEP or SIMPLE IRA are not permitted. If you make a tax- free rollover of any part of a distribution from a Roth IRA, you cannot, within a 1-year period, make a tax-free rollover of any later distribution from that same Roth IRA or, from the Roth IRA into which you made the tax-free rollover.

Rollover from a Designated Roth Contribution Account Under an Employer-Sponsored Plan into a Roth IRA

Amounts attributable to a participant’s designated Roth contribution account under an employer’s 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan are eligible to roll over into a Roth IRA as either a direct rollover or a 60-day rollover. Once the amount is rolled over to a Roth IRA it may not be rolled back to an employer’s plan. The rules regarding designated Roth rollovers to Roth IRAs are complex and you should consult IRS Publication 590A/B or a tax advisor prior to initiating a designated Roth rollover.

Military Death Gratuities and Service Members Group Life Insurance (SGLI) Payment Rollovers

If you received a military death gratuity or SGLI payment, you may contribute all or part of the amount received to your Roth IRA. The contribution is treated as a rollover, except that this type of rollover does not count when figuring the annual limit on the number of rollovers allowed. The amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA under this provision cannot exceed the total amount of such payments that you received because of the death of a person reduced by any part of the amount so received that you have already contributed to a Roth IRA.

Recharacterizing a Roth IRA Contribution

All or part of a contribution you make to your Roth IRA, along with any allocable earnings or losses, may be recharacterized and treated as if made to your traditional IRA on the date the contribution was originally made to your Roth IRA. All or part of a contribution you make to your traditional IRA may be recharacterized and treated as if made to your Roth IRA on the date the contribution was originally made to your traditional IRA. Recharacterization of a contribution is irrevocable and must be completed on or before the due date, including extensions, for filing your federal income tax return for the tax year for which the contribution was originally made. Please refer to IRS Publication 590A/B for more information.

A recharacterized contribution is reported as a distribution from the first IRA (IRS Form 1099-R) and a recharacterization contribution to the second IRA (IRS Form 5498) for the tax year in which the recharacterization occurs. The rules regarding recharacterization are complex and you should consult a professional tax advisor prior to any recharacterization. A recharacterization form is available from the IRA Custodian and Administrator and should be used for all recharacterization request.

Excess Contributions

Amounts contributed to your Roth IRA in excess of the allowable limit will be subject to a non-deductible excise tax of 6% for each year until the excess is used up (as an allowable contribution in a subsequent year) or returned to you. The 6% excise tax on excess contributions will not apply if the excess contribution and earnings allocable to it are distributed by your federal income tax return due date, including extensions. If such a distribution is made, only the earnings are considered taxable income for the tax year in which the excess was contributed to the IRA. The return of earnings may also be subject to the 10% penalty tax on early distributions. An IRS Form 1099-R will be issued for the year in which the distribution occurred, not the year in which the excess contribution was made. Consult IRS Publication 590A/B for more information pertaining to excess contributions. If you make an excess contribution to your Roth IRA and it is not corrected on a timely basis, an excise tax of 6% is imposed on the excess amount. This tax will apply each year to any part or all of the excess that remains in your account.

Earnings will be removed with the excess contribution if corrected before your federal income tax return due date (including extensions), pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 408(d)(4) and IRS Publication 590A/B. The IRS may impose a 10% early distribution penalty on the earnings if you are under age 59½. If you are subject to a federal penalty tax due to an excess contribution, you must file IRS Form 5329.

For the purpose of the excess contribution, we will calculate the net income attributable to that contribution (Net Income Attributable or “NIA”) using the method provided for in the IRS Final Regulations for Earnings Calculation for Returned or Recharacterized Contributions. This method calculates the NIA based on the actual earnings and losses of the Roth IRA during the time it held the excess contribution. Please note that a negative NIA is permitted and, if applicable, will be deducted from the amount of the excess contribution.

Excess contributions (plus or minus the NIA) that are distributed by your federal income tax return due date (plus extensions) will be considered corrected, thus avoiding an excess contribution penalty.

Taxation of Roth IRA Distributions

Any distribution, or portion of any distribution, which consists of the return of contributions you made to your Roth IRA is not subject to federal income tax. For federal income tax purposes, contributions are presumed to be withdrawn first, then conversion contributions, then earnings.

Qualified Distribution

The earnings on your contributions will not be subject to federal income tax or penalty if the assets being withdrawn have been in your Roth IRA for at least five (5) years (from the first taxable year in which your initial contribution, including rollover or conversion contribution, was made to the Roth IRA) in addition to any one of the following:

1\. you have attained age 59½,

2\. used toward the expenses of a first-time home purchase up to a lifetime limit of $10,000,

3\. made because you are disabled, or

4\. due to your death.

Non-Qualified Distribution

The earnings portion of a distribution made prior to the end of the five-year holding period, regardless of the reason, is considered a non-qualified distribution and is subject to ordinary income tax. The earnings may also be subject to a 10% penalty tax if you are under age 59½ unless an early distribution exception applies. The distribution of amounts attributable to conversion contributions (prior to five years from the tax year of conversion) may be subject to a 10% penalty tax if you are under age 59½ unless an early distribution exception applies. Exceptions to the 10% penalty tax on early distributions are described in the section titled “Early Distributions from a Roth IRA”. If you are subject to a federal penalty tax due to a premature distribution, you must file IRS Form 5329.

Early Distributions from a Roth IRA

The earnings portion of distributions made prior to the end of the five-year holding period, or which fail to meet the criteria as outlined in “Taxation of Roth IRA Distributions”, are subject to ordinary income taxes. The earnings portion of the distribution is also subject to the 10% penalty tax on early distributions unless one of the following exceptions applies to the distribution:

1\. you have attained age 59½,

2\. due to your death,

3\. made because you are disabled,

4\. used specifically for deductible medical expenses which exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income,

5\. used for health insurance cost due to your unemployment,

6\. used for higher education expenses defined in section 529(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code,

7\. used toward the expenses of a first-time home purchase up to a lifetime limit of $10,000,

8\. part of a scheduled series of substantially equal payments over your life, or over the joint life expectancy of you and a beneficiary. If you request a distribution in the form of a series of substantially equal payments, and you modify the payments before 5 years have elapsed and before attaining age 59½, the penalty tax will apply retroactively to the year payments began through the year of such modification,

9\. required because of an IRS levy, or

10\. the distribution is a Qualified Reservist Distribution.

The 10% penalty tax is in addition to any federal income tax that is owed at distribution. For more information on the 10% penalty tax and the exceptions listed above, consult IRS Publication 590A/B.

Roth IRA Required Distributions

You are not required to take distributions from your Roth IRA during your lifetime.

Roth IRA Distribution Due to Death

If you have properly designated a beneficiary(ies), the entire value of your Roth IRA must be distributed to your beneficiaries within five (5) years after your death, unless the designated beneficiary elects in writing, no later than September 30th of the year following the year in which you die, to take distributions over their life expectancy. Your spouse may also elect to make it their own Roth IRA. Non-spousal distributions must commence no later than December 31st of the calendar year following the calendar year of your death. Your designated beneficiary may name a subsequent beneficiary. Any subsequent beneficiaries must take distributions at least as frequently as the original designated beneficiary.

If you do not properly designate a beneficiary, or all designated beneficiaries have predeceased you, your spouse will become the beneficiary or, if no surviving spouse or unmarried, the distribution will be made to your estate. If your designated beneficiary is your spouse, your spouse may elect to treat your Roth IRA as their own. Consult IRS Publication 590A/B for a complete discussion of rules governing distributions due to death.

Per Stirpes Designations

The IRA Custodian and Administrator will accept as complete and accurate all written instructions provided in good order by the estate/executor with regard to the identification of your beneficiaries and the allocations thereto.

Roth IRA — IRS Approved Form

Your Roth IRA is the Internal Revenue Service’s model custodial account contained in IRS Form 5305-RA. Certain additions have been made in Article IX of the form. By following the form, your Roth IRA meets the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the IRS has not endorsed the merits of the investments allowed under the Roth IRA. IRS Form 5305-RA cannot be used in connection with SEP or traditional IRAs.

COMBINED DISCLOSURES, CONTINUED:

Tax Refund Direct Deposit IRA Contributions

Taxpayers who qualify for a tax refund may elect to directly deposit their refund into their IRA account. The amount of the refund deposited to your IRA cannot exceed annual IRA limits as set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. You must contact the IRA Custodian and Administrator in advance of completing IRS Form 8888 to obtain the proper routing instructions. All tax refund contributions will be recorded as current year contributions for the year received.

Health Savings Account (“HSA”) Funding Distribution

You are allowed a one-time, tax-free transfer from an IRA (other than a SEP IRA) to use toward your annual Health Savings Account (“HSA”) contribution. Eligible individuals may make an irrevocable one-time, tax-free “qualified HSA funding distribution” from an IRA and move it directly into an HSA, subject to strict requirements. The HSA funding distribution must be directly transferred from the IRA Custodian and Administrator to the HSA custodian or trustee. The amount of the transfer cannot exceed the maximum HSA contribution limit for the year that the amount is transferred. The deposited amount is counted toward the individual’s total HSA annual contribution limit.

Non-Spouse Beneficiaries of Employer Plans

Eligible non-spouse beneficiary distributions from an employer’s retirement plan can be directly rolled over into a beneficiary/inherited IRA. To accomplish the direct rollover, the plan administrator must distribute the benefit payable to the trustee or custodian and mail it directly to the receiving institution. If the distribution is paid directly to the non-spouse beneficiary, a rollover will not be permitted.

The beneficiary/inherited IRA account must be registered in both the non-spouse beneficiary’s name and the decedent’s name.

Qualified Reservist Distributions

Early distributions paid to military reservists called to active duty after September 11, 2001 (“Qualified Reservist Distributions”) are eligible to be repaid to an IRA within a two-year period after the end of active duty. This provision applies to distributions made after September 11, 2001. Repayments cannot exceed the amount of your Qualified Reservist Distributions. Repayment cannot be made after the later of either the date that is two (2) years after your active-duty period ends, or August 16, 2008. The repayments are not treated as rollovers. For additional information refer to IRS Publication 590A/B under the heading “Qualified reservist repayments.”

Qualified Charitable Distributions Effective Through 2011

Effective for distributions through December 31, 2014, taxpayers age 70½ or older may transfer funds from their IRA to an eligible charitable organization. Qualified charitable distributions may be made from a traditional IRA, Roth IRA or equivalent beneficiary/ inherited IRA account. Qualified charitable distributions may be used to satisfy a participant’s required minimum distribution requirement. The maximum total amount of qualified charitable distributions that may be made during a year by an IRA owner is $100,000 regardless of how many IRAs the participant owns. For married individuals filing a joint return the limit is $100,000 for each individual IRA owner. The distribution proceeds from the IRA or beneficiary/inherited IRA must be made payable to the charitable organization. Not all charities are eligible. More information about qualified charitable distributions can be found in IRS Publication 590A/B.

Prohibited Transactions

If you or your beneficiary engages in any prohibited transaction as described in the Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(c) (such as any sale, exchange, borrowing, or leasing of any property between you and your IRA; or any other interference with the independent status of the account), the account will lose its exemption from tax and be treated as having been distributed to you on first day of the tax year in which you or your beneficiary engaged in the prohibited transaction. The distribution may also be subject to additional penalties including a 10% penalty tax if you have not attained age 59½. See Publication 590A/B for further instructions on calculating taxable gain, reporting amounts in income and prohibited transaction penalty taxes. In addition, if you or your beneficiary use (pledge) all or any part of your IRA as security for a loan, then the portion so pledged will be treated as if distributed to you, and will be taxable to you. Your distribution may also be subject to a 10% penalty tax if you have not attained age 59½ during the year which you make such a pledge.

Estate Tax

Amounts payable to your spouse, as your named beneficiary, may qualify for a marital tax deduction for federal estate tax purposes.

Income Tax Withholding

The IRA Custodian and Administrator is required to withhold federal income tax from any taxable distribution from your IRA at the rate of 10% unless you choose not to have tax withheld. You may elect out of withholding by advising the IRA Custodian and Administrator in writing, prior to the distribution, that you do not want tax withheld from the distribution. This election may be made on any distribution request form provided by the IRA Custodian and Administrator. If you do not elect out of tax withholding, you may direct the IRA Custodian and Administrator to withhold an additional amount of tax in excess of 10%.

State income tax withholding may also apply to distributions from your IRA account when federal income tax is withheld. Please contact your tax advisor or state tax authority for information about your state’s income tax withholding requirements.

Additional Information

Distributions under $10 will not be reported on IRS Form 1099-R (as allowed under IRS regulations). However, you must still report these distributions to the IRS on your Form 1040 (as well as other forms that may be required to properly file your tax return).

For more detailed information, you may obtain IRS Publication 590A/B, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) from any district office of the Internal Revenue Service or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM.

Filing with the IRS

Contributions to your IRA must be reported on your tax return (Form 1040 or 1040A, and Form 8606 for nondeductible traditional IRA contributions) for the taxable year contributed. If you are subject to any of the federal penalty taxes due to excess contributions, premature distributions, or missed required minimum distributions, you must file IRS Form 5329.

G1.8 Closing Acorns Checking Accounts

If you should choose to close your Acorns Checking Account, notify Acorns Customer Service in the Application, by email at support@acorns.com, or by calling (855) 739-2859.

If your Acorns Invest Account has a negative balance for thirty (30) or more days, you agree that Acorns may transfer funds from your Acorns Checking Account, should it have a positive balance, to your Acorns Invest Account to bring such account to a zero balance.

G2. Subscription Fee for Acorns Checking Accounts

G2.1 Additional Services Covered by Subscription Fee

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Supplements, the services covered by the Subscription Fee will include any fees due to be paid or expenses due to be reimbursed to Acorns Pay in connection with Acorns Checking Accounts. You agree to pay the Subscription Fee in accordance with the Supplements, including Section 4 and Schedule 1 of this Program Agreement. You acknowledge that the Subscription Fee may change from time to time and will be available on the Acorns Website. Except for the Subscription Fees payable pursuant to Section 4 and Schedule 1 of this Program Agreement, Acorns Pay will not charge you any fees in connection with an Acorns Checking Account or the Banking Services.

The Banks of Record will not charge you any fee in connection with an Acorns Checking Account.

G2.2 Debit Authorization to Pay Subscription Fee

You further agree you will pay the Subscription Fee by recurring monthly ACH debit and electronic funds transfer that will deduct money from your Primary Funding Source. You authorize Acorns and/or its agents to initiate the recurring monthly debit from your Primary Funding Source in Section A6 of the Investment Advisory Agreement Supplement. If you choose an Acorns Checking Account, you agree your Acorns Checking Account may be the Primary Funding Source from which your Subscription Fee will be deducted. If your Acorns Checking Account is your Primary Funding Source and Acorns is unable to collect your Subscription Fee via ACH payment from your Acorns Checking Account, you authorize Acorns and/or its agents to collect your Subscription Fee in accordance with Section 4 of this Program Agreement. If you have chosen an Acorns Checking Account but have not funded that account, Acorns will deduct your Subscription Fee, including the relevant fee for your Acorns Checking Account, from your other Funding Source.

G3. Smart Deposit

Smart Deposit is an optional feature available to Acorns Checking Accountholders who have direct deposit established for paychecks. You will be able to select a percentage of your direct deposit to be allocated to your Acorns Invest Account and your Acorns Later Account. By using this feature, you authorize Acorns to use the ACH network to move the funds you select from your Acorns Checking Account to your Acorns Invest Account and your Acorns Later Account. 

Participation in this feature is optional and may be terminated at any time. You may make changes to your allocation until your direct deposit has settled, which occurs eighteen (18) hours after Acorns detects your direct deposit paycheck. You will receive a push notification when Acorns detects your direct deposit and receive an additional prompt in the Application to make changes during that eighteen (18) hour period. Acorns will make its best efforts to suspend transfers to your Acorns Later Account if it detects you have met the annual IRA contribution limit, however Acorns makes no assurances that this will be accurate and has no way to know what contributions are made to accounts held outside of Acorns. For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for monitoring your contribution limits and preventing the exceeding of such limits. If Acorns believes it has detected your contribution limit has been met, it will send you a communication to alert you and remind you that the full investment allocation will be placed in your Acorns Invest Account going forward.

G4. Bank of Record

At present, Acorns Pay has engaged two banks of record, however it may engage additional banks of record in the future.

Lincoln Savings Bank and nbkc are banks chartered under the laws of Iowa and Kansas, respectively, and are members of the FDIC. Applying for an Acorns Checking Account means you will be submitting an application for a checking account to one of the Banks of Record. All applications for Acorns Checking Accounts are subject to approval by the relevant Bank of Record. The Banks of Record are not parties to this Program Agreement or any Supplement.

G5. Roles, Rights and Duties

By agreeing to this Program Agreement, you acknowledge you will be bound, and represent and warrant to Acorns Pay that you will abide by, the terms and conditions of the applicable Bank of Record Agreements. If there is any conflict or discrepancy between the Bank of Record Agreements and any other Supplement, the Bank of Record Agreements will govern with respect to Acorns Checking Accounts subject to the following sentence and Section G6, which will govern to the extent either conflicts with the Bank of Record Agreements.

**Supplement H**

**Custom Portfolio Account Supplement**  

_NOTE: Custom Portfolio Accounts are only available to an early access group of Subscribers at this time._ 

This Custom Portfolio Account Supplement (“Supplement”) is part of this Program Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Supplement, defined terms have the same meaning as in this Program Agreement. In the event that any provision in this Supplement conflicts or is inconsistent with any provision of this Program Agreement, the provisions of this Supplement will control for matters or services related to this Supplement. 

NOTHING IN THIS SUPPLEMENT LIMITS OR WAIVES ANY RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS GOVERNING THE PROVISION OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY OR FIDUCIARY SERVICES TO YOU (INCLUDING AS APPLICABLE THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED, AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED, APPLICABLE TO RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS), OUR OBLIGATION TO ACT IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS WHEN PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO YOU, OR PREVENTS YOU FROM SEEKING RECOURSE FROM ACORNS IN THAT CONNECTION. ACORNS ENCOURAGES YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL CONCERNING THOSE RIGHTS BEFORE ENTERING INTO THIS PROGRAM AGREEMENT AND ANY TIME YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SUCH RIGHTS. 

The terms and conditions of the Program Agreement, including THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION - MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS IN SECTION 13 OF THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT, are incorporated into this Supplement between Acorns and you.

Under this Supplement, as an accommodation and on a basis that is incidental to the investment advisory services Acorns Advisers provides, you may direct Acorns Advisers to place your Self-Directed Orders for your Custom Portfolio Account with Acorns Securities. Acorns Advisers does not act as a broker and does not charge any compensation for the Custom Portfolio program with the exception of the Subscription Fee and any fees identified in “Other Fees for Specially Requested Services and Irregular Occurrences” in  Schedule 1, hereto. Acorns Advisers reserves the right to not accept any requested Self-Directed Order in its sole discretion.

H1. Your Responsibility for Self-Directed Orders; No Investment Advice or Recommendations

You are solely responsible for any Self-Directed Orders placed through your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, and you understand that all Self-Directed Orders you submit using your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account are based on your investment decisions. You are responsible for the suitability of any investments or investment decisions you make in your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, and Acorns’ placement of Self-Directed Orders at your direction does not signify any view or judgment on the part of Acorns Advisers or Acorns Securities that the investments or investment decisions are suitable for you or consistent with how Acorns Advisers manages your Acorns Invest Account. Acorns Advisers will not be liable for any losses or other damages resulting from your choice of securities to include in or exclude from your Custom Portfolio Account.

You agree that, while Acorns Advisers offers general education and advice on self-directed investing concepts applicable to your Custom Portfolio Account, Acorns Advisers does not provide investment advice on your specific Acorns Custom Portfolio Account investments or related investment decisions. Acorns Advisers will not consider the individual investments in your Custom Portfolio Account when managing the investments in your Acorns Base Portfolio.  Any research materials or information available through Acorns’ Website or the website of any of its affiliates are intended for informational and educational purposes only. They are not recommendations to enter into any specific securities transactions or to engage in any specific investment strategies in connection with your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account. Acorns Advisers will not provide any tax or legal advice. You understand that any transactions executed in your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, whether based on information obtained from Acorns Advisers or elsewhere, will be solely your decision and based on your evaluation of your investment objectives, financial resources, experience and risk.

H2. Order Handling 

Acorns Advisers aggregates all orders for the same security among Acorns Custom Portfolio Account accountholders and routes them to Acorns Securities for execution once a day (each, a “Window Trade”). Please refer to the FAQs available on the Website for more details on current Window Trade times. Self-Directed Orders are “not held”. This means that neither Acorns Advisers nor Acorns Securities has any obligation to seek to execute the orders in the market immediately on receipt. Routing and execution of Window Trades may be undertaken (i) before the close of regular trading hours on any given Business Day, or (ii) on the Business Day following submission of your Self-Directed Order, depending on when Acorns Advisers (and, in turn Acorns Securities) receives your Self-Directed Order. Executed Window Trades will be allocated to participating accounts pro rata at an average price for the related execution(s). At your request, Acorns Advisers will make available to you the underlying records reflecting the actual transaction prices. Acorns Securities executes Self-Directed Orders only when placed by Acorns Advisers, and does not accept purchase or sale orders from any Custom Portfolio Account owner.

You understand and agree that, given that your Self-Directed Orders will only be executed as Window Trades (and not immediate), the execution of your Self-Directed Orders may result in less favorable executions and prices than if you were to place your orders with a broker-dealer that accepts and executes market, limit or other orders that give you more control over the timing or terms of your orders.

H3. Limitations on Transaction Types

You acknowledge that your Custom Portfolio Account is a special type of account because it is to be used only in connection with your Self-Directed Orders. You further acknowledge that many types of typical brokerage products, services, and transactions are not available in your Custom Portfolio Account. The types of products, services, and transactions that will generally not be available in your Custom Portfolio Account include without limitation (i) transactions in corporate bonds, municipal or other government securities, mutual fund shares, private fund interests, limited partnership interests, or any securities other than the ETFs or Stocks made available through your Custom Portfolio Account; (ii) margin lending or trading; and (iii) short sales.

H4. Investment Credit Types

Presently, Deposits At-Will, recurring transfers, and Round-Ups® Deposits will be invested in your Base Portfolio Account and Custom Portfolio Account, based on your allocation targets. Real-Time Round-Ups® Deposits, Earn Rewards, Referral Rewards, and Smart Deposits are not presently available as investment types into your Custom Portfolio Account, and such investment types shall be deposited only into your Base Portfolio Account.

H5. Termination of Acorns Custom Portfolio Accounts

You, Acorns Advisers, or Acorns Securities may close any or all of your Acorns Custom Portfolio Accounts and terminate this Supplement at any time for any reason. You may close any or all of your Acorns Custom Portfolio Accounts and terminate this Supplement by sending an email request via support@acorns.com, provided that:  
  

* if you terminate any Supplement with respect to any Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, you will be deemed to simultaneously terminate all of the Supplements with respect to that Acorns Custom Portfolio Account;
* Acorns Securities will, before closing your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, settle any purchases or sales pending when Acorns initiates or receives a request to close your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account;
* Acorns Advisers and/or Acorns Securities may, before closing your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, deduct any unpaid and pro-rated portion of the respective Subscription Fees owed for the day Acorns received your closure instruction and days prior and any other fees owed for specially requested services or irregular occurrences, including paper delivery of documents or transfer or physical delivery of securities.

If you request to close any Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, Acorns Securities will sell all securities in your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account and send the proceeds, less any portion of the Subscription Fee and other fees due, to your Funding Source. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you close your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account and direct Acorns Securities to transfer any securities in the Account to another broker-dealer, Acorns Securities will (1) will transfer to the other broker-dealer, in accordance with your instructions, the whole share securities in your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account, and (2) liquidate fractional Stock positions and cash resulting from the sale of the interests will be transferred to your Funding Source, after each of the following are paid for with the proceeds of any such sale: any Withdrawals pending when the termination notice was received or sent by Acorns Securities; any portion of the Subscription Fees due; the fees charged for processing the in-kind transfer to another broker-dealer; and any other fees due.

H6. Investment Risks

You acknowledge that:

* the securities in your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account may increase or decrease in value.
* money invested in your Acorns Custom Portfolio Account is subject to market risk and the loss of up to the amount invested.
* past performance does not guarantee future results.

* by participating in the Program, you may lose opportunities to make other investments and to realize gains from such other investments.
* data provided by Acorns Advisers and its service providers may not be free from error or inaccuracies.
* investments in Acorns Custom Portfolio Account are not guaranteed by the FDIC, any bank, or any government.
* your self-directed Custom Portfolio Account is designed for investments in securities purchased based on allocation decisions you make without any advice or recommendations from Acorns, other than general advice on investment advisory concepts and investment education that are not specific to your Custom Portfolio Account or investments.
* removing any securities from your self-managed Custom Portfolio Account will change the weightings of ETFs and Stocks in the resulting altered portfolio in a way that may deviate from the allocation decisions that you provided to Acorns Advisers and may adversely impact performance.
