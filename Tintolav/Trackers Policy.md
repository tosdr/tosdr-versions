**What are cookies?**  
Cookies are small text files that the websites visited by the user send to their computers. Cookies are memorised on devices (such as computers, tablets, smartphones and on any appliance used to surf the web) and at next visit of the same user are resent to the relative websites.  
To know more we suggest you to read our cookie policy, which is available here (and the privacy policy of our website, which can be read at the following link: [https://www.tintolav.com/en/privacy.html](https://www.tintolav.com/en/privacy.html) ). You can choose what cookies to accept and go on, or else you can configure the single cookies by following the below-mentioned directions. There are various types of cookies, some to make the use of the website more effective, others to enable certain functions.

**What cookies are used on this website?**  
tintolav.com website uses the cookies mentioned in the following table.  
Below you can also find the origin domain, the type of cookie and the default expiry.

| **Cookie** | **Service** | **Domain** | **Type** | **Expiry** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PHPSESSID | technical | tintolav.com | First part | Permanent |

Cookies included in Google Analytics allow the Company to collect and process information about the access to the website, the time of permanence of users and other data that are necessary to get a general picture of the use of the website itself.  
The data processed through these cookies are anonymized when they are collected. In this way, even if users’ data are tracked, the Company cannot associate this information to a person in a univocal way.

**Compulsory consent to cookies**  
Technical cookies cannot be disabled by the user, because they are necessary for the proper use of the website, but thanks to their own nature they cannot collect personal data.  
Instead, the cookies of Google Analytics can be excluded through the browser settings, even if they are considered merely technical cookies because they work on anonymised data.

**Cookie permanence on users’ computers**  
Cookies have a duration that depends on the expiry date (or on a specific action such as closing the browser), which is set at the moment of installation.  
Cookies can be:  
• temporary or session cookies: they are used to file temporary information, they link the actions of a specific session and they are removed by the computer when the browser is closed;  
• persistent cookies: they are used to file information, such as the layout settings or the font of texts, in order to prevent the users from modifying them each time they visit a specific website. They are memorised in the computer also after closing the browser.

**Cookie management**  
It is always possible to modify the consent to cookies by deleting them and coming back to homepage of the website, in compliance to current regulations about personal data protection, that is to say:  
• D.Lgs. 196/03, as modified by D.Lgs 101/2018;  
• Reg. 2016/679 CE – GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)  
• Measure of identification of simplified methods for the report and the request of consent to the use of cookies - 8th May 2014 (Published on the Official Gazette n. 126 of 3rd June 2014)  
The user can always exert the rights acknowledged by D.Lgs. 196/2003 and by the European regulation n.2016/679 and, in particular, among the others,  
• Right to access and obtain a copy of personal data;  
• Right of rectification and cancellation of personal data;  
• Right to limit the processing;  
• Right to revoke the consent;  
• Right of data portability;  
• Right of opposition.  
To exert these rights, it is possible to contact the Company at the following addresses:
