Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising under or in connection with this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration provisions and Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver provisions of the [NHL.com Terms of Service](https://www.nhl.com/info/terms-of-service).

The official sites and apps of the [Member Clubs](https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-affiliates-member-clubs#member) of the National Hockey League are part of the NHL.com website and the NHL mobile app ("Member Club Services").

        * **Other parties in response to legal process or when necessary to protect us or our Services.** We or our service providers may disclose your information -- including the contents of your communications -- to other parties when required or permitted by applicable law in the jurisdictions in which we or our service providers are located, such as when we have a good faith belief that:
            * Doing so is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
            * The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
            * An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person or persons; or
            * Doing so is necessary to protect our rights or property, defend against legal claims, or to enforce our Terms of Service.
        * **Other parties in connection with certain business transactions.** In the event of a prospective or actual change in ownership of the NHL (or any portion of our assets) as a result of a merger, acquisition, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another entity. If such a transaction occurs, we will notify you in an update to this Privacy Policy or through another appropriate means.
        * **Interactive features.** Information may also be shared with or made available to third parties when you post information to a public user profile or a public area of our Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool, or when you participate in public events or activities. You are responsible for any information you post to these interactive features. We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when using these features.
        
        We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated or deidentified information.
        
        4\. **Third Parties That Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality On Our Services.**
        
        Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include, for example:
        
        * **Content providers**, which may operate contests, sweepstakes, fantasy or interactive games, or public forums on our Services;
        * **Advertising providers**, such as ad networks and other advertising companies, which help us and our advertisers provide ads (on our Services or elsewhere online) that may be tailored to users' interests, including targeted advertising, and to understand users' response to those ads;
        * **Audience-measurement companies**, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services;
        * **Social networking services** (such as Facebook and Twitter), which may enable you to log in to certain of our Services, to comment on content available on our Services, and to share things you find on our Services with your social network; and
        * **Mobile location analytics providers**, which use geolocation data to facilitate the transmission of informational, marketing, and public service communications to you.
        
        Targeted Advertising: These and other third parties may collect and receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with advertising and other content) across your devices, including, for example, to make predictions about your preferences and deliver targeted advertising to you, both on and off our Services. Social networking services may be able to collect information about you, even if you do not click on or interact with their content on our Services or have an account with the social networking service.
        
        Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more and to opt out of such targeted advertising, please see the [Your Other Privacy Choices](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices) section below.
        
        Social Networking Services: The third-party social networking services with which we partner may notify your friends and other connections, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services depending on your settings. We may use the information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance your personal and social experience on our Services.
        
        You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from such third-party service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
        
        5\. **Data Subject Rights**
        
        Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you may have certain rights as a data subject under local law, including:

        * To request to update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information;
        * To request to delete certain personal information in our custody and control;
        * To request to withdraw or revoke consent, such as where we are relying on consent as the legal basis to process your personal information (where that concept is recognized) or where we are processing your sensitive personal information pursuant to your consent;
        * To request to object to or restrict the processing of your personal information;
        * To request us to cease disseminating or to de-index your personal information (if applicable).

You may also be entitled to appeal our decisions with respect to your data rights in accordance with local laws, and may do so by following the instructions provided in the correspondence we sent to you communicating our decision. You may also be entitled to appoint an authorized agent to exercise rights on your behalf, in which case we may request further information to validate the identity of your agent or that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.
        
        Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you also may have the right to request to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information. You can exercise your right to limit by clicking on the "Your Privacy Choices" link [here](https://www.nhl.com/info/your-privacy-choices) or in the footer of relevant websites and mobile applications. You may also, depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, have rights to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information, the "sharing" of your personal information (for targeted advertising), or all processing of your personal information for targeted advertising.
