**Privacy Policy**

_Last Updated and Effective Date - September 22, 2023_

This Privacy Policy describes the manner in which NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises, LLC, and its affiliates, including NHL Enterprises, L.P., NHL Enterprises Canada, L.P., and the National Hockey League, as well as their independent charities, NHL Foundation U.S., Inc. and the NHL Foundation (collectively, the "NHL," "we," "our," "us") use information in operating our websites, our mobile and other apps, and any other service that displays or provides an authorized link or reference to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services"). Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising under or in connection with this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration provisions and Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver provisions of the [NHL.com Terms of Service](https://www.nhl.com/info/terms-of-service).

The official sites and apps of the [Member Clubs](https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-affiliates-member-clubs#member) of the National Hockey League are part of the NHL.com website and the NHL mobile app ("Member Club Services"). This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use, and sharing of information by the NHL. The Member Clubs are responsible for their own privacy policies and practices, and you should review the applicable Member Club's privacy policy for information about its practices with respect to a Member Club Service.

If you do not agree to your information being used in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [NHL.com/contact](https://www.nhl.com/info/contact-us) (and select "Privacy" in the subject line) or as described under [Contact Us](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#contact) below.

    * **To understand fan engagement across the League.** We use the information we collect and receive, including from Member Clubs and other third-party sources, for performing internal analysis and building models to better understand NHL fans and fan engagement across the NHL and its Member Clubs so that we can customize and improve our Services, advertising and communications. We also conduct surveys to better understand our fans and fan engagement across the League. Our surveys may request demographic information about you and your household on an optional basis. We use and analyze survey responses for the purposes described above and, if applicable, to better understand the make-up and diversity of our fans.

    * **To provide effective advertising and marketing.** We also use the information we collect and receive to provide ads for our Services and certain third-party services, and to send you promotional communications, although you have certain rights with respect to these practices, as described below under the [Your Other Privacy Choices](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices) section. For example, we may use this information:
        
        * To show you ads (on and off our Services, including on third-party sites such as social networking services), including those that are based on your approximate location information and those that are based on your online activities over time, and across third-party sites and services ("targeted advertising"). For more information, see Section 4 below.
        * We also may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to third parties for the purposes of serving relevant advertising to you or others on third-party sites (including social media platforms).
        * To send you electronic and other marketing messages about the NHL, Member Clubs, or third-party Business Partners of the NHL that may be tailored to your preferences, characteristics, interests and interactions with us - for example, content related to your favorite Member Club, your engagement with the NHL or its Member Clubs or areas of our website you have visited.
        * To measure and evaluate the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns; and
        * To administer your participation in our contests, sweepstakes, fantasy or interactive games, or other promotions.
        
        We also may use the information we collect and receive for other purposes that may be described to you at the point of collection or for which you provide your consent.
        
        3\. **How We Share the Information We Collect and Receive.**

        We share information with the following types of third parties:
        
        * **Our affiliates and related entities.** We share information with current and future "affiliates," a term that includes our parent and subsidiary companies, joint venture partners, or other companies we control, are controlled by, or with which we are under common control for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also share information amongst these NHL entities, as well as the National Hockey League Foundation and the NHL Foundation.
        * **Our service providers.** We provide information to affiliated and unaffiliated service providers and others that perform certain functions or services for us, such as to host our Services and data, fulfill orders, provide products and services, manage databases, perform analyses or advertising services, administer our contests and sweepstakes, collect location data, provide location-based services, process credit card payments, provide customer service or chat features on the Services, or send communications for us.
        * **Member Clubs.** In addition to the information Member Clubs may collect about you in connection with your use of the Member Club Services, we may share information about you with our Member Clubs, including your contact information, demographic information, preferences, and information or inferences about your engagement across the NHL and its Member Clubs, and our Member Clubs may use this information for purposes including: customizing their advertising and communications and providing you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials and information that may be relevant to you, improving their products and services, and performing internal analysis. You can view a list of our Member Clubs [here](https://www.nhl.com/info/nhl-affiliates-member-clubs#member). You should review the privacy policies of these Member Clubs for information about their privacy practices and the choices they offer. Please see the [Your Other Privacy Choices](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices) section for more information on the choices we provide you.
        * **Business Partners.** When you consent to receive news and offers from them, we share information about you with select Business Partners, such as our sponsors, retailers, and broadcast partners, so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials and information that may be of interest to you.

We also may disclose personal information with co-brand and other partners when you choose to be involved in their programs or where you provide your information to us in order to transact with, donate to, or otherwise interact with the partner. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Business Partners or other third party partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.
        * **Advertising partners.** We may also disclose information to our advertising partners for targeted advertising purposes, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies as described further in Section 4 below. To learn more and to opt out of such targeted advertising, please see the [Your Other Privacy Choices](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices) section below.
        * **Other parties in response to legal process or when necessary to protect us or our Services.** We or our service providers may disclose your information -- including the contents of your communications -- to other parties when required or permitted by applicable law in the jurisdictions in which we or our service providers are located, such as when we have a good faith belief that:
            * Doing so is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
            * The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
            * An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person or persons; or
            * Doing so is necessary to protect our rights or property, defend against legal claims, or to enforce our Terms of Service.
        * **Other parties in connection with certain business transactions.** In the event of a prospective or actual change in ownership of the NHL (or any portion of our assets) as a result of a merger, acquisition, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another entity. If such a transaction occurs, we will notify you in an update to this Privacy Policy or through another appropriate means.
        * **Interactive features.** Information may also be shared with or made available to third parties when you post information to a public user profile or a public area of our Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool, or when you participate in public events or activities. You are responsible for any information you post to these interactive features. We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when using these features.
        
        We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated or deidentified information.
        
        4\. **Third Parties That Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality On Our Services.**
        
        Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include, for example:
        
        * **Content providers**, which may operate contests, sweepstakes, fantasy or interactive games, or public forums on our Services;
        * **Advertising providers**, such as ad networks and other advertising companies, which help us and our advertisers provide ads (on our Services or elsewhere online) that may be tailored to users' interests, including targeted advertising, and to understand users' response to those ads;
        * **Audience-measurement companies**, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services;
        * **Social networking services** (such as Facebook and Twitter), which may enable you to log in to certain of our Services, to comment on content available on our Services, and to share things you find on our Services with your social network; and
        * **Mobile location analytics providers**, which use geolocation data to facilitate the transmission of informational, marketing, and public service communications to you.
        
        Targeted Advertising: These and other third parties may collect and receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with advertising and other content) across your devices, including, for example, to make predictions about your preferences and deliver targeted advertising to you, both on and off our Services. Social networking services may be able to collect information about you, even if you do not click on or interact with their content on our Services or have an account with the social networking service.
        
        Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more and to opt out of such targeted advertising, please see the [Your Other Privacy Choices](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#choices) section below.
        
        Social Networking Services: The third-party social networking services with which we partner may notify your friends and other connections, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services depending on your settings. We may use the information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance your personal and social experience on our Services.
        
        You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from such third-party service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
        
        5\. **Data Subject Rights**
        
        Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you may have certain rights as a data subject under local law, including:
        
        * To request to access your personal information, including, where applicable, in a commonly-used electronic format, and to request other information about our data processing practices;
        * To request to update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information;
        * To request to delete certain personal information in our custody and control;
        * To request to withdraw or revoke consent, such as where we are relying on consent as the legal basis to process your personal information (where that concept is recognized) or where we are processing your sensitive personal information pursuant to your consent;
        * To request to object to or restrict the processing of your personal information;
        * To request us to cease disseminating or to de-index your personal information (if applicable).
        
        In each case, these rights are subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. If you would like to access, delete, or correct your information or otherwise exercise your rights, please contact us as set out in the [Contact Us](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy#contact) section below. Depending on the type of request you have made, we may request further information from you to verify your request, such as your account details and, where necessary, copies of government issued identification. You may also be entitled to appeal our decisions with respect to your data rights in accordance with local laws, and may do so by following the instructions provided in the correspondence we sent to you communicating our decision. You may also be entitled to appoint an authorized agent to exercise rights on your behalf, in which case we may request further information to validate the identity of your agent or that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.
        
        Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you also may have the right to request to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information. You can exercise your right to limit by clicking on the "Your Privacy Choices" link [here](https://www.nhl.com/info/your-privacy-choices) or in the footer of relevant websites and mobile applications. You may also, depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, have rights to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information, the "sharing" of your personal information (for targeted advertising), or all processing of your personal information for targeted advertising. You may also click on the "Your Privacy Choices" link to exercise these rights. Please also review the "Your Other Privacy Choices" section below for more information about how to make these advertising-related requests.
        
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising these rights, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you.
        

* 6\. **Your Other Privacy Choices.**
    
    You have a number of additional choices about how we handle information we collect and receive about you.
    
    * **Email.** You may opt out of receiving future promotional email communications from us by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in the footer of promotional email communications and updating your preferences. Please note that we may continue to send you transactional or service-related emails regarding your account. To opt-out of receiving emails from Member Clubs or Business Partners, please contact those parties directly.
    * **SMS and MMS.** You may opt out of receiving promotional SMS and MMS messages (i.e., text messages) from us by replying "STOP" to any message, which is free of charge. Please note that we may respond to your opt-out request with a message confirming that you have successfully opted out.
    
    **Targeted Advertising.** You have various choices related to targeted advertising.
    
    * You may opt out of receiving certain targeted advertising from participating companies by visiting the websites of the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/), [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/), and the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/).
    * Where available, and depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you also may disable optional cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies by visiting the NHL's "Cookie Settings" tool [here](https://www.nhl.com/info/cookie-settings).
    * Depending on your jurisdiction, we also will support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), a universal opt-out preference signal that communicates your privacy preferences to the websites you visit. For more information on the GPC, please visit their website [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about).
    
    These choices generally apply to the web browser you use, which means that you generally must opt out of each web browser on each device you use. If you opt out, you may still see ads from NHL, but the ads will be less relevant to you and your interests.
    
    In addition, depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you may have the right to opt out of the sharing of hashed email addresses and similar personal information with third parties (such as social media platforms) for targeted advertising purposes. Please submit a request by filling out the following form: [NHL.com/contact](https://www.nhl.com/info/contact-us). Please select the "Privacy" option in the subject line and include your first name, last name, and email address in the body of the email. Please insert into the description box, "_Opt Out of Sale/ Opt Out of Sharing for Targeted Advertising._"
    
    * **Do Not Track.** As distinct from the choices described above, some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites and online services should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.
        
    * **Disclosure of Personal Information to Member Clubs and Business Partners.**
        
        * Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, you may have the right to request to opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information in accordance with state laws. Please submit a request by filling out the following form: [NHL.com/contact](https://www.nhl.com/info/contact-us). Please select the "Privacy" option in the subject line and include your first name, last name, and email address in the body of the email. Please insert into the description box, "_Opt Out of Sale/Opt Out of Sharing for Targeted Advertising._"
        * You can opt out of (or, where you have provided consent, withdraw your consent to) the future sharing of your personal information with Member Clubs and Business Partners for those parties' own promotional purposes by filling out the following form: [NHL.com/contact](https://www.nhl.com/info/contact-us). Please select the "Privacy" option in the subject line and include your first name, last name, and email address in the body of the email. Please insert into the description box, "Opt Out of Business Partner Sharing" or "Opt Out of Member Club Sharing." Please note that even if you exercise these choices, the NHL may still share your information with Business Partners and Member Clubs where we are permitted to do so such as when they use that information to perform services we request and at your direction or pursuant to your interactions with them.
        * If you have an NHL.com account, you also may visit the "Email Preferences" tab to limit how we share certain information.
    * **League Fan Engagement:** For individuals in Canada, you can limit the NHL's use of information about your engagement across the NHL and its Member Clubs to build models that we use to better understand NHL fans and fan engagement across the NHL and its Member Clubs so that we can customize and improve our Services, advertising and communications. To opt-out, contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.nhl.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or complete the form available [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/c48a335c-3316-4893-8bc6-fcacbf57fc4a/5b38eaa6-1ff7-462b-9f7e-e26b7d448b46).

    7\. **Security & Retention**
    
    We have adopted physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to help protect against theft, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to or disclosure of the information we collect and receive. However, please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to our Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information, or any other disclosures out of our control.
    
    Your online access to some of your information may be protected with a password that you select. We strongly recommend that you select a unique password that is difficult to guess and that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls, or email messages).
    
    We retain personal information for only as long as we need it to provide the Services, for purposes described in this Privacy Policy, after which we take steps to delete or anonymize information. Among the criteria used to determine our retention periods include the length of your relationship with us, any retention periods that are mandated by law, and whether retention is required pursuant to litigation or regulatory investigations.
    
    8\. **Children's Privacy.**
    
    Our Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 or as otherwise defined by local law without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") or other applicable local law.
    
    9\. **Third Party Links.**
    
    Our Services may contain links to other sites that we do not own or operate. Also, links to our Services may be featured on third party services on which we advertise. We provide links to third-party services as a convenience to our users. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked services. The linked services should have separate and independent privacy statements, notices, and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over such services, and therefore we take no responsibility and assume no liability for the manner in which the entities that operate such linked services may collect, use, disclose, secure, or otherwise treat your information.
    
    10\. **Additional California Disclosures**

We rely on your consent to send you direct marketing messages about our products, services and promotions and to deliver targeted advertisements to you, both on and off the Services. If you do not provide certain information to us, we may, in some circumstances, be unable to comply with our obligations or provide you with the services that you request. We will tell you about the implications of not providing certain information.
