PRIVACY POLICY
--------------

At therapyshoppe.com (the "Site"), we respect your privacy and are firmly committed to protecting it when you visit our website. We will not sell, rent, lease, share, or disclose your personal information (name, email address, telephone or fax numbers, address, or credit numbers) to any third parties, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use the Site or its services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it.

The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, or credit card information.

**DATA COLLECTION:** Using some of our services may require that you register with a user name. Any user who registers with the site is considered a "registered user." We will ask you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address, and a password for your account), and we will use that information to provide the service. Any user purchasing products from the Site will also be required to provide credit card information.

**COOKIES:** We use "cookies" to collect certain bits of technical and navigational information that allows us to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart and tells us how you use our site (such as pages visited, etc). This information may be used to resolve technical issues, or be analyzed to improve our website functionality so we can serve you better! We do not collect or store personally identifiable information.

**INFORMATION SHARING:** We only share information under the following circumstances:

\--We may share the information submitted under your account with our business partners for order fulfillment and warranty issues (examples would be: processing your credit card information with VISA or Mastercard services or submitting your package/tracking information to UPS or the Postal Service as we process your order, etc). We will not disclose your account information to non-affiliated people or companies, except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy above.

\--We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Site, its users or the public.

**INFORMATION SECURITY:** Protecting your privacy and your information is a top priority. We take appropriate measures to secure both your information and our physical premises. We exercise reasonable care in providing safe transmission of your information from your PC to our servers (unless sent by a means outside of our control, such as e-mail). We utilize industry standard secure software (SSL), encrypted storage and password protection systems, etc. However, we cannot guarantee that our measures will completely bar unauthorized access to your information, and by using the Site you assume this risk.

**CHILDREN:** Children under the age of 13 should not send any information about themselves to us, including information like your name, address or e-mail address.
