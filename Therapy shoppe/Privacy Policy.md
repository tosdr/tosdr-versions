PRIVACY POLICY
--------------

At therapyshoppe.com (the "Site"), we respect your privacy and are firmly committed to protecting it when you visit our website. We will not sell, rent, lease, share, or disclose your personal information (name, email address, telephone or fax numbers, address, or credit numbers) to any third parties, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use the Site or its services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it.

The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, or credit card information.

**DATA COLLECTION:** Using some of our services may require that you register with a user name. Any user who registers with the site is considered a "registered user." We will ask you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address, and a password for your account), and we will use that information to provide the service. Any user purchasing products from the Site will also be required to provide credit card information.

**COOKIES:** We use "cookies" to collect certain bits of technical and navigational information that allows us to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart and tells us how you use our site (such as pages visited, etc).

We do not collect or store personally identifiable information.

**INFORMATION SHARING:** We only share information under the following circumstances:

\--We may share the information submitted under your account with our business partners for order fulfillment and warranty issues (examples would be: processing your credit card information with VISA or Mastercard services or submitting your package/tracking information to UPS or the Postal Service as we process your order, etc).
