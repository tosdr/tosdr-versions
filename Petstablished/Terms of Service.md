Welcome to PerfectPetMatch.com LLC (doing business as Wagtopia) ("Wagtopia").These terms of use (these "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Wagtopia website (www.wagtopia.com) (the "Site"), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through the Site, or remotely through the Wagtopia widget software, or otherwise offered by Wagtopia including Petstablished, our shelter and rescue management software (collectively, the "Services"), so please read them carefully before using the Services.

By using the Services or otherwise accessing the Site and/or by creating an account with us, you agree to be bound and abide by these Terms, our Privacy Policy and other applicable terms and documents referenced herein, which are incorporated herein by reference. You also represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Wagtopia and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. If you are using the Services on behalf of an animal welfare organization ("AWO"), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the AWO to these Terms, in which case the term "you" shall refer to both you and the AWO. If you do not meet these requirements, you must not access or use the Services.

**1\. Description of Services**

Wagtopia provides an online platform and software that (1) enables AWOs to more effectively manage their operations (including pet records and information, adoptions, donations, events, staff members, fosters and volunteers) and (2) connects pet lovers with their future pets, as made available by AWOs. In addition, Wagtopia also offers the Wagtopia Marketplace as well as WagtopiaMD both of which fall under these Terms, as well as the additional terms for each respective Service:Wagtopia Marketplace Additional Terms - Purchasers, and WagtopiaMD Additional Terms.Wagtopia also offers ancillary Services, such as sale of microchips and registration of microchipped pets. AWOs that participate in the Wagtopia microchip program are provided with access to Wagtopia software at no cost. The Services are more fully described on the Site.Wagtopia provides a venue for pet lovers to learn about animals available at AWOs for adopting or fostering, and helps facilitate the adoption/fostering process. However, Wagtopia itself does not own or shelter any pets and is not directly involved in pet adoption or fostering proceedings conducted between pet lovers and AWOs. Furthermore, Wagtopia does not independently verify the accuracy of any pet listings or any other information posted on the Site by either AWOs or pet lovers, including adoption profiles.

With that understanding, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

* Pet adoptions are subject to certain legal requirements. By providing the Services, Wagtopia makes no representations whatsoever regarding any AWO's compliance with applicable laws or regulations or with regard to any pet lover’s legal capacity to complete a pet adoption or any other transaction between pet lover and AWO.

We automatically bill your Payment Method each Membership Term on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month or year, we may bill your Payment Method on such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your Wagtopia membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership.

Any capitalized terms not defined in these Additional Terms shall have the meaning as set forth in the Terms.

**1\. The Wagtopia Marketplace.**

**1.1    Description of Services.** The Wagtopia Marketplace provides a venue for users to purchase certain pet products, goods, services and any other pet-related items ("Products") as may be listed by Sellers.

**1.2 Content, Pricing and Accuracy.**All features, content, availability, specifications, products and prices of Products described or depicted on the Wagtopia Marketplace are subject to change at any time without notice. The inclusion of any Products on the Wagtopia Marketplace at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these Products will be available at any time. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the Products and ensure that information on the Wagtopia Marketplace is complete, accurate and up-to-date. Despite our efforts, the information on the Wagtopia Marketplace may occasionally be inaccurate, mispriced, incomplete or out-of-date. We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on the Wagtopia Marketplace. For example, Products included on the Wagtopia Marketplace may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may carry a different price than what is stated on the Wagtopia Marketplace. We reserve the right to correct any errors from time to time and we will not be obliged to supply the Products at the incorrect price, or in accordance with the incorrect description. In the event of a pricing error or discrepancy on the Wagtopia Marketplace with respect to Products, we reserve the right to cancel any orders (or partial orders) for such Products. We will (at our discretion) either cancel your order and refund the price you have paid or use reasonable efforts to contact you and ask you whether you wish to continue with the order at the correct price or correct description. The inclusion of any Products on the Wagtopia Marketplace at a particular time does not imply or warrant that such Products will be available at any other time.

**1.3****Shipping.**When a Product order is placed, it will be shipped to the address designated by you, as long as such shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Wagtopia Marketplace. Multiple items placed with separate vendors may incur multiple shipping costs per individual Seller.REMINDER, a complete and accurate address is critical for successful delivery. An incomplete or inaccurate address will cause significant delays and loss of shipments. Unfortunately we’re not able to accept liability for lost Products if you input an incorrect or incomplete address, and you will not be refunded in this event. Any recovery, re-stocking, re-shipments, or other costs related to your entry of incorrect or incomplete addresses will be at your expense.

**1.4 Confirmation, Seller Cancellation and Coupons.** While it is our practice to confirm online orders via email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order nor our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product.

We also may require additional information and/or verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.For products purchased from the Wagtopia Marketplace using a credit card, an authorization may be placed on your credit card when you place an order. Partial shipment or partial cancellation of orders may occur.

**1.5 Purchaser Changes and/or Cancellation.**In most cases, once an order is placed, it is final and cannot be canceled or changed.This is because the fulfilment process begins immediately for most orders.You may nonetheless request a change from the Seller, and the Seller will notify you if it is possible to cancel or make basic modifications to your order (for example, for Products with longer lead-times).Basic modifications would include changing the size or color of an item, or making a minor update to a delivery address. It is not possible to change one item to another where the value is different, or to change the delivery address entirely from one address to another. If the Seller is unable to cancel or amend your order, (for example if your order has already been shipped), then you will need to initiate a return after your receipt of the order.For the purpose of clarity, personalized Product purchases are final, and not eligible for returns.

**1.6 License.** Purchaser grants Wagtopia a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicensable, irrevocable, right and license to (i) collect and analyze data related to the provision of its Services and the provision, use and data regarding performance of and various aspects of the Wagtopia Marketplace ("Performance Data") and use such information internally to troubleshoot, improve and enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic, security and corrective purposes, including by aggregating and anonymizing data with data from other users or sources to create benchmarks or other statistical information ("Benchmarks"), and (ii) use and disclose the Benchmarks and Performance Data in connection with Company’s business, products and services, provided that any such use and disclosure is aggregated and anonymized and does not reveal any personally identifiable information or the identity of Purchaser and/or any individual.

As with any online health service, there are potential risks associated with use. When using this service, you understand the additional risks of telehealth and waive any liability to Wagtopia or the veterinarian. These risks include but may not be limited to:

* information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate health care decision making by the veterinarian;

* lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

By subscribing to the Emergency Fund, you acknowledge and agree that:

(**a**) There is a 14-day mandatory wait period upon starting your WagtopiaMD Subscription before the Emergency Fund is available to you (the "Wait Period"). If a veterinary doctor determines you are having a life-threatening emergency and need immediate care for your pet before the expiration of the Wait Period, the Emergency Fund will not yet be at your disposal. You will also be subject to the Wait Period again if you cancel and reactivate your Account.

(**b**) The Emergency Fund is only available to you if your Subscription Fees are made continuously and without interruption. If the payment method we have on file for you fails, you will lose access to the Emergency Fund. If you cancel your Account, you will lose access to the Emergency Fund.

(**c**) If you suspect your pet is having a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate care, you must consult our veterinary doctors before gaining access to the Emergency Fund. All emergencies must be assessed and referred by one of our veterinary doctors through the WagtopiaMD platform. A live face to face video call or a video recording is mandatory to determine if it is a life-threatening emergency or not. You cannot access the Emergency Fund if the pet has been admitted for emergency care prior to contacting one of our veterinary doctors as set forth above.

(**d**) The Emergency Fund only pays for the initial emergency care. All other follow up care is at the expense of the pet owner. Additionally, the Emergency Fund will not cover additional costs associated with euthanasia, such as cremation or memorabilia.

(**e**) The Emergency Fund is restricted to a one-time annual pay-out in an amount not to exceed $3,000, regardless of the amount of the emergency. In other words, you are only entitled to access the Emergency Fund one time during each year of your Subscription, even if the emergency is less than the $3,000 limit.

(**f**) You have up to a maximum of 4 hours to take your pet to an emergency clinic or any veterinary clinic of your choice after being referred by our vets. If you exceed the 4-hour period to use the Emergency Fund, the funds will not be released for your pet's care.

(**g**) You will not qualify for the Emergency Fund if our veterinary doctors have previously recommended a visit to your vet clinic and you failed to comply. Waiting to take your pet in for medical care can result in an unnecessary emergency for your pet and we do not support medical negligence.

(**h**) The Emergency Fund only covers your cats and dogs. No other pets are entitled to participate in the Emergency Fund. You may be required to provide proof of ownership of your pet in the form of a pet license or registration.

(**i**) You can take your pet to any veterinary clinic located within the United States. Please keep in mind that some clinics require a deposit before accepting your pet for evaluation. WagtopiaMD cannot provide the deposit for you, however, upon receiving the final invoice, the deposit will be included in the final payment issued by WagtopiaMD. This means whatever deposit you left upon checking in will be credited back to your account at the discretion of the clinic.

(**j**) The Emergency Fund is non-transferable to other parties and their pets.

(**k**) We do not cover emergencies associated with breeding or pregnancy issues.

(**l**) In order to gain access to your emergency fund, we require completed profiles for all of your pets with their name, age, weight, breed, and a clear photo. If this information is missing, you will not have access to your emergency fund.
