Welcome to PerfectPetMatch.com LLC (doing business as Wagtopia) (“Wagtopia”)!  Wagtopia understands that privacy and data security are vital concerns to everyone. We respect your privacy and recognize the importance of the information you provide to us. We are committed to protecting your information through our compliance with this Privacy Policy.

When you visit our website (www.wagtopia.com) (the “Site”), create an Account or register with us, or place an order through the Perfectpet Marketplace, we may collect certain information from you. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect when you visit the Site or use the Petstablished services (collectively, our "Services") and our practices for using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By accessing or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. Each time you visit or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning as set forth in the Terms of Use.  This Privacy Policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy below). Your continued use of our Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates. 

Please note that this Policy does not apply to your use of third-party sites, services, or applications you may access through the Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties for more information regarding their privacy practices.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

We collect several types of information from and about users of our Site and Services. We gather information in the following ways: voluntary registration, voluntary submissions, cookie technology, and location data. 

**Information You Provide to Us.**

* **1\.     Registration**. When you register to use our Services, we collect information that helps us identify you and helps us to administer your account. The more information you provide, the better we can customize our services and your experience to suit your needs and preferences. We collect information you provide directly to us when using the Services. For example, we collect information when you sign up for an Account, complete a form, place an order, participate in any interactive features of the Services, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, mailing and billing address and payment information, and any other information you choose to provide.  For purposes of registering and using the Services, we collect certain information that can identify you, such as your name and contact information (email, address and phone number)  (“Personal Information”) We will never sell, rent, or trade Personal Information and will only use it, as needed, to provide the Services and/or fulfill the orders requested by you. If you choose not to provide information that is necessary to provide the Services, you may not be able to use certain aspects or all of the Services.  Wagtopia discloses Personal Information only to those of its employees, contractors, purchasers, sellers, and/or affiliated organizations that (i) need to know the information in order to process it on yours and our behalf, and (ii) that have agreed in writing to non-disclosure restrictions at least as strong as those herein.  Depending on the nature of your inquiry or activities on the Services, we may also ask for other information relevant to your use of the Services.
    * **Microchip registration**. In addition to the above, if you sign up or register your pet in our microchip database, you understand and agree that personal information you provide will be held in a database created and operated by us. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but we do require an email address to be able to register. We only return certain contact and other relevant information about you and your pet. By signing up and including your information on the microchip registry, you agree and understand that people who enter the microchip number will be able to view the contact information you provide (even if those people enter the wrong microchip number that happens to be yours). You are responsible for only including information you are comfortable with others being able to access, and we will not be in any way responsible or liable for persons receiving your information that you provided through the microchip registry.
* **2\.     User Contributions**. The Site may contain video postings, message boards, chat rooms, personal web pages or profiles, forums, bulletin boards, and other interactive features that allow you to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit to other users content or materials on or through the Site (collectively, “User Contributions”). All information you provide may become public on the Site, including any partner or affiliate pages. Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Services with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 
* **3\.     Payment**. The Company uses Stripe as its third-party payment processor to process credit cards and electronic payments securely for its users. Accordingly, the Company will not store payment information in its system. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Services will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of Stripe and your credit card issuer in addition to those terms specified herein.

You may send us an e-mail at [support@petstablished.com](mailto:support@petstablished.com) to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. You have the right to request what Personal Information we hold about you subject to our right to identity verification. If you request a copy of your data, we may charge you a fee, except where this is not permissible under applicable law. 

Whenever you have given us your consent to use your Personal Information, you have the right to change your mind at any time and withdraw that consent. 

In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your Personal Information if it is inaccurate or needs to be updated. You may also have the right to request the deletion of your Personal Information, however this may not be always possible due to legal requirements and other obligations to keep such data. If we are asked to delete your data, we may keep some minimal information about you to be able to demonstrate that we have fulfilled our obligations.  In addition, we cannot delete all of your Personal Information except by also deleting your user Account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

**California privacy rights AND NOTICES**

**California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civil Code § 1798.100 et seq., (“CCPA”)**

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. 

Wagtopia shall comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civil Code § 1798.100 et seq., (“CCPA”), which may be amended from time to time.  Per the terms of the CCPA, Wagtopia is a Service Provider and not a Third Party as described in the CCPA. Therefore, Wagtopia shall not:

* Sell the Personal Information.
* Retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the Services or for a Business Purpose. Specifically, Wagtopia shall not retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information for a Commercial Purpose.
* Retain, use, or disclose the Personal Information outside of the direct business relationship between Wagtopia and its users.

Notwithstanding anything in the Terms of Service or any related order form or other document, the parties acknowledge and agree that a user’s provision of Personal Information is not part of and explicitly excluded from the exchange of consideration, or any other thing of value, between the parties.

You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information that we have collected from you. However, we are not required to comply with a request to delete, if it is necessary for us to retain the personal information in order to:

* Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a product that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
* Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
* Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
* Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).
* Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
* Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
* Comply with legal obligations.
* Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

If you are a California resident and would like to request information or exercise your rights under the CCPA, please submit your request in an email to [support@petstablished.com](mailto:support@petstablished.com). Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an “authorized agent”), may make the requests set forth above. The request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. In addition, you should provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal information or an authorized representative of that person.   

We will respond to consumer requests in a reasonably timely manner. If we require extra time to respond, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. In order to protect the security of your personal information, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. The method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity, and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion. Generally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period). If we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.  
  

We do not sell your Personal Information or any information that may be used to identify you.

**RETENTION**

We will retain your Personal Information for the period of time that is necessary to fulfil the original purposes for which it has been collected. Please keep in mind that, in certain cases, a longer retention period may be required or permitted by law or to allow us to pursue our business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, enforce our agreements or resolve any dispute. 

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

* Time needed to provide you with our Services or to operate our business.
* Whether your Account with us is active.  You may contact us to make your Account inactive at any time. 
* Legal, contractual, or similar obligations to retain your data, such as mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of contract or litigation. 

Please note that we are not responsible for storing any information that you provide to us or for any content or information that we provide to you. You are solely responsible for retaining backup files of any information and content that you provide or receive in connection with the Services.

We will also require you to submit a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
    * **For requests to delete,** we will verify your request to a "reasonable degree" or a "reasonably high degree of certainty" depending on the sensitivity of the personal information and the risk of harm to the consumer posed by unauthorized deletion.
    
    We will use the personal information you provide in a request only for purposes of verifying your identity or authority to make the request.
    
4.  Response Timing and Format
    
    We will respond to a verifiable request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt, and will notify you within those forty-five (45) days if we require more time to respond and the reasons for the additional time.  If you have an Account with us, we will deliver our written response to that Account. If you do not have an Account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  (Note that the law prohibits us from disclosing at any time a consumer's Social Security number, driver's license number or other government-issued identification number, financial account number, any health insurance or medical identification number, an Account password, security questions and answers, or any unique biometric data.)  If we cannot comply with a request or a portion of the request, we will include the reasons in our response. If we deny your request on the basis that it is impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, we will explain our reasons, such as the data is not in a searchable or readily accessible format, is maintained for only legal or compliance purposes, or is not sold or used for any commercial purpose and our inability to disclose it, delete or correct it would not impact you in any material manner.
    
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
    
    \*Please note that in certain cases we may collect your personal information as a service provider (as opposed to a business, as those terms are defined in the CPRA) pursuant to a contract we have with a commercial client (the CPRA business) to provide a service. In such a case, we are required to collect and process your information only based on the instructions received from the business. Should you direct your requests to exercise your rights to us, we may be required to share your request with the business, who is the party responsible under the CPRA for receiving, verifying and responding to your requests, or we may direct you to make your request directly to the business.
