This Privacy Notice also explains how we may use and disclose such information, as well as your choices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

Information We Collect
----------------------

### Information You Provide

We collect certain personal information from you when you choose to provide it to us. This may include when you use certain features on our Sites register for an account on one or more of our Sites; make a purchase; sign up for a newsletter or one of our email lists; use our services; participate in a contest, sweepstakes, game, survey, or promotion; request information from us; or otherwise contact us. The personal information we collect may include your name, birthday or age, telephone number, and e-mail address. If you purchase products or services from Kraft Heinz, we may also request your credit/debit card number or other financial information, along with billing information, so we can fulfill your order or request.

We don’t require you to register or provide personal information to view our Sites or access much of its content, such as our many delicious recipes. However, you may be required to provide certain personal information to create a Site account, use certain features, or receive certain offers. For example, when you participate in certain interactive features on our Sites, such as using our recipe exchange, recipe ratings, and product ratings and reviews, you may also provide us with certain information like your e-mail address, nickname, city and state or province of residence, or submit content, such as recipes, ratings, comments, or pictures to the Site.

If you use a third-party login to create your account (such as Facebook Connect or a Google account), sign into our Sites or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party based on your registration and privacy settings on those third-party websites.

### Loyalty Programs

We may collect your personal information when you choose to join our loyalty programs or promotional campaigns where we aim to enhance your engagement with us. By participating in these programs, we may gather certain information from you. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, contact details, images of receipts, purchase history, referral details, demographic information, preferences, and program activity information such as points earned, rewards redeemed, and engagement with program features. We collect this data through various means, including contests, competitions, receipt scanning, quizzes, gamified experiences, and surveys. The personal information collected through loyalty programs is used to understand our customers’ preferences and needs, to personalize the content we may send to you, to provide customized rewards and offers, to give exclusive access to digital content, products, or experiences to qualified members, to improve our product and services, and to facilitate communications. We may share the personal information collected through these programs with our service providers, as described in the How We Disclose Your Information section below. When you sign up for a loyalty program, we will provide you with information about our program partners and the benefits you can earn by participating in the program. If you submit a deletion request for your personal information, we may be unable to provide you with loyalty program benefits because we need your personal information to process your loyalty program membership and to provide you with the benefits associated with your membership.

We may also collect certain information about you automatically when you visit the Site (see Information Collected by Automated Means below) and from other sources (see Information Collected from Other Sources below) and may combine this information with the information you provide to us.

### Information Collected By Automated Means

We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (such as Flash cookies), and other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to our Sites, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements, and to allow us to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information which enables us to improve the Sites and provide you with more relevant content and advertising on our Site and other sites.

For example, through these means, we may automatically collect information such as your browser type, operating system, mobile device type and carrier, device identifier, Internet service provider (“ISP”), Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the country with which your IP address is associated. We may also collect information about your use of and interaction with the Site, such as the webpages viewed, the date and time you visit the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using the Site, the number of times you return to the Site, other click-stream or Site usage data, whether you open, forward, or click-through links, emails, and ads, and other Site usage data. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personal information, for example, helps us to best tailor our Site and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular Site, and to help identify Site features, recipes, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.

When you view the site using a mobile device, in addition to the other information we may collect from your actions, we may collect precise geolocation information where you give permission for us to do so.

We also work with third-party advertisers and ad networks to support our Sites. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (such as Flash cookies) to collect information about you when you visit our Site or other websites, including your IP address, ISP, browser type, and whether you have Flash installed, as well as information about your activities on our Sites and on third-party sites. Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may combine this information with other data, such as demographic data received from third parties to assist in tailoring the advertisements displayed to you. These third-party advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our Site and on other third-party sites, and demographic information, so that the advertising you see on our Site and other sites more closely reflect your interests and needs. For example, if you search for or browse a recipe or product on our Site, you may see an advertisement from a third-party with information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our Site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you have visited in the past.

### Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures

Certain parts of our Site require cookies. You are free to set your Internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, to receive notice when you receive a new cookie, to disable existing cookies, and to omit images (which will disable pixel tags). On your mobile device, you may also adjust your privacy and advertising settings to control whether you want to receive more relevant advertising. By doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Please refer to your Web browser’s or operating system’s website or “Help” section for more information on how to disable your browser or operating system from receiving cookies or controlling your tracking preferences.

We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

### Information Collected From Other Sources

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or social networks that you use to connect with us. This information may include your name, demographic information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media, online activity, and shopping behavior. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our services and products.

How We Use Your Information
---------------------------

We may use the information we collect from and about you for any of the following purposes:

* To provide products or services you have requested;
* To respond to your comments or questions, or contact you if needed while processing a product or service you requested through our Site;
* To improve our Site, products, and services; develop new products or services; and conduct analysis to enhance current products and services;
* To review the usage and operations of our Site and improve our content, products; and services, including contacting you for your opinions on Kraft Heinz products, services, or websites;
* To send you promotional offers, newsletter, materials, and other communications and information about Kraft Heinz, its portfolio of brands, affiliates, and its partners;
* To provide you with content that is customized to your interests, targeted offers, and advertising on the Sites, on third party sites and media platforms, including in social media, or via email;
* To contact you as necessary when you enter a contest, sweepstakes, or game in order to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you if you’re a winner);
* To contact you when necessary;
* To use your data in an aggregated non-specific format for analytical and demographic purposes;
* To address problems with the Site or our business;
* To manage our telecommunications networks;
* To protect the security or integrity of the Site and our business;
* As otherwise described to you at the point of data collection; and
* To use and disclose your credit/debit card information only to process payments and prevent fraud.

Additionally, if you use the Site to connect with third-party services you authorize us to use information from and about you, on your behalf, to interact with these third-party services based on your requests.

We may use your identity, contact, technical, usage, account, and profile data, including identity, contact and profile data we have received from data brokers or aggregators, to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what kinds of products and services may be of interest to you. Combining data from multiple sources in this way is commonly known as “enriching data” or “profile building”. This is how we decide which products, services and offers to include in marketing messages we send. This process may involve automated decision-making to determine which marketing messages will be most meaningful to you based on your interests, preferences, and location. There may also be other instances where we may use your personal information to render a decision based on automated processing of such personal information. If you would not like us to use data from data brokers and aggregators to enrich the data we have collected from you or if you would like to object to automated decision-making or if you would like to submit observations to a member of the personnel of our organization who is in a position to review the decision made by automated means, please contact the Data Privacy Team. We will not use Special Category Data or Sensitive Personal Data in building a profile about you unless you give us your consent to do so.

How We Disclose Your Information
--------------------------------

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our website visitors, except as described in this Notice. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. For California residents, please see “Your California Privacy Rights” below.

We may disclose the information we collect from and about you in the following ways: (1) among Kraft Heinz brands and subsidiaries for the purposes described above; (2) to our third party service providers we have retained to perform a business, professional or technical support functions for us, including to the extent necessary or desirable to help run promotions, fulfill orders, complete your transaction, or provide customer service (these service providers may have access to personal information about our Site visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Kraft Heinz, but they are not authorized by Kraft Heinz to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on Kraft Heinz’s behalf or to comply with legal requirements); (3) as necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others, as permitted by law; (4) if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms of Use or of our rights or the rights of any third party; (5) to respond to judicial process or provide information to law enforcement authorities, regulatory agencies, or other government officials, or otherwise as required by law; and (6) as otherwise described to you in this Notice or at the point of collection.

We share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our identity partners/service providers, including LiveRamp Inc. LiveRamp returns an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising. To opt out of this use, please click [here](https://liveramp.com/opt_out/).

In addition, we may share your email address with our service providers, such as media agencies, to send you interest-based advertising on our behalf. We may also share aggregated or de-identified information about you with our advertising and marketing partners, and third-party media platforms, including social media sites, to allow them to send targeted advertising messages and/or conduct analyses on our behalf. If you wish to stop receiving advertising messages from these third parties, please review the “Your Choices” section below. In addition, you may be able to opt out of these ads by clicking on an icon in the ad or through the privacy settings in each social media platform.

We may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may provide to our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personal information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you consent to such sharing.

During the normal course of our business, Kraft Heinz may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through the Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

Data processing within the Kraft Heinz group of companies may be done via servers located outside of Quebec, Canada, and the United States. Some of our supplier, advertising, or promotional agency service providers as described above may also be located outside of Quebec, Canada, and the United States. As a result, your personal information may be accessible to regulatory authorities in accordance with the laws of other jurisdictions. If you wish more information about Kraft Heinz policies and practices with respect to the transfer and processing of personal information outside of Canada or the United States, please contact us in any of the ways described in the contact section of this Privacy Notice.

Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas. Kraft Heinz cannot control the actions of third parties who may view the Site and use publicly-available information for their own purposes.

### Your Choices

### Children's Information

Kraft Heinz is committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our Sites. While most Kraft Heinz Sites are directed to adults, there are a few other Sites intended for use by children under the age of 13. For Services that are directed to children, we may collect, use, and disclose information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”) and uses terms that are defined in our general Privacy Notice. This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) and outlines our practices regarding children’s personal information.

Where one of our Services is intended for use by a child under the age of 13, we will obtain consent from the person with parental responsibility before we collect personal information where it is required by applicable laws and regulations.

If you are a child under the age of 13, you should review the terms of this Privacy Notice with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them.

Access to certain parts of the Kraft Heinz websites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards are generally limited to users over a certain age.

We sometimes use your personal information to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions.

### How We Protect and Retain Your Information

The security of your information is important to us. We have taken certain administrative, technical, and physical steps to safeguard the information we collect from and about our customers and Site visitors against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While we make every effort to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our security measures.

Personal information is maintained on our servers or those of our service providers and is accessible to authorized employees, representatives and agents who require access for the purposes described in this notice. We retain personal information in accordance with our record retention policies. Retention periods are set taking into account the purpose for which the personal information was collected, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate need to retain business records for reasonable periods.

### Updates To This Privacy Notice

We may change or update all or certain portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. When we do, we will post the revised Privacy Notice on the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of the revised Privacy Notice means you accept these changes. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the notice. If we make any material changes, we will provide appropriate notice to you. We will indicate the notice’s effective date on the first page of the notice.

### Your Rights

### Additional Information Regarding Data Sharing and Cookies

We also work with third-party advertisers and ad networks to support our Sites. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (such as Flash cookies) to collect information about you when you visit our Site or other websites, including your IP address, ISP, browser type, and whether you have Flash installed, as well as information about your activities on our Sites and on third-party sites. Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may combine this information with other data, such as demographic data received from third parties to assist in tailoring the advertisements displayed to you. These third-party advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our Site and on other third-party sites, and demographic information, so that the advertising you see on our Site and other sites more closely reflect your interests and needs. For example, if you search for or browse a recipe or product on our Site, you may see an advertisement from a third-party with information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our Site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you have visited in the past.

Notice of Financial Incentive
-----------------------------

We may offer you certain benefits through loyalty programs, coupons, discounts, and similar programs (each a “Program” and, collectively, “Programs”). If you participate in a Program, we may collect personal information from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, and other relevant information. As a result, the Program may constitute a “financial incentive” under California law and may be subject to additional terms and conditions which will be provided to you during the Program sign-up process. You can opt-in to participate in a Program by following the Program registration guidelines. You have the right to withdraw from a Program at any point, subject to applicable law, the Program terms and conditions, and our Privacy Notice, by following the instructions provided. Typically, we do not put a monetary value on your personal information. However, California law requires we provide a valuation of personal information collected in connection with a financial incentive. The value of the personal information you provide while participating in a Program is based upon our reasonable and good-faith estimation of the value of such information, which considers, without limitation, the value and purpose of the Program, associated expenses, the type and usage of the collected personal information, and the number of individuals who participated in the Program.
