We reserve the right to amend this Agree­ment at any time by noti­fy­ing you as pro­vid­ed in this Agree­ment, pro­vid­ed that no notice shall be required for non-sub­stan­tive changes to the Agree­ment. If we sub­stan­tive­ly amend this Agree­ment, we will give you at least sev­en (7) days notice before the changes take effect, dur­ing which peri­od of time you may reject the changes by ter­mi­nat­ing your account and imme­di­ate­ly dis­con­tin­u­ing use of the Ser­vice. Your con­tin­ued use of the Ser­vice after any such change con­sti­tutes your accep­tance of the new Terms of Use.  If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or con­tin­ue to access) the Ser­vice.  This Agree­ment applies to all vis­i­tors, users, and oth­ers who access the Ser­vice (“Users”).

You are sole­ly respon­si­ble for your inter­ac­tions with oth­er Open Cul­ture Users. We reserve the right, but have no oblig­a­tion, to mon­i­tor dis­putes between you and oth­er Users.  Open Cul­ture shall have no lia­bil­i­ty for your inter­ac­tions with oth­er Users, or for any User’s action or inac­tion.

**2.) User Con­tent**

Some areas of the Ser­vice allow Users to post con­tent such as com­ments, ques­tions, and oth­er con­tent or infor­ma­tion (any such mate­ri­als a User sub­mits, posts, dis­plays, or oth­er­wise makes avail­able on the Ser­vice “User Con­tent”).  You retain own­er­ship of your User Con­tent.

You agree not to post User Con­tent that: (i) may cre­ate a risk of harm, loss, phys­i­cal or men­tal injury, emo­tion­al dis­tress, death, dis­abil­i­ty, dis­fig­ure­ment, or phys­i­cal or men­tal ill­ness to you, to any oth­er per­son, or to any ani­mal; (ii) may cre­ate a risk of any oth­er loss or dam­age to any per­son or prop­er­ty; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit chil­dren by expos­ing them to inap­pro­pri­ate con­tent, ask­ing for per­son­al­ly iden­ti­fi­able details or oth­er­wise; (iv) may con­sti­tute or con­tribute to a crime or tort; (v) con­tains any infor­ma­tion or con­tent that we deem to be unlaw­ful, harm­ful, abu­sive, racial­ly or eth­ni­cal­ly offen­sive, defam­a­to­ry, infring­ing, inva­sive of per­son­al pri­va­cy or pub­lic­i­ty rights, harass­ing, humil­i­at­ing to oth­er peo­ple (pub­licly or oth­er­wise), libelous, threat­en­ing, pro­fane, or oth­er­wise objec­tion­able; (vi) con­tains any infor­ma­tion or con­tent that is ille­gal (includ­ing, with­out lim­i­ta­tion, the dis­clo­sure of insid­er infor­ma­tion under secu­ri­ties law or of anoth­er party’s trade secrets); (vii) con­tains any infor­ma­tion or con­tent that you do not have a right to make avail­able under any law or under con­trac­tu­al or fidu­cia­ry rela­tion­ships; or (viii) con­tains any infor­ma­tion or con­tent that you know is not cor­rect and cur­rent.  You agree that any User Con­tent that you post does not and will not vio­late third-par­ty rights of any kind, includ­ing with­out lim­i­ta­tion any Intel­lec­tu­al Prop­er­ty Rights (as defined below) or rights of pri­va­cy.  To the extent that your User Con­tent con­tains music, you here­by rep­re­sent that you are the own­er of all the copy­right rights, includ­ing with­out lim­i­ta­tion the per­for­mance, mechan­i­cal, and sound record­ings rights, with respect to each and every musi­cal com­po­si­tion (includ­ing lyrics) and sound record­ing con­tained in such User Con­tent and have the pow­er to grant the license grant­ed below.  Open Cul­ture reserves the right, but is not oblig­at­ed, to reject, mod­i­fy and/or remove any User Con­tent that Open Cul­ture believes, in its sole dis­cre­tion, vio­lates these pro­vi­sions.  You under­stand that pub­lish­ing your User Con­tent on the Ser­vice is not a sub­sti­tute for reg­is­ter­ing it with the U.S. Copy­right Office, the Writer’s Guild of Amer­i­ca, or any oth­er rights orga­ni­za­tion.

For the pur­pos­es of this Agree­ment, “Intel­lec­tu­al Prop­er­ty Rights” means all patent rights, copy­right rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of pub­lic­i­ty, trade­mark, trade dress and ser­vice mark rights, good­will, trade secret rights and oth­er intel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty rights as may now exist or here­after come into exis­tence, and all appli­ca­tions there­fore and reg­is­tra­tions, renewals and exten­sions there­of, under the laws of any state, coun­try, ter­ri­to­ry or oth­er juris­dic­tion.

In con­nec­tion with your User Con­tent, you affirm, rep­re­sent and war­rant the fol­low­ing:

A.        You have the writ­ten con­sent of each and every iden­ti­fi­able nat­ur­al per­son in the User Con­tent to use such person’s name or like­ness in the man­ner con­tem­plat­ed by the Ser­vice and this Agree­ment, and each such per­son has released you from any lia­bil­i­ty that may arise in rela­tion to such use.

B.        Your User Con­tent and Open Culture’s use there­of as con­tem­plat­ed by this Agree­ment and the Ser­vice will not vio­late any law or infringe any rights of any third par­ty, includ­ing but not lim­it­ed to any Intel­lec­tu­al Prop­er­ty Rights and pri­va­cy rights.

D.        To the best of your knowl­edge, all your User Con­tent and oth­er infor­ma­tion that you pro­vide to us is truth­ful and accu­rate.

Open Cul­ture takes no respon­si­bil­i­ty and assumes no lia­bil­i­ty for any User Con­tent that you or any oth­er User or third par­ty posts or sends over the Ser­vice.  You shall be sole­ly respon­si­ble for your User Con­tent and the con­se­quences of post­ing or pub­lish­ing it, and you agree that we are only act­ing as a pas­sive con­duit for your online dis­tri­b­u­tion and pub­li­ca­tion of your User Con­tent.

You acknowl­edge that Open Cul­ture may from time to time issue upgrad­ed ver­sions of the Mobile Soft­ware, and may auto­mat­i­cal­ly elec­tron­i­cal­ly upgrade the ver­sion of the Mobile Soft­ware that you are using on your mobile device.

The Mobile Soft­ware may not be export­ed or re-export­ed to cer­tain coun­tries or those per­sons or enti­ties pro­hib­it­ed from receiv­ing exports from the Unit­ed States.  In addi­tion, the Mobile Soft­ware may be sub­ject to the import and export laws of oth­er coun­tries.  You agree to com­ply with all Unit­ed States and for­eign laws relat­ed to use of the Mobile Soft­ware and the Open Cul­ture Ser­vice.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF OPEN CULTURE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.  THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

The Ser­vice is con­trolled and oper­at­ed from its facil­i­ties in the Unit­ed States.  Open Cul­ture makes no rep­re­sen­ta­tions that the Ser­vice is appro­pri­ate or avail­able for use in oth­er loca­tions. Those who access or use the Ser­vice from oth­er juris­dic­tions do so at their own voli­tion and are entire­ly respon­si­ble for com­pli­ance with all applic­a­ble Unit­ed States and local laws and reg­u­la­tions, includ­ing but not lim­it­ed to export and import reg­u­la­tions.  You may not use the Ser­vice if you are a res­i­dent of a coun­try embar­goed by the Unit­ed States, or are a for­eign per­son or enti­ty blocked or denied by the Unit­ed States gov­ern­ment.  Unless oth­er­wise explic­it­ly stat­ed, all mate­ri­als found on the Ser­vice are sole­ly direct­ed to indi­vid­u­als, com­pa­nies, or oth­er enti­ties locat­ed in the Unit­ed States.

**13.) Assign­ment**

This Agree­ment, and any rights and licens­es grant­ed here­un­der, may not be trans­ferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Open Cul­ture with­out restric­tion. Any attempt­ed trans­fer or assign­ment in vio­la­tion here­of shall be null and void.

**14.) Gen­er­al**

A.      Gov­ern­ing Law.  You agree that: (i) the Ser­vice shall be deemed sole­ly based in Cal­i­for­nia; and (ii) the Ser­vice shall be deemed a pas­sive one that does not give rise to per­son­al juris­dic­tion over Open Cul­ture, either spe­cif­ic or gen­er­al, in juris­dic­tions oth­er than Cal­i­for­nia.  This Agree­ment shall be gov­erned by the inter­nal sub­stan­tive laws of the State of Cal­i­for­nia, with­out respect to its con­flict of laws prin­ci­ples. The appli­ca­tion of the Unit­ed Nations Con­ven­tion on Con­tracts for the Inter­na­tion­al Sale of Goods is express­ly exclud­ed.  Except as oth­er­wise agreed between the par­ties or as described in Sec­tion 17.B. below, any claim or dis­pute between you and Open Cul­ture that aris­es in whole or in part from the Ser­vice shall be decid­ed exclu­sive­ly by a court of com­pe­tent juris­dic­tion locat­ed in San­ta Clara Coun­ty, Cal­i­for­nia, unless sub­mit­ted to arbi­tra­tion as set forth in the fol­low­ing para­graph.

B.        Arbi­tra­tion.  For any claim (exclud­ing claims for injunc­tive or oth­er equi­table relief) under this Agree­ment where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the par­ty request­ing relief may elect to resolve the dis­pute through bind­ing non-appear­ance-based arbi­tra­tion. The par­ty elect­ing such arbi­tra­tion shall ini­ti­ate the arbi­tra­tion through an estab­lished alter­na­tive dis­pute res­o­lu­tion (“ADR”) provider mutu­al­ly agreed upon by the par­ties. The ADR provider and the par­ties must com­ply with the fol­low­ing rules: a) the arbi­tra­tion shall be con­duct­ed by tele­phone, online and/or be sole­ly based on writ­ten sub­mis­sions, as select­ed by the par­ty ini­ti­at­ing the arbi­tra­tion; b) the arbi­tra­tion shall not involve any per­son­al appear­ance by the par­ties or wit­ness­es unless oth­er­wise mutu­al­ly agreed by the par­ties; and c) any judg­ment on the award ren­dered by the arbi­tra­tor may be entered in any court of com­pe­tent juris­dic­tion.

C.        Noti­fi­ca­tion Pro­ce­dures.  Open Cul­ture may pro­vide noti­fi­ca­tions, whether such noti­fi­ca­tions are required by law or are for mar­ket­ing or oth­er busi­ness relat­ed pur­pos­es, to you via email notice, writ­ten or hard copy notice, or through post­ing of such notice on our web­site, as deter­mined by Open Cul­ture in our sole dis­cre­tion. Open Cul­ture reserves the right to deter­mine the form and means of pro­vid­ing noti­fi­ca­tions to our Users, pro­vid­ed that you may opt out of cer­tain means of noti­fi­ca­tion as described in this Agree­ment.  Open Cul­ture is not respon­si­ble for any auto­mat­ic fil­ter­ing you or your net­work provider may apply to email noti­fi­ca­tions we send to the email address you pro­vide us.  We rec­om­mend that you add [mail@openculture.com](mailto:mail@openculture.com) to your email address book to help ensure you receive email noti­fi­ca­tions from us.

D.        Entire Agreement/Severability.  This Agree­ment, togeth­er with any amend­ments and any addi­tion­al agree­ments you may enter into with Open Cul­ture in con­nec­tion with the Ser­vice, shall con­sti­tute the entire agree­ment between you and Open Cul­ture con­cern­ing the Ser­vice.  If any pro­vi­sion of this Agree­ment is deemed invalid by a court of com­pe­tent juris­dic­tion, the inva­lid­i­ty of such pro­vi­sion shall not affect the valid­i­ty of the remain­ing pro­vi­sions of this Agree­ment, which shall remain in full force and effect.

E.         No Waiv­er.  No waiv­er of any term of this Agree­ment shall be deemed a fur­ther or con­tin­u­ing waiv­er of such term or any oth­er term, and Open Culture’s fail­ure to assert any right or pro­vi­sion under this Agree­ment shall not con­sti­tute a waiv­er of such right or pro­vi­sion.
