What information we collect and how
-----------------------------------

The information we collect via the website may include:

* Any personal details you knowingly provide us with through forms on our website, such as your name, address and telephone number.
    
* Your preferences and use of email subscription, recorded by emails we send you. For example, if you have selected to receive email updates on products and offers.
    
* Your IP Address. This is a numeric address unique to your computer that is recorded by our web server when you request any page or component on the website. This information is used to monitor usage of the website.
    
* 'Cookies' - data recorded by the website that allows us to recognise you and your preferred settings so that you don't need to re-enter information on return visits to the site. Such data is saved locally on your computer through the use of cookies. You can configure your browser to reject cookies or to warn you before downloading them.
    

Under no circumstances will we hold sensitive payment details such as your card number, expiry date or security code. All transactions are handled through our accredited payment bureau, Opayo.

The information we collect during product registration and usage:

Some of our desktop software collects anonymous usage statistics. You can turn this setting off during installation or in the program's settings after installation.

When you activate our desktop software, you can choose to provide your contact details (which may be personal information) for product registration.

Your product registration details will be kept for up to two years after update support for that version of the product ends. Your product registration details will only ever be used to identify you as the owner of the product, and only then when there is a good reason for doing so; for example, to enable you to qualify for a discount when you upgrade from a previous version of the product but did not purchase the previous version directly from Widgit.

You can access, edit, delete or request a copy of your product registration details by contacting Widgit. You can also ask us to restrict how your product registration details are processed. If you want to access, edit, delete, restrict or request a copy of your product registration details then you will need to provide your product key and some of your registration details to confirm that you are the registered product owner.

What we do with your information
--------------------------------

Any personal data we collect will be used in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation in addition to all applicable law concerning the processing of personal data and privacy. If you have opted to be kept informed of any of our products or services, we will use your email address in order to send you that information. In such a case you will always be offered the option to opt in/out of further communication.

We will only use your personal data when we have a lawful basis for doing so. Typically, we will only use your personal data for the following reasons:

* To process your order and to provide after sales service. If your order requires shipping, we may pass your details to a courier service to deliver the products you have purchased.
    
* If you have opted to be kept informed of any of our products or services, we will use your email address in order to send you that information. In such a case you will always be offered the option to opt in or out of further communication. We use [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) to process our mailing lists.
    
* Where it's necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party, and where your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
    
* Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
    

We have categorised the data (including personal data) that we use as follows:

| Marketing - when we suggest products or services that may be of interest to you | Identity, Contact, Communication | Legitimate Interest (e.g. to develop our products and services and grow our business) |
| Analytics - when we use statistics and analysis to help us improve the website | Technical, Activity | Legitimate Interest (e.g. to learn how customers use the website so that we can improve and develop our services, and to inform our marketing strategy) |

  
If we need to use your personal data for another purpose, we will try to ensure that it's compatible with the purposes described here. If it isn't completely compatible then we will notify you by updating this policy, explaining the legal basis for the new purpose.

Security
--------

We have security measures in place to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, disclosed, used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We also limit access to your data to the employees and third parties that need access to it.

All Widgit staff with access to your data are subject to a duty of confidence and have been trained in privacy awareness and the handling of personal data.

Data Retention (How long we keep your personal data for)

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your personal data (for more information, see 'Your other rights').

Your right to object
--------------------

You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and you feel that it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Your other rights
-----------------

You have certain rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. If you wish to exercise any of the rights described here, please contact us using the details in "Important information and who we are".

**Request access to your personal data**  
You can ask for a copy of the personal data we hold about you to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you**  
You can ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**Request erasure of your personal data**  
You can ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see "Your right to object"), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with applicable law. Note that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which you will be informed of, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**Request restriction of processing of your personal data**  
You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data:

1. if you want us to establish the data's accuracy
2. where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it
3. where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims
4. when you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party**  
You can ask us to provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Withdraw consent at any time**  
If we are relying on consent to process your personal data then you can withdraw that consent at any time. This does not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
