****1\. Introduction****  

Welcome to VOCOlinc.com (the “Service”). These Terms of Use constitute a legal agreement (the “Agreement” or “Terms of Use”) between VOCOlinc Trading LLC and/or its affiliates (“we” or “us”) and you that governs your use of the Service and purchase and use of any VOCOlinc products (“Products”) through the Service. By using the Service, you accept these Terms of Use in full. If you disagree with these Terms of Use or any part of these Terms of Use, you must not use the Service.

As explained more fully in the Privacy Policy, the Service uses Cookies to collect certain information from you. By using the Service and agreeing to these Terms of Use, you consent to our use of Cookies in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy.

By accessing and/or using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age, and are otherwise legally qualified to enter into and form contracts under applicable law.

****4\. Purchases & Payments****

If you purchase a Product through the Service, you will be required to provide your billing and shipping information as well as information regarding your credit or debit card (each, a “Payment Card”) so that we may charge you for the costs and fees associated with your purchase.

Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from us, we will send you an email confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation Email").
