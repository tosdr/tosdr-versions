You understand that any and all comments, information, quotes, links, text, messages, or other materials posted by a User (“User Content”), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility and property of the person from which such User Content originated. This means that you, and not Epoch Times, are entirely responsible for all User Content that you share, post, or upload via the Services.

Epoch Times does not control the User Content posted via the Services by you or other Users and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of such User Content. Epoch Times is not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other User.

We have the right to:

(i). Remove or refuse to post any User Content for any or no reason at our sole discretion.  
(ii). Take any action with respect to any User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate at our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Content violates the Terms of Service Agreement, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or could create liability for Epoch Times.  
(iii). Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Services.

YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS EPOCH TIMES FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY EPOCH TIMES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY EPOCH TIMES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

However, we cannot review all material before it is posted on the Services and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions.

10\. USER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD, AND SECURITY.
------------------------------------------

Users have the option of creating an account with Epoch Times to access certain features and content of our Sites, and receive other Services. Once you become a user and establish an account with Epoch Times, you shall receive a password and an account. You must keep your account and password confidential, and are entirely responsible if you do not maintain the confidentiality of your password and account.

Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You may change your password at any time (to do so, go to the user profile menu option within your account). You may also set up a new account and close an old one at your convenience. You agree to immediately notify Epoch Times of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known to You. We have the right to disable any username, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time at our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of this Agreement.

11\. PAYMENTS.
--------------

All payments through our Sites or other transactions formed through the Services, or resulting from visits made by you, are governed by the following payment terms:

**(a) Payments.** When you process a transaction or when you purchase a subscription (weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually), you agree that you are authorizing payments and recurring payments, which will be made to The Epoch Times by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by The Epoch Times.

The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your account was registered.

All subscriptions renew automatically and the payment will be due and charged at the beginning of each billing cycle.  All payments are final and non-refundable. You must terminate your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged for your Services.

If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar payment method is rejected or denied, The Epoch Times reserve the right to collect any applicable payment, return item, rejection, or insufficient funds fee. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.

**(b) Payment Method.** To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing The Epoch Times to store your payment method and process such payments. You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the website at: “My Account / Subscription / Payment Method”.

By providing The Epoch Times with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize The Epoch Times to charge you for the Services using your payment method; and (iii) authorize The Epoch Times to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis (automatic renewals) for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven’t previously been processed.

Additionally, you agree to permit The Epoch Times to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions.

**(c)** The Epoch Times reserves the right to change prices and fees at any time. We will notify you in advance if the rate that you will be charged for a product changes from what was stated at the time of your order. You will have the opportunity to cancel or change your subscription at that time. If you do not cancel or change your subscription, you will be charged the new subscription fee for your next billing period.

**(d)** Please ensure you have only one subscription account with us, otherwise  we will assume you wish to keep other subscriptions to remain active. In the event of a duplicate account, you have to notify us before the billing date. For refunds, please visit the Refunds Section.

12\. REFUND.
------------

No refunds will be issued on any of our products. All payments made on purchases and gifts are final and non-refundable. No full nor partial refunds will be issued for the days between the termination and the end of the current billing period. No exceptions.

However, if you believe The Epoch Times has charged you in error, you must contact us within thirty (30) days of such charge.

If you terminate a “lifetime digital subscription”, the Services will terminate immediately and will not be reinstated.

13\. TERMINATION.
-----------------

If you are subscribed to any of our Services, you may cancel at any time through your profile page online or by calling [Customer Service Hotline](#31_contact_us) to notify Epoch Times of your intent to terminate your subscription. Your termination will become effective at the end of your current billing period and no future payments will be charged.

----------

This Agreement and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York in the United States without reference to any conflict of law rules. You and Epoch Times agree to submit to the exclusive personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of the courts located within New York in the United States. You agree that you will not use the Services in any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable laws, restrictions, or regulations.

21\. ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
------------------------------------------------

### – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Arbitration Notice

You agree that if there is any dispute or claim arising from or related to our Services (except for the Exempt Claims, as defined below), these Terms of Service and/or the Data Protection and Privacy Policy it will be resolved by confidential binding arbitration in New York, rather than in court, after first giving Notice of the Dispute (“Notice”) to the other party and the opportunity to discuss resolution within thirty (30) days of such Notice. The Notice to the Company should be sent to The Epoch Times 229 W 28th, Floor 7th, New York 10001. This Notice must include a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting, and the relief sought.

If you and Epoch Times are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within thirty (30) days after the Notice is sent, you or Epoch Times may initiate arbitration proceedings to be conducted by a single impartial arbitrator chosen from the American Arbitration Association (AAA)’s National Roster of Commercial Arbitrators by mutual agreement of the Parties (or by the AAA if the Parties cannot agree). There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply, and the AAA will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.

The arbitration shall be held in the State of New York or at another mutually agreed location. If the arbitration involves a consumer, the arbitration will be held at a location convenient to the consumer. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 USD or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and us unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by applicable law. The arbitrator will also decide any questions relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this arbitration clause, except where a party files a claim in court because it is an Exempt Claim (as defined below). If either party files an Exempt Claim, the court presiding over that claim will determine if the claim is an Exempt Claim under this Arbitration Clause. The arbitrator’s award shall be confidential, final, and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Section (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Section, any such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of the Terms of Service containing this Section is posted to the websites and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a proceeding against us prior to the effective date of termination.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND EPOCH TIMES AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.

EXEMPT CLAIMS: You and Epoch Times agree that the following two (2) types of claims are not required to be submitted to an arbitration subject to the following conditions:

(a) You or we are not required to arbitrate a claim brought on an individual basis in small-claims court. However, if (a) there is an appeal from small-claims court, or (b) a change in the claim that renders the small-claims court unable to resolve the claim, then the claim must be resolved in an arbitration under the terms of this arbitration provision; and

(b) You or we are not required to arbitrate a claim brought on an individual basis to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Such a claim may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights could cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are an inadequate remedy. The prevailing party in an action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights is entitled to recover costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in pursuing that remedy.

OPT OUT: You may opt-out of this mandatory arbitration provision by writing us within sixty (60) calendar days of your agreement to this arbitration provision, either (a) by filling up the opt out form here \[link\], or (b) by mail to “Opt-Out Customer Service Department” to 5 Penn Plaza, 8th Floor, New York NY 10001. Include your name, address, and date in the correspondence. This is the only way you can opt-out.

24\. GENERAL INFORMATION.
-------------------------

If any provision(s) of this Agreement are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties with the other provisions remaining in full force and effect. Epoch Times’ failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Epoch Times in writing. To the extent permitted by law, and without limiting the effect of any disclaimer contained herein, User and Epoch Times agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to these Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. The section titles in this Agreement are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other services, third-party content or third-party software. If Epoch Times takes any action to enforce this Agreement, Epoch Times, if the prevailing party, will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees and any cost of litigation, in addition to any other relief, at law or in equity, to which Epoch Times may be entitled.

To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is deemed to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
