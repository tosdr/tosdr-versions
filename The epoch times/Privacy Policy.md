To the extent any California data privacy law applies to the collection of your personal information, this supplemental section of our Privacy Policy outlines the rights that California residents may have, and how they can exercise those rights.  This notice applies solely to California residents.

3. If the nature of the third party’s business cannot be determined from their name, to obtain examples of the products or services marketed.

California residents may have separate rights under the CPRA, including the following:

* **Right to Correct Inaccurate Information.** To the extent that we may maintain inaccurate personal Information, you have the right to request that we correct such inaccurate personal information taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal Information. Once we receive and verify your verifiable consumer request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct your personal information.

Once The Epoch Times receives and confirms a verifiable consumer request, we will work to promptly process such request. The need to verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information, and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf. To that end, we must be able to verify your information in order to process your request. You may fill out and submit a verifiable privacy rights request form [HERE](https://theepochtimes-privacy.my.onetrust.com/webform/b47a4d8a-645c-4d8d-8da1-73d781dd8fd7/7bed86f8-e732-44ec-b735-c6d4e6e1e77e).

We will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include your name, address, account information, and any other information deemed necessary by The Epoch Times to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information about you within our systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is necessary to fulfill the Services you requested or meet a legal obligation. We will inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request.

We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. You may use an authorized agent to submit verifiable consumer requests on your behalf provided that the authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity that you have authorized to act on your behalf.  If you use an authorized agent, we will require: (1) proof of written permission for the authorized agent to make requests on your behalf, and identity verification from you; or (2) proof of power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4665.

We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to confirm a request for your information is a “verifiable request.”

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.

#### **Financial Incentives**

As an incentive for providing us with your information, you may receive a financial benefit in the form of an email coupon, discount, rebate, free sample, promotions, or other similar reward that will be sent to you.  This discount may constitute a financial incentive under the CPRA (“Financial Incentive”).  The categories of personal information required for us to provide the Financial Incentives include personal identifiers such as full name and contact information including email address as well as personal and demographic information you choose to provide.

To offer these discounts, we may track your personal information, such as purchase history and other demographic data.  You have the right to withdraw from the Financial Incentive at any time by submitting a request [HERE](https://help.theepochtimes.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
