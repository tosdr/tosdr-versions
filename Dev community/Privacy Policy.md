Privacy Policy
==============

_**Last Updated: September 01, 2023**_

This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how DEV Community Inc. ("**DEV**," "**we**," or "**us**") collects, use, and discloses your personal information.

**What's With the Defined Terms?**

You'll notice that some words appear in quotes in this Privacy Policy.  They're called "defined terms," and we use them so that we don't have to repeat the same language again and again.  They mean the same thing in every instance, to help us make sure that this Privacy Policy is consistent. We've included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them in context.

[](#1-what-does-this-privacy-policy-apply-to)**1.** **WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on our websites, mobile applications, and other online or offline offerings — basically anything we do. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, mobile applications, and other offerings are all collectively called the "**Services.**" Beyond this Privacy Policy, your use of the Services is subject to our [DEV Community Terms](https://dev.to/terms) and our Forem Terms.

The Services include both our own community forum at [https://www.dev.to](https://www.dev.to/) (the "**DEV Community**") and the open source tool we provide called "**Forem**," available at [https://www.forem.com](https://www.forem.com/) which allows our customers to create and operate their own online forums.

We collect personal information from two categories of people: (1) our customers, who use Forem and our hosting services to run and host their own forums (we'll call them "**Forem Operators**"), and (2) the people who interact with DEV-hosted forums, including forums provided by Forem Operators utilizing Forem and separately our own DEV Community (we'll call them "**Users**").

**An Important Note for Users** Since we provide hosting services for Forem Operators, technically we also process your information on their behalf. That processing is governed by the contracts that we have in place with each Forem Operator, not this Privacy Policy. In other words, when you share your data on a DEV-hosted forum operated by a Forem Operator, we at DEV are basically just the "pipes" — we process the data on behalf of the Forem Operator, but don't do anything with it ourselves beyond what we're required to do under our contract (and by law). So, if you post your information on a DEV-powered forum provided by a Forem Operator, that Forem Operator's privacy policy applies, and any questions or requests relating to your data on that service should be directed to that Forem Operator, not us. Likewise, if you use our mobile application, you may also interact with forums that use DEV's open-source tools but do all their hosting and data collection themselves. For those forums, we at DEV have no access to your data, so be sure to read the privacy policy of any third-party hosted forum before posting.

[](#2-personal-information-we-collect)2\. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you're a User or Forem Operator, how you interact with us, our Services, and the requirements of applicable law. Breaking it down, we collect three types of information: (1) information that you provide to us directly, (2) information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and (3) information we get about you from other sources (such as third-party services and organizations). More details are below.

### [](#a-information-you-provide-to-us-directly)**A.** **Information You Provide to Us Directly**

We may collect the following personal information that you provide to us.

* **Account Creation (for Forem Operators):** We'll require your name and email address to get started, as well as some details about the Forem you want to run, such as: whether you're running the Forem on your own behalf or as part of an organization, and details about the community you want to support (how big is it, what topics does it cover, where do members currently communicate, how/if the community earns money, whether the community is open, invite-only or paid, any existing social media accounts, etc.) You'll need to tell us a bit about your personal coding background, and you'll have the option to provide your DEV username as well, if you are a member of the DEV.to community.
    
* **Account Creation (for Users)**: We collect name and email address from users that create an account on DEV Community. For other forums created by Forem Operators using Forem, the Forem Operator determines what information is required for User account creation for their respective forums.
    
* **Interactive Features (for Users)**. Like any other social network, both we and other Users of our Services may collect personal information that you submit or make available through our interactive features (e.g., messaging and chat features, commenting functionalities, forums, blogs, posts, and other social media pages). While we do have private messages that are only between you and the person you're messaging (as well as us and the Forem Operator, as applicable), any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services, such as the information you post to your public profile or the topics you follow is public, including to recruiters and prospective employers, and is not subject to any of the privacy protections we mention in this Privacy Policy except where legally required. **Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to others.**
    
* **Purchases**. If you buy stuff on our shop site [https://shop.dev.to/](https://shop.dev.to/) (as either a User or Forem Operator), or otherwise if you pay us in connection with your use of the Forem service, we may collect personal information and details associated with your purchases, including payment information. Any payments made via our Services are processed by third-party payment processors, such as Stripe, Shopify, and PayPal. We do not directly collect or store any payment card information entered through our Services, but may receive information associated with your payment card information (e.g., your billing details).
    
* **Your Communications with Us (Users and Forem Operators)**. We may collect personal information, such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter or loyalty program, request customer or technical support, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.
    
* **Surveys**. We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include personal information (for example, your home address).
    
* **Sweepstakes or Contests**. We may collect personal information you provide for any sweepstakes or contests that we offer. In some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information of sweepstakes and contest winners.
    
* **Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events**. We may collect personal information from individuals when we attend conferences, trade shows, and other events.
    
* **Business Development and Strategic Partnerships**. We may collect personal information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities.
    
* **Job Applications**. We may post job openings and opportunities on our Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.
    

### [](#b-information-collected-automatically)**B.** **Information Collected Automatically**

We may collect personal information automatically when you use our Services:

* **Automatic Data Collection**. We may collect certain information automatically when you use our Services, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, browser or device information, location information (including approximate location derived from IP address), and Internet service provider. We may also automatically collect information regarding your use of our Services, such as pages that you visit before, during and after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use our Services. In addition, we may collect information that other people provide about you when they use our Services, including information about you when they tag you in their posts.
    
* **Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Other Technologies**. We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies ("**Technologies**") to automatically collect information through your use of our Services.
    
* **Cookies**. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.
    
* **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons**. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
    

Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:

* **Operationally Necessary**. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent  
    activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality.
    
* **Performance-Related**. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services (_see Analytics below_).
    
* **Functionality-Related**. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed.
    
* **Analytics**. We may use Technologies and other third-party tools to process analytics information on our Services. Some of our analytics partners include Google Analytics. For more information,please visit [Google Analytics' Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). To learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analytics' use of your information, please click [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    
* **Social Media Platforms**. Our Services may contain social media buttons such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Instagram, and Twitch (that might include widgets such as the "share this" button or other interactive mini programs). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these platforms are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
    

_See the "Your Privacy Choices and Rights" section below to understand  
your choices regarding these Technologies._

### [](#c-information-collected-from-other-sources)**C.** **Information Collected from Other Sources**

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our Services through a third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login service (e.g., through Twitter, Apple, or GitHub), or a social networking site, we may collect whatever information about you from that third-party application that you have made available via your privacy settings.

(The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party's data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a User or Forem Operator and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.

[](#11-other-provisions)**11.** **OTHER PROVISIONS**
----------------------------------------------------

**Third-Party Websites or Applications**. The Services may contain links to other websites or applications, and other websites or applications may reference or link to our Services.
