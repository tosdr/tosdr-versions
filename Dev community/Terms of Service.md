### 11\. Content Policy

* If a post contains affiliate links, that fact must be clearly disclosed. For instance, with language such as: “This post includes affiliate links; I may receive compensation if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.”

DEV Community reserves the right to remove any content that it deems to be in violation of this policy at its sole discretion. Additionally, DEV Community reserves the right to restrict any user’s ability to participate on the platform at its sole discretion.
