If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may sign in to the Site and cancel your subscription.

Anti-Fraud Policy
-----------------

BulletVPN hereby states that no accounts would be offered to clients residing in African nations except South Africa. This step had to be taken in wake of increasing complaints of fraudulent activities originating from Nigeria. However, BulletVPN reserves its right to allow anyone as an exception to get an account, on receipt of government Issued IDs or Landline phone. Anyone who tries to bypass checks will immediately get his/her account terminated. All fraudulent activities may be reported to the respective police and related law enforcement authorities.

In order to serve our legitimate customers, like yourself, with a VPN network that is free from troubles/downtime, we have employed a stringent Anti-Fraud Policy. If our anti-fraud system rates your transaction as a ‘potential risk’, you will be requested to go through a verification process. The mere purpose of asking for such verification is the fact that we need to keep fraudsters away and because we believe you are a genuine customer, you will have no issues in choosing from one of the options offered to you e.g. Send us a blank email from a non-free email address, Send us any NON-CONFIDENTIAL Document, etc.
