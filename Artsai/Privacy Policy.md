Effective November 26, 2024

About ArtsAI services
---------------------

Adxcel Inc. dba ArtsAI ("ArtsAI" or "we" "us" "our") provides targeted advertising and marketing services for our business customers, including advertisers, advertising agencies and publishers.

Through our services, business customers can create, manage and measure served advertisements, measure website and other digital property visits, and monitor the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

To provide our services, we collect and use information about consumers who are targeted with ads. By “information” we mean information relating to an identified or identifiable consumer or that is considered "personal information" or "personal data" under applicable law.

This Privacy Policy describes:

* The types of information ArtsAI collects from consumers.
* How that information is collected and used.
* To whom that information is disclosed.
* Consumer choices regarding the collection and use of such information.
* How that information is secured.

See additional relevant disclosures if you are a consumer who lives in the following regions:

* [California](#california)
* [Colorado, Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, or Virginia](#colorado)
* [Nevada](#nevada)
* [EEA, Switzerland, or the UK](#eu)

For our contact details, see the [Contact Us](#contact_us) section below.

What Information We Collect
---------------------------

We collect the following categories of information about consumers:

* **Device identifiers**, such as Ad IDs and IP addresses.  
    Ad IDs are user-resettable identifiers (such as the Apple IDFA or Android Advertising ID) found in mobile device operating systems. IP addresses are numbers that identify a device connected to an internet network. IP addresses may be truncated or encrypted or both based on local legislation or other requirements.  
    Device identifiers also include pseudonymous advertiser identifiers, which are unique identifiers generated by us or a third party that are linked to a device but not intended to identify a consumer.
* **Device information**, such as operating software and browser details (e.g., type, version, and configuration), internet service provider details, and regional and language settings.
* **Internet activity**, such as device browsing history and interactions, date and times of visits, domains and pages visited, referring and exiting pages, and ad data. Ad data is data about the online ads that have been served or attempted to be served to a device. For example, how many times an ad has been served and whether the ad was clicked on or otherwise interacted with.
* **Non-precise location data**, such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level.
* **Characteristics or demographics**, such as country.
* **Inferences** generated from any of the above. For example, consumer interests.

How We Collect Information
--------------------------

We collect information in the following contexts:

* **When you interact with a website, mobile app, advertising, podcast, or other online service that contains the ArtsAI pixel**  
    ArtsAI operates a proprietary ArtsAI pixel. A pixel is a small transparent image that is placed on websites, mobile apps, advertisements, podcasts, and other online services that allows communication between a web browser and a server. We collect information through ArtsAI pixels embedded within ArtsAI’s own services as well as within the websites, mobile apps, advertisements, podcasts, and other online services of ArtsAI’s business customers and third parties who have contracted with ArtsAI to use the pixel.
* **When you interact with our website**  
    We collect information when you browse or otherwise interact with the ArtsAI website, including information you provide directly (such as in a webform) and information automatically collected through third party pixels and cookies embedded within the website. Cookies are small text files stored in a web browser that can remember preferences, recognize browsers, and communicate with pixels. Cookies can be controlled by browser settings.
* **Information from our business customers**  
    In addition to information collected through the ArtsAI pixel, we obtain information provided by our business customers in connection with helping them create, manage and measure served advertisements, measure website and other digital property visits, and monitor the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. For example, we may collect information through third party pixels and cookies embedded within their services, such as Google’s ad server (DFP).
* **Information from our affiliates**  
    We obtain information from our affiliates. For example, in connection with providing services to our business customers, we are able to access the Claritas Identity Graph and obtain information about you. For details about Claritas’ privacy practices, see the [Claritas Privacy Policy.](https://claritas.com/privacy-legal/)
* **Information from third party data sources**  
    We also collect information from third party data sources. For example, information obtained via server-to-server connection, or via secure file transfer.

How We Use the Information We Collect
-------------------------------------

We collect and use information for the following purposes:

* **Targeting**  
    Selecting ads that are more likely to be relevant to you based on the interests previously associated with your device and the time of day you may be most interested in viewing these specific ads.
* **Frequency capping**  
    Making sure you don't see the same ad too many times.
* **Sequencing**  
    If you are being served a sequence of ads, making sure we show you the right ad next in the sequence.
* **Cross-device matching**  
    Identifying different devices that are likely to be associated with you so that ads can be targeted, capped and sequenced across those devices, and so that campaign effectiveness can be measured and analyzed.
* **Attribution**  
    Monitoring when, where, and at what price we served certain ads on behalf of an advertiser so that we can measure our influence on the marketing results of the advertiser’s campaigns and overall marketing strategy.
* **Reporting**  
    Providing advertisers insights into how their ads are performing and gain insights into their customers. Reporting may include ad metrics such as impressions, clicks, and conversions. This data allows an advertiser to determine if an ad is not performing well (customers are not clicking on it), so that the advertiser will be able to see that data and update the ad.
* **Improvements**  
    Developing and improving our services, including training our models and algorithms.

In some cases, ArtsAI acts as a processor or service provider on behalf of a business customer. When acting in such capacity, ArtsAI will process the information in strict accordance with the permissions and restrictions imposed by the business customer providing such information. Please see our business customer’s privacy policy for details.

To Whom We Disclose Information
-------------------------------

We disclose information about you:

* **To our business customers**  
    We disclose information to our business customers in connection with providing services to them. For example, we may disclose information about how you have interacted with an advertiser’s ads.
* **To our service providers**  
    We contract with and disclose information to companies who help with parts of our business operations (e.g., for example, website and data hosting, fraud prevention, viewability reporting), as well as billing, collections, tech, customer and operational support.
* **To third party vendors**  
    Some of the companies we work with independently control the purposes and means of processing your information. For these third parties, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their policies and terms of use.
* **To our affiliates**  
    We may disclose your information to our affiliates, including in connection with accessing the Claritas Identity Graph.
* **In connection with legal proceedings**  
    When we are under a legal obligation to do so, for example to comply with a binding order of a court, or where disclosure is necessary to exercise, establish or defend the legal rights of ArtsAI, our business customers or any other third party.
* **In connection with security, enforcement, and the law**  
    We disclose information to comply with the law or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We also disclose information to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, our services or anyone else.
* **In connection with a sale of our business**  
    If ArtsAI considers selling, merging or otherwise reorganizing its business, we reserve the right to transfer and disclose information to any potential or actual purchaser or investor.

Data Retention
--------------

We retain information for the length of time that is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. Below are some specific policies:

    Information associated with Google’s ad server (DFP), including Ad Ids and IP addresses, are deleted from our active database after 15 months following our provision of services to a business customer.

International Data Transfers
----------------------------

Information collected from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and other countries outside of the United States may be transferred to and processed in the United States. For all collection and processing of personal data from outside of the United States, ArtsAI will act as a processor on behalf of its advertiser and publisher clients and will not serve as a data controller. We will protect all transferred information and ensure that international transfers comply with applicable data transfer laws.

Information Relating to Children
--------------------------------

Our products and services are not designed or intended for children (as defined in applicable data protection laws). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children on the websites we operate or through our services. Please advise us if you are aware of our having received personal information from a child, in which case we will take appropriate steps to delete it. For these purposes, "children" and "child" refer to ages defined by applicable law in the countries where we provide our services.

Data Security and Protection
----------------------------

We apply technical, administrative and organizational security measures designed to protect the information we collect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against other unlawful forms of processing.

Linking to Other Sites
----------------------

Ads with the embedded ArtsAI pixel usually link to other websites, which may have privacy assurance practices that differ from ours. ArtsAI does not control and cannot be held responsible for the content of these websites and data collection on these web sites by any third party. To make sure your privacy is protected, please consult the respective privacy policy of the web site you are visiting.

Your Choices
------------

We recognize how important your online privacy is to you, so we offer the following options for controlling the targeted ads (sometimes called "interest-based ads") you receive and how we use your information.

Claritas Identity Graph

As noted above, we access the Claritas Identity Graph in connection with providing services to our business customers. If you wish to have your information deleted from the Claritas Identity Graph, please make your request [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/68582716-6ce4-4f6e-bf08-78371b5f3292/6c7dc52d-0e2b-481f-9256-0755179e3783).

ArtsAI Pixel Browser Opt Out

We offer a browser-based opt out for our ArtsAI pixel that reduces the number of targeted ads you receive. This opt out does not impact how we use or disclose information collected through the ArtsAI pixel.

To opt out of targeted ads shown in connection with the ArtsAI-pixel, [сlick here](#).

By clicking above, we will drop an opt-out cookie on your browser, which allows us to recognize that browser in the future and respect your opt-out preferences for that browser. The cookie will apply to the specific browser you are using. If you wish to opt out for other browsers that you use, you must repeat the process using those browsers. All other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt out will be effective with respect to the browser used as long as you do not delete the cookie file from your hard drive. Please note that if you erase all cookies from your computer, you will also erase our opt-out cookie and will need to repeat the process of opting out. This opt out will not work for non-browser based services, such as mobile apps.

DAA Opt Out

ArtsAI is a participant in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and we adhere to the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles. The DAA offers an opt-out tool that, similar to the ArtsAI pixel Browser Opt Out, allows consumers to reduce the number of targeted ads they receive from DAA participants. This opt-out tool does not impact how participants use or disclose information collected through the ArtsAI pixel.

For details on how to opt out, see [https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control). We are not responsible for the effectiveness of their tools.

Resetting your Ad ID

Most mobile devices allow you to reset your device’s Ad ID through your device settings, which is designed to limit how the prior Ad ID can be used. See your device settings for details.

Region-Specific Choice

See additional relevant disclosures regarding your rights if you are a consumer who lives in the regions below.

ArtsAI has further committed to refer unresolved DPF-related complaints to a U.S.-based independent dispute resolution mechanism, BBB NATIONAL PROGRAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [https://www.bbbprograms.org/dpf-complaints](https://www.bbbprograms.org/dpf-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.

If your DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf).
