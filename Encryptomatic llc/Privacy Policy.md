==============

Encryptomatic LLC Privacy Policy

This gives you a chance to accept or reject the cookie. Nearly every website on the internet stores cookies when you visit it.

Communicate with you;

When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns). We may also utilize advertising retargeting services commonly offered by Google, Bing and other ad platforms.

### SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

For example, we use Ultracart to power our online store including the shopping card hosted at secure.encryptomatic.com – you can read more about how Ultracart uses your Personal Information here: www.ultracart.com/legal/privacypolicy.html. We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site–you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: //www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

### BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING

As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications from Encryptomatic LLC (such as new product announcements, update announcements or special product pricing) that we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) educational page at //www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.

You can opt out of targeted advertising by:

FACEBOOK – //www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads  
GOOGLE – //www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous  
BING – //advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads

Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out portal at: //optout.aboutads.info/.

As a small business, we utilize the common advertising platforms that are available to us and other U.S.A.-based small businesses to market our products, but we are not the provider of the platform. Your efforts to control your privacy are well served by making your preferences known directly to the major platform provides, including Facebook, Google, Bing, among others. Controlling your information on these platforms will necessarily impact the data that these platforms provide to us or collect from us, and will affect the methods we can use to reach you with our advertising messages.

### DO NOT TRACK

Although we would like to respect Do Not Track (DNT) requests, we find that we are hamstrung by the larger advertising platforms we need to use to conduct our business, and therefor we have little control over web browser Do Not Track requests. Companies like Google, for example, do not natively respect DNT and limit our ability to force then to respect DNT. In the past we've tried writing JS code to only fire Google Analytics requests if DNT is not detected, but this simply has not been effective or stable. Since using Google's platform is a necessary way for us to reach customers with news about our products, it places us in a difficult "all or nothing situation, where we either respect DNT by removing the entire Google platform, or we stay in business by using those platforms without any resonable control over DNT. You may be able to use [Google's analytic's opt-out browser add-in](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to impact DNT requests. It's a worth a look, anyway. For the time being, until we ourselves are able to effectively respect DNT requests, or until major platform provides like Google provide us this capability, please assume that we unable to, and therefor do not, alter our Site's data collection and use practices when your browser sends a Do Not Track signal.

### YOUR RIGHTS

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.

Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe to our servers in the United States.

### DATA RETENTION

When you place an order through the Site, Encryptomatic LLC will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information. We retain customer contact information indefinitely or at our discretion, so we can provide customer support services, product updates and security notices. We may retain this information on our own servers, or on the servers of 3rd parties that provide CRM or other business services to us, such as Ultracart or Hubspot.For example, if you bought a product from us 10 years ago and now you need our assistance to recover a lost product key, our customer support team will use this information to assist you.
