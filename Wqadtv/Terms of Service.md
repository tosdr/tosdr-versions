You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Site's registration form.

We respect the privacy of the users of our Site. Please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.wqad.com/privacy).

Responsibility for Your Account
-------------------------------

To use certain features of our Site, you will need to create an account. We reserve the right to terminate the use of any account, or to deny access to the Site or any features of the Site, to anyone who violates these Terms of Service or who, in our sole judgment, interferes with the ability of others to enjoy our website or infringes the rights of others. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, and are responsible for all activities (whether by you or by others) that occur under your account.

Online Commerce
---------------

Certain sections of the Site may include links to third-party websites where you can purchase products and services online from those websites. When you click on one of these links and are redirected to the third-party website, your dealings from that point forward are with the operator of that website and not with us. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or any other aspect of the third-party website or any products and services you purchase from such website.

The Site also may include e-commerce functionality that is operated by our third-party vendor that allows you to purchase products and services directly from the Site. If you purchase any of these products or services via the Site, the information that you provide as part of the transaction, such as your credit card number and contact information, will be collected by the third-party operating that portion of the Site. Our vendor may have privacy and data collection practices that are different from ours, and your purchase of products or services on or through the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions that specifically apply to your purchase or use of such products or services, as indicated on the page of the Site where you make such purchase. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding a vendor, its online store, its privacy policies, and/or any additional terms and conditions that may apply, visit that vendor's website and click on its information links or contact the vendor directly. You release us from any damages that you incur, and agree not to assert any claims against us, arising from your purchase or use of any products or services made available through third parties via the Site.

You agree to be financially responsible for all purchases made by you or someone acting on your behalf through the Site. You agree to use the Site, and to purchase services or products through the Site, for legitimate, non-commercial purposes only. You also agree not to make any purchases for speculative, false or fraudulent purposes or for the purpose of anticipating demand for a particular product or service. You agree to only purchase goods or services for yourself or for another person for whom you are legally permitted to do so. When making a purchase for a third party that requires you to submit the third party's personal information to a vendor, you represent that you have obtained the express consent of such third party to provide such third party's personal information.

Modifications to, or Discontinuation of, the Site
-------------------------------------------------

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site, or any portion thereof, with or without notice at any time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Site or any portion thereof.

Disclaimers
-----------

Throughout our Site, we have provided links and pointers to Internet sites maintained by third parties. Our linking to such third-party sites does not necessarily imply an endorsement or sponsorship of such sites, or the information, products or services offered on or through the sites.

Other
-----

This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals and communications, written or oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the products or services of a third party that are provided through the Site. In the event of any conflict between any such third-party terms and conditions and these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will govern.

This Agreement is entered into in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of its choice of law rules. Each party to this Agreement hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the County of New York in the State of New York, and waives any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. In any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

These Terms of Service are not intended to benefit any third party, and do not create any third-party beneficiaries. Accordingly, these Terms of Service may only be invoked or enforced by you or us. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Service must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
