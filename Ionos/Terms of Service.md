**3.2.1** Should you choose to register a domain name through IONOS, IONOS will register a second level domain name on your behalf, provided such domain name is available for registration. IONOS acts only as an intermediary between you and the organization providing the domain name, and has no influence over the assignment of domain names. The registration of your domain name is subject to the terms and conditions of those [registry terms and conditions](https://www.ionos.com/terms-gtc/domain/), and is also subject to the terms of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (["UDRP"](https://www.icann.org/)). You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions of the UDRP in effect at the time of the dispute. IONOS assumes no liability in the event the domain name is unavailable or otherwise not assigned to you, and does not warrant or guarantee that assigned domain names do not infringe the rights of third parties, or that you will retain the rights to that domain name for any period of time. Upon payment in full of any and all registration fees, IONOS shall not own or otherwise legally control any domain name registered on your behalf. You agree that you are responsible for any and all fees and costs related to the registration of your domain name, and you authorize IONOS to debit the Payment Account for any such fees and costs. You acknowledge and agree that in the event of termination or expiration of a domain name, IONOS shall be the Designated Agent, commencing from the effective date of termination/expiration. Unless terminated, at the end of each term your domain name shall automatically renew for an additional term and you further authorize IONOS to debit your Payment Account for the renewal fee associated with such renewal term and any related fees or charges. Should the Payment Account provider fail to honor such renewal fee, IONOS may, in its sole discretion, release, cancel, or otherwise dispose of or utilize your domain name as it sees fit, with no obligation to you whatsoever. If a domain is terminated, IONOS may delete the domain registration forty (40) days after effective date of such domain name termination. Additionally, IONOS may, in its sole discretion, assign the domain name to another party for any and all purposes.

**3.2.2.** You acknowledge and agree that IONOS or its agents, assignees or licensees may associate any data of any kind, in IONOS’s sole discretion, with the Domain Name registered in association with Your Web Site or any URL incorporating said Domain Name until you replace such data with Your Web Site, at such times as Your Web Site is no longer available, and upon termination for any reason, for as long as IONOS or IONOS’s agent, assignee or licensee continue to be listed as the hosting entity with the domain name registry used to register such Domain Name. This paragraph shall apply to any and all web pages generated by IONOS or its affiliates, including but not limited to 404 error pages.

**3.2.3.** The Customer agrees and accepts that, for reasons of security and/or in accordance with ICANN and other registry policies, IONOS shall set domain locks under certain circumstances, including but not limited to domain name registrations, domain name transfers, and any Material Changes to domain name owner details.  The Customer will nevertheless be able to remove the transfer lock in order to allow a transfer of a domain name which has been applied for by third parties.

**3.2.4.** You represent and warrant that your domain name does not infringe the copyright, trademark, or any other intellectual property rights of any person or company and that your domain name is otherwise in compliance with the terms of this agreement, in particular the provisions of Section 8.

**3.2.5.** You shall inform IONOS of any claim or potential claim against your domain name, including but not limited to the initiation of a dispute under the UDRP, within five days of notification of same. Should you lose your right to use a domain name which is used in connection with the IONOS Inc. Services, whether through expiration of the domain name, judicial decree, administrative decisions of the UDRP or otherwise, you agree to inform IONOS immediately of the party to whom the domain name is to be transferred and you authorize IONOS to take any and all action necessary to effect such transfer.

**3.2.6.** IONOS will accept the transfer of domain names from other registrars, provided however, that you will be required to pay for an initial year of registration fees upon transfer. Domain names which have been prepaid for a period of more than one year but with fewer than nine years remaining may also be transferred, subject to the payment of an initial year of registration fees. An additional year will be added on to the remaining term of any transferred domain. Domain names with more than nine years remaining on the registration period may not be transferred. Upon the expiration of the one-year extension you will be charged an annual renewal fee for any subsequent renewal period. By requesting the transfer of your domain name you authorize IONOS to debit your Payment Account for the one-year registration fee and any related fees or charges.

**3.2.7.** You acknowledge and agree that in the event a Material Change in respect of a domain name owner is required for any reason, any responsibility and liability for such Material Changes shall be borne solely by the Customer and account owner as the Designated Agent.  The full ICANN Transfer Policy is available here.

**3.2.8.** You acknowledge and agree that IONOS reserves the right to act as Designated Agent (as such term is defined in the IONOS GT&C) with respect to any Material Change (as such term is defined in the IONOS GT&C) or update to the domain name owner for any reason, without any liability to the domain name owner.  The full ICANN Transfer Policy is available on the ICANN website. 

**3.2.9.** The Private Domain Registration Services offered by IONOS are subject to the terms and conditions of IONOS’s Private Registration Service (the "T&C Private Domain Registration"), which are incorporated herein by reference.

**3.2.10.** In using our Privacy Service, you agree to opt out of the 60-day transfer lock normally applied following any Material Change (as such term is defined in the IONOS GT&C).

**3.2.11.** You acknowledge and agree that IONOS may suspend, cancel, transfer or modify your domain name registration at any time, for any reason, at the IONOS’s sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, IONOS may, in its sole discretion, suspend, cancel, transfer or modify a domain name registration:

1\. to correct mistakes made by IONOS, another registrar, or the applicable registry administrator,

2\. to resolve a dispute related to that domain name,

3\. within five (5) calendar days of the creation date of that domain name registration,

4\. if you breach this Agreement (including any applicable additional rule or policy),

5\. if you use a domain name in connection with unlawful activity.

6\. if IONOS believes, in its sole discretion, that the domain name has been registered fraudulently

7\. upon receipt of a court order or other notification from a court of competent jurisdiction, an arbitration award, or other legal authority requiring the suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification of your domain name registration.  
  
You further acknowledge and agree that your domain name registration is subject to suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification pursuant to the terms of any rules or policies applicable to your domain name registration, including, but not limited to (i) the UDRP, (ii) any ICANN adopted policy, (iii) any registrar (including IONOS) or registry administrator procedures, or (iv) any other ccTLD registry administrator procedures. As more completely set forth in Sections 6, 7, and 10, you waive any and all claims you may have, now and forever, against IONOS relating to the suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification of your domain name registration.

**3.2.12.** You shall have the right to cancel your contract in the event that the initial domain name registration price is greater than the price originally listed by IONOS. For the purposes of clarity, this termination right is only in relation to the new gTLDs and only under the above circumstances.

**3.2.13.** You agree, and acknowledge, that some TLDs will have non-uniform renewal registration pricing such that the Fee for a domain name registration renewal may differ from other domain names in the same or other TLDs.  
You can review IONOS’s current renewal fees on the IONOS website.

**10.2** The customer himself is responsible for compliance with all legal regulations applicable to the operation of his e-shop and other IONOS products and that Customer agrees to hold harmless IONOS Inc. Inc. and its affiliates, employees, agents, representatives, contractors and others in compliance with IONOS Inc. Inc.’s GT&Cs. for the use of this product/service.

**10.3** IONOS may provide the user with access to software, services or applications (“apps”) developed and published by third parties via the “App Market” functionality within IONOS products such as the online shop. Allowing the customer to access third party apps is merely a convenience to the customer and in no way constitutes an endorsement, sponsorship or any form of association of IONOS with those third parties. Third party developers or publishers are independent parties from IONOS, and IONOS has no responsibility to intervene in any way in the relationship between the third party and the customer. IONOS advises the customer that by using third party apps, the customer is in agreement with the terms and conditions set forth by the third party itself, and that the present agreement does not regulate the relationship between the customer and the third party.  IONOS advises the customer that, by using any third party apps, private and/or sensitive information the customer shares with IONOS may be accessible by the third party providing the app, and that IONOS is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of data which may result from this access. The customer agrees that IONOS, its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates are in no way responsible for any damage incurred by the use of any third party apps, and thus will not be held liable for any claim or demand that may arise from the use of third party apps in the “App Market” functionality

Any action under this section 21.3 may be brought in either the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania or the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia County Pennsylvania, and each party consents to the in personam jurisdiction of such Courts for the purpose of any such action or proceeding. Each party hereby waives all rights it has or which may hereafter arise to contest such exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania or the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia County Pennsylvania.

**21.4.**   In addition to the foregoing, YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT AS A PART OF THE CONSIDERATION FOR THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY DISPUTE ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND IONOS THAT IS IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, and that such waiver shall be enforceable up to and including the day that trial is to start, and even if the arbitration provisions of this paragraph are waived.

**21.5.**   Neither you nor IONOS may be a representative of other potential claimants or a class of potential claimants in any dispute concerning or relating to this Agreement, nor may two or more individuals' disputes be consolidated or otherwise determined in one proceeding.

**23.2.**   You may not modify this Agreement, in whole or in part, and any such modification or attempt to modify shall not be enforceable unless reduced to writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of IONOS. No additional or conflicting term in any other document used by you will have any legal effect.
