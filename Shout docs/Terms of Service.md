If you decide to upgrade your subscription at any time, from a cheaper subscription to a more expensive one, midway through a current subscription term, we will apply a pro-rated refund on your account for the remaining term of your lower subscription and apply the new subscription rate to the remainder of your current term. Once your subscription renews, the full upgrade price shall apply.

If you exceed the limits of your current subscription plan then we may automatically increase your plan or apply additional charges the account at the next renewal.
