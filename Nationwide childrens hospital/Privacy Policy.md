### **7\. Text Message Program**

We may offer you enrollment in an SMS text message program to assist you with navigating your care. This may include features such as updates related to your visits, MyChart account updates, one-time passcode, billing notifications, prescription reminders, and care management.

TEXT MESSAGES MUST NEVER BE USED IN AN EMERGENCY, NOR SHOULD THEY BE USED TO COMMUNICATE URGENT HEALTH MATTERS. In an emergency, immediately dial 911 and/or go to the nearest emergency room. For non-emergency urgent matters, please call your physician, go to an emergency room, or dial 911, as necessary.

When you sign up for text messages from us, you:

1. Confirm that you want to be enrolled in texts from us and that you understand that text messages are not always encrypted throughout their transmission, so there is some risk that texts can be intercepted in transit and read by an unauthorized person. Additionally, text messages may be available to anyone who has access to your phone, such as if they see a notification pop-up on your phone’s home screen.
2. Agree that we may send you recurring automated texts at the number you provided. You do not need to consent to receive texts as a condition of receiving care. Message and data rates may apply. Text “STOP” at any time to stop receiving text messages; text “HELP” for help.
3. Represent that you are 18 years or older, are legally able to enter into agreements on your own behalf and agree to these Terms.  If you will be receiving or sending texts on behalf of another individual (such as a child, parent or partner) who is the patient, you are also representing that you have the legal right or authority, or have obtained all necessary consents and authorizations, to communicate on behalf of such other person.

If you opt-out of the text program you will receive a final message confirming that you were unsubscribed. You will no longer receive text messages from the short code you opted out from. If you want to join again, sign up using your MyChart account or text HELP to the short code for instructions.

If you experience issues with the text message program you can reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or you can get help directly at 614-355-3750 or via email at [nchservicedesk@nationwidechildrens.org](mailto:nchservicedesk@nationwidechildrens.org).

Text message frequency may vary based on the Services. Participating carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.  As always, message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to you from us and to us from you.

### **11\. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; and Class Action Waiver**

EXCLUDING DISPUTES ADDRESSED THROUGH ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COMPETENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, OHIO IN RELATION TO ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, OR DIFFERENCE ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, AND YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF REMOVAL OR TRANSFER WHETHER DUE TO FORUM NON-CONVENIENS OR OTHER REASON. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Transaction Act (UCITA) are expressly excluded from these Terms.

We are reachable via the contact information at the end of these Terms to address any concern you may have regarding your use of the Services. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to you initiating a lawsuit or arbitration against us. Any matter or dispute relating in any way to your use of the Services or these Terms, which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided below.

Excluding claims by us for injunctive or other non-monetary relief, any claims related to the Services and any dispute or controversy arising out of or related to these Terms (including the Website Privacy Policy), including without limitation, any and all disputes, claims (whether in tort, contract, statutory, or otherwise) or disagreements concerning the existence, breach, interpretation, application, or termination of these Terms, shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Inc. Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment on any award(s) rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking immediate injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate. The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all confidential information, all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by the other party in the proceedings and not otherwise in the public domain, except to the extent that disclosure may be legally required of a party, necessary to protect or pursue a legal right, or to reinforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority.

The arbitration shall take place in Columbus, Ohio or at the option of the party seeking relief, online, by telephone, via written submissions alone or in your state of residence if requested, and be administered by JAMS; provided however, that in the event that five (5) or more individuals seek to initiate (or do initiate) arbitration proceedings against us in a coordinated or related manner (e.g., coordination among plaintiffs or their counsel with regard to similar claims), then instead of such arbitrations being administered by JAMS, we may elect in our sole discretion to consolidate such arbitrations before an arbitrator mutually agreed-upon by the parties (and terminate any pending administration by JAMS), (i) with such arbitrator being a retired federal or state judge and experienced with the subject matter of the arbitration, and (ii) except with respect to administration of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator shall follow the JAMS Inc. Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or a similar set of procedures from the arbitration organization that the selected arbitrator is associated with.

YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRAIL IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. IN ADDITION, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCEPT FOR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED ABOVE, YOU AGREE THAT EACH PARTY TO A DISPUTE HEREUNDER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and we agree (of for consolidated arbitration as provided above), no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

### **12\. The Services Are Operating from the USA**

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may have negotiated and executed written agreements with specific individuals or organizations with respect to specific matters addressed therein, and nothing in these Terms is intended to supersede any such agreements.

PHI includes demographic information including a patient’s name, address, age, race, and sex.

**IV. Ways We Can Use or Share Your PHI for Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations**

We can use or share your PHI without your written permission (Authorization) for many activities that are common in hospitals. For instance, we do not need an Authorization from you for the following uses and disclosures:

* **For Treatment.** We use and share your PHI to provide care and other services to you--for example, to diagnose and treat your injury or illness. In addition, we may contact you to provide appointment reminders or information about treatment options. We may tell you about other health-related benefits and services that might interest you. We may also share PHI with other doctors, nurses, and others involved in your care.
* **To Obtain or Provide Payment.** We may use and share your PHI to receive payment for services that we provide to you. For example, we may share your PHI to request and receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid, your health insurer, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), or other company or program that arranges or pays the cost of some or all of your health care (“Your Payor”) and to confirm that Your Payor will pay for health care.
* **To Conduct Health Care Operations.** We may use and share your PHI for our health care operations, which include management, care coordination, planning, and activities   that improve the quality and lower the cost of the care that we deliver. For example, we may use PHI to review the quality and skill of our physicians, nurses, and other health care providers. We may use your PHI to conduct quality assessment and improvement activities, including outcomes evaluation and the development    of clinical guidelines. We may also use your PHI to participate in population-based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs. Also, we might use your PHI to provide you information on health-related programs or products such as alternative medical treatments and programs.

**V. Disclosures You May Authorize Us to Make**

* **Use or Disclosure for Directory of Patients.** We may include your name, location in the hospital, general health condition and religious  affiliation in a patient directory without receiving your written authorization unless you tell us you do not want your information in the directory. Information in the directory may be shared with anyone who asks for you by name or with members of the clergy; however, religious affiliation will only be shared with members of the clergy.
* **Disclosure to Relatives, Close Friends and Your Other Caregivers**. We may share your PHI with your family member/relative, a close personal friend, or another person who you identify if we (1) first provide you with the chance to object to the disclosure and you do not object; (2) infer that you do not object to the disclosure; or (3) obtain your agreement to share your PHI with these individuals. If you are not present at the time we share your PHI, or you are not able to agree or disagree to our sharing your PHI because you are not capable or there is an emergency circumstance, we may use our professional judgment to decide that sharing the PHI is in your best interest. We may also use or share your PHI to notify (or assist in notifying) these individuals about your location and general condition.

Upon request, you may “opt-out” of HIE participation, in full or in part. The opt-out form is available by calling 614-355-0777 to request a copy. If you do not opt out, we may provide your health information to an approved HIE in which we participate in accordance with applicable law.
