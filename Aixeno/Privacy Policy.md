Any controversy, claim, or allegation of breach of contract, that arises out of, or relates to any lawful contracts made by aixeno inc., that are less than $ 100,000 U.S.D., shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) shall be a currently licensed attorney in good standing with the Washington State Bar Association (www.wsba.org). The place of arbitration shall be Spokane, WA, USA. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington. In making determinations regarding the scope of exchange of electronic information, the arbitrator(s) and the parties agree to be guided by The Sedona Principles, Third Edition: Best Practices, Recommendations & Principles for Addressing Electronic Document Production. Time is of the essence for any arbitration under this agreement and arbitration hearings shall take place within 90 days of filing and awards rendered within 120 days.

The arbitrator(s) shall not award consequential damages in any arbitration initiated under this section. Any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.

Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness. In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator(s) may require for the making of an award. Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in the contract documents, the parties hereby agree: that the Underlying Award may be appealed pursuant to the AAA's Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules ("Appellate Rules"); that the Underlying Award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall, at a minimum, be a reasoned award; and that the Underlying Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Underlying Award, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. Following the appeal process the decision rendered by the appeal tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

#### 38\. Definitions Of Legal Terms, Words, And Phrases

**2-Step Verification, 2FA, 2.F.A. - Two-Factor Authentication** - electronic verification(s) of an end-user, consumer, or customer, at sign-in/log-in to an electronic resource, through a two-step process of evaluating an end-user's credentials by referring to and matching identical added secret codes and unique identifying information. The first step of sign-in is usually an end-user entering a username and password on a login webpage. The second step to continue a secure sign-in to get into a protected electronic resource is to require passage through a 2FA management system, which requires the end-user to use another separate digital device (other than the digital device used to sign-in to a resource) to generate and/or receive a random code of letters and numbers that is then entered by the end-user into the log-in page and evaluated for matching by the 2FA system protecting entry to the electronic resources. The purpose of using 2FA is to add another layer of security and identity verification of end-users attempting to sign-in to a computer system, before granting secure access to any protected electronic resources, so that if any usernames and passwords were to be stolen, fraudulent access would not be granted because the criminal would not have the added 2FA credentials to be verified as a lawful and verified end-user. An "electronic resource" may include: any computer system, computer networks, apps, software programs, protected webpages, messaging apps, financial services, banking webpages, or databases.

**Abandoned Property, Abandoned Property Law (USA State Law)** - money or intangible property held for a period of time with no owner contact: several U.S. States have differing laws applying to unclaimed property.

**Accept, Acceptance** - a party gives their acceptance of an offer to form a contract (by actions, conduct, words, written acceptance) when that party agrees to accept an offer made during the formation of a contract, terms of use, license agreement, and when they additionally agree to be bound by the promises, terms, conditions, consideration (payment) and performance of the contract, terms of use, and license agreement.

**Acceptable Use** - use of technology by consumers, customers, and end-users that follows positive and lawful social norms and social behaviors. Acceptable use behaviors are required by this company and imposed upon consumers, customers, and end-users as a condition before they gain access to and use of any of the company’s digital solutions, digital technologies, or digital services. Acceptable Use of technology respects technology as a shared resource where everyone has access to and lawful use of a technology at any time, place, and/or manner, so that collectively and individually, all users always obey all applicable laws. Acceptable use of any technology and/or any technology related service means that any user or users will not interfere directly or indirectly with any other consumers, customers, or end-users that are using the technology at any time. Acceptable use means that all of the company's digital solutions, digital technologies, products, and services will not suffer any hinderance, delay, deletion, disruption, destruction, or other any other type of harm, from any use of its technologies, solutions, and services, which may be caused by any consumer's, customer's, and end-user's unacceptable use or (unlawful use) at any time. Acceptable Use also means that the company's technologies, solutions, and services will not be used at any time by any consumer(s), customer(s), and end-user(s) to cause any harm at any time by acting against this company, against any entity, or against any person(s).

**Access Date** - the date(s) and time(s) that any consumer or customer accessed, entered, signed-in, or opened, any technology provided by the company, to use it for some computerized actions that benefitted the consumer or customer.

**Access Point, Point of Access** - the entry point or first point of starting a multi-step-process of any end-user consumer using their computerized digital devices and their internet connection to get into a digital solution or digital technology to perform computerized actions. The several steps often include (without limitation): signing into it, logging into it, having lawful permission granted to sign in and log into and use the digital solution or digital technology. Permission to enter and use any access point provided by the company may be conditional, based upon first paying a subscription fee, and creating a new user account through a web page or website in order to then be granted permission to sign into, enter, and use a web application or other digital solution and technology. Access may be revocable under the terms and conditions of a license. (See also, the definitions of: "access," and "scope of access," and "authorized access" and "unauthorized access" and "exceeding authorized access," and "unpaid access" and "fraudulent access").

The first step of sign-in is usually an end-user entering a username and password on a login webpage. The second and subsequent steps to continue a secure sign-in to get into a protected electronic resource is to require passage through a MFA management system, which requires the end-user to use another separate digital device (other than the digital device used to sign-in to a resource) to generate and/or receive a random codes of letters and numbers that is then entered by the end-user into the log-in page and evaluated for matching by the MFA system protecting entry to the electronic resources. The purpose of using MFA is to add another layer of security and identity verification of end-users attempting to sign-in to a computer system, before granting secure access to any protected electronic resources, so that if any usernames and passwords were to be stolen, fraudulent access would not be granted because the criminal would not have the added MFA credentials to be verified as a lawful and verified end-user.
