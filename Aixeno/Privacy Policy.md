#### 38\. Definitions Of Legal Terms, Words, And Phrases

**2-Step Verification, 2FA, 2.F.A. - Two-Factor Authentication** - electronic verification(s) of an end-user, consumer, or customer, at sign-in/log-in to an electronic resource, through a two-step process of evaluating an end-user's credentials by referring to and matching identical added secret codes and unique identifying information. The first step of sign-in is usually an end-user entering a username and password on a login webpage. The second step to continue a secure sign-in to get into a protected electronic resource is to require passage through a 2FA management system, which requires the end-user to use another separate digital device (other than the digital device used to sign-in to a resource) to generate and/or receive a random code of letters and numbers that is then entered by the end-user into the log-in page and evaluated for matching by the 2FA system protecting entry to the electronic resources. The purpose of using 2FA is to add another layer of security and identity verification of end-users attempting to sign-in to a computer system, before granting secure access to any protected electronic resources, so that if any usernames and passwords were to be stolen, fraudulent access would not be granted because the criminal would not have the added 2FA credentials to be verified as a lawful and verified end-user. An "electronic resource" may include: any computer system, computer networks, apps, software programs, protected webpages, messaging apps, financial services, banking webpages, or databases.

**LLM - L.L.M. - Large Language Model** - human interaction with a computer using natural human language for questions and answers from an enormous data source. An LLM is often made from a software program, database, and a vast dataset of text information, which is evaluated by machine learning algorithms to examine and analyze language data through several artificial neural network matrices to discover statistical patterns of word frequencies, which could be used to form statistically plausible answers to questions given to the computer as prompts. A Large Language Model often requires reinforcement training from humans, significant computer processing and network resources, and several million dollars in total research and development costs to produce a functional LLM. The artificial intelligence of a Large Language Model is its software program code acting on language model data by relying on machine learning results to simulate human intelligence during the "chat-based" exchange of information.

The first step of sign-in is usually an end-user entering a username and password on a login webpage. The second and subsequent steps to continue a secure sign-in to get into a protected electronic resource is to require passage through a MFA management system, which requires the end-user to use another separate digital device (other than the digital device used to sign-in to a resource) to generate and/or receive a random codes of letters and numbers that is then entered by the end-user into the log-in page and evaluated for matching by the MFA system protecting entry to the electronic resources. The purpose of using MFA is to add another layer of security and identity verification of end-users attempting to sign-in to a computer system, before granting secure access to any protected electronic resources, so that if any usernames and passwords were to be stolen, fraudulent access would not be granted because the criminal would not have the added MFA credentials to be verified as a lawful and verified end-user. An "electronic resource" may include: any computer system, computer networks, apps, software programs, protected webpages, messaging apps, financial services, banking webpages, or databases.
