Your options in regard to the Personal Information we collect about you are described below. You may designate an authorized agent to exercise these options on your behalf by providing your authorized agent with written permission to act on your behalf and by verifying your own identity with APFM. Alternatively, you may provide a power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your interactions with us, such as by confirming your email address and/or your state of residence. In some cases, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government issued ID.

Access: As a California resident, you may request access to your Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, or sell and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you, subject to specified exceptions. You may also request additional details about our information practices, including the categories of the Personal Information we collected, the sources of collection, categories of Personal Information we share for a business or commercial purpose, and the categories of third parties we share your information with. You may request access by calling APFM at 888-552-1632 or by visiting the page: [https://my.aplaceformom.com/personal-information-request.html](https://my.aplaceformom.com/personal-information-request.html).

Category of Personal Information: Identifiers, such as your first name, last name, phone number, email address, and mailing address

Categories of Third Parties: senior care network providers, partners, and other third parties

Category of Personal Information: Information about the Services you are seeking for yourself or a Resident

Category of Third Parties: Categories of Third Parties: Senior care network providers, partners, and other third parties

For information about opting out of these “sales,” please see the “Do Not Sell My Info” section below. We do not knowingly disclose or sell personal information of minors under 16 years old without affirmative authorization.

Do Not Sell My Info: As described above, we may provide Personal Information for the purpose of connecting you with senior care network providers to discuss services that you may be interested in for yourself or for a Resident and to our partners and other third parties. We give you the option to opt out of such sharing at any time by following the [“Do Not Sell My Personal Information”](https://my.aplaceformom.com/personal-information.html) link. The link is also available on our Sites and mobile apps.

California’s Shine the Light law also permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. APFM qualifies for this alternative option. To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please email [privacy@aplaceformom.com](mailto:privacy@aplaceformom.com).
