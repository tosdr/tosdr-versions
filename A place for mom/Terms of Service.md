OUR SERVICES
------------

A Place for Mom is a senior housing and care marketing and information service that provides resources and personalized assistance in finding senior housing and care. We help families find options based on a loved one’s stated needs and preferences and empower them to make informed decisions. This may include independent living, home care, residential care homes, assisted living, specialized memory care, and skilled nursing. Based on the family’s stated needs and preferences, we provide the family with information about contracted communities (“Participating Communities”) and we forward the family’s information to those Participating Communities. Families can review detailed information about local and national Participating Communities, and get personalized, knowledgeable assistance by telephone from an APFM Senior Living Advisor. The service is offered at no charge to families as the Participating Communities pay a fee to APFM.

PARTICIPATING SENIOR HOUSING AND/OR CARE COMMUNITIES
----------------------------------------------------

The Participating Communities are solely responsible for evaluating, accepting (or declining, as appropriate), and caring for all residents, including, without limitation, ensuring that their staff are appropriately qualified, current on education, and possess the necessary facilities, resources, and equipment to competently provide the services and care required by its residents. Each Participating Community is responsible for the conditions at its community and the training of and acts and omissions of its employees, contractors, vendors, and any other individual who works at or for a community.

Each Participating Community is responsible for the content of the information posted on its page or on the Sites. The information does not represent our views or any individual associated with us, and we do not control this content. We do not vouch for the accuracy or completeness of any of the information posted by and/or for the Participating Community on the Sites, and do not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reading the information posted by and/or for the Participating Community on the Sites. By using the Sites and/or Services, you assume all associated risks.

NO ENDORSEMENT; NO AFFILIATION; NOT A BROKER
--------------------------------------------

We exercise no independent judgment as to the quality of, nor do we recommend or endorse, any Participating Community. We provide only an information service and do not (1) place the consumer in any Participating Community, (2) perform any medical assessment of or for the consumer or the Participating Community, or (3) participate in the consumer’s and Participating Community’s decision regarding final selection or admittance. Further, we are not a representative of or agent for either the consumer or the Participating Community and do not act on either’s behalf. It is the responsibility solely of the Participating Community and the potential resident, and/or the potential resident’s family and care provider(s) and/or other involved parties acting on the potential resident’s behalf to determine if any person is an appropriate admission to the Participating Community. APFM does not broker, sell, or lease space directly and is not a party to any transaction between the provider and the family.

NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE
----------------------

All information, materials, content and/or advice on the Sites or provided through the Services is for informational purposes only and is not intended to replace or substitute for any professional, financial, medical, legal, or other advice. APFM expressly disclaims, and you expressly release APFM from, any and all liability concerning any treatment, action by, or effect on any person following the information offered or provided within or through the Sites and/or Services. You should consult with an appropriately trained and licensed specialist for all concerns that require medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice.

PRIVACY AND CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS

GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM SELECTION
---------------------------------

Any dispute arising from the Site and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in New York County, New York.

CLAIMS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION, CLASS WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please read the following important section carefully.

Except for small claims disputes or claims related to intellectual property, you and we waive our rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to the Sites or Services resolved in court. Instead, disputes relating in any way to the Sites or Services must be submitted to binding arbitration administered by JAMS. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are hereby incorporated by reference.

You and we agree that any dispute arising out of or related to the Sites or our Services is personal to you and us and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.

You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You have the right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email to privacy@aplaceformom.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the section, “Governing Law and Forum Selection.”

If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.

If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by us infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a written notice that includes the following information.

GENERAL TERMS
-------------

If any part of the Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use will continue in effect.
