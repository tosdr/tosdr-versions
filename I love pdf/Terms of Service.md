------------

### 2.1 General

iLovePDF accounts give the user access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. The different account types allow the user to work within different file size and file number limitations.

You are responsible for whatever is done on your Account, so make sure you have a strong password and don't let anyone else use it.

* * *

3\. User Content
----------------

### 3.1 General

iLovePDF does not analyse the content of files whilst processing them and only Users will have access to the edited files once iLovePDF has processed them. If chosen by the user, this link can be shared with someone else. iLovePDF will automatically delete processed files from their servers after a defined period of time depending on the tool used:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Merge PDF | 2 hours |
| Split PDF | 2 hours |
| Remove Pages | 2 hours |
| Extract Pages | 2 hours |
| Organize PDF | 2 hours |
| Compress PDF | 2 hours |
| Repair PDF | 2 hours |

Users bear the sole responsibility for the usage of their own files.

iLovePDF is limited to offer users access to their own processed files. These files will only remain stored on our servers during the time that the download link is available.

### 3.2 Content manipulation

iLovePDF provides all the necessary information to assist the user in processing files, and only the User is responsible for contacting iLovePDF in case of technical problems. iLovePDF is highly concerned about file security, thus its servers have limited access, are secured and strategically placed. User will be able to modify his User type or cancel his account at any time, by means of the contact form.

### 3.3 Responsibility for the content of the files

iLovePDF does not analyze the content of processed files and thus is not responsible for its tools misuse nor copyright infringements which may affect third- parties. The User will be responsible before iLovePDF of any penalty, sanction, and/or fine which the courts or other competent authorities could issue against iLovePDF for noncompliance with any part of this Agreement.

In particular, users agree to use the Service in conformity with current laws and conformant to the rules aforementioned in section 1.1.

We don't access nor analyze your content. Before any technical issue, it's your responsibility to contact us. We are not responsible for the content of your files. You are the only person responsible for whatever they may contain.

* * *

4\. Signature
-------------

### 4.1 How it works

iLovePDF Signature permits documents to be signed electronically by signatory's self or one can request for signatures from other signatories by means of email delivery. Signatories will have the ability to review the document before proceeding with the application of an electronic signature. "Signatory" means a natural person who creates an electronic signature.

Signatory has two electronic signature options:

* Simple electronic signature (defined as "data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign; in sum is the signature that allows the signer to be digitally identified with their data but does not offer a minimum level of security").
    
* Advanced electronic signature (defined as "an electronic signature which meet the following requirements: (a) it is uniquely linked to the signatory; (b) it is capable of identifying the signatory; (c) it is created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of confidence, use under his sole control; and (d) it is linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable)
    

The requester has the option to send a simple electronic signature request or can activate the advanced electronic signature option in order to place an EIDAS listed TimeStamp for added legal validity.

In addition to the final version of the document, in advanced electronic signature we provide an Audit Trail that includes details gathered from the requester as well as the signers in order to provide greater transparency to the entire process.

All documents containing advanced electronic signatures are stored in iLovePDF's servers for safekeeping for procurement purposes.

Please note that once the signature process is complete, it is you who have the sole authority to safeguard the documents.

### 4.2 Legal Guarantees

The electronic signature services provided by iLovePDF are regulated by Spanish and European Laws, particularly, by EU Regulation 910/2014 ("eIDAS Regulation"), directly applicable in all member countries of the European Union, and Spanish Law 6/2020 (trusted electronic services) where iLovePDF is located. Services could also comply with the requirements of the U.S. Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act of 2000 (ESIGN), and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) or other Laws in many jurisdictions . However, iLovePDF disclaims any liability in this regard and it's the Signatory's sole responsibility to confirm and ensure the suitability and fitness of the Signature service for its purposes and legal requirements and laws in the country or region in which the signature takes place. Electronic signatures may have different legal standards depending on the jurisdiction.

iLovePDF, in case of advance signature, provides a detailed audit trail, timestamps, and signature biometric tracing which are held into account in legal proceedings.

iLovePDF is at disposition to provide the advanced electronically signed document as well as audit trail if required by a court of law (and in case iLovePDF still preserves this information), yet exempts itself from prosecution if the document is not upheld or found lacking.

### 4.3 Pricing

iLovePDF offers two different kinds of signatures: simple electronic signatures and advanced electronic signatures. Simple electronic signatures are free of use. Signatures may be subject to size or quantity limitations of processing (see pricing for more information). We offer a certain number of advanced electronic signatures at no extra cost for our Premium users each month. We also provide prepaid packs of advanced electronic signatures which can be purchased. Advanced electronic signatures sold in packs can be used on top of those obtained with your subscription or other packs you have previously purchased.

### 4.4 Collected Information

For the sake of full transparency throughout the signature process, iLovePDF may collect the following information for the processing of the signature and audit trail, and would be visible by all parties involved:

* Name of requester, signer, validator, and witness.
    
* Email of requester, signer, validator, and witness.
    
* Phone number of signer which needs SMS code validation.
    
* Name of file(s) being signed.
    
* IP of requester, signer, validator, and witness.
    
* Biometric data of requester, signer, validator, and witness.
    

iLovePDF's signature tool, ("Sign PDF") has additional attributes in terms of usage and legal status. iLovePDF offers these services to you to sign documents electronically. iLovePDF is not responsible for and will not be liable for determining whether you may use an eSignature or not to complete any legal requirement that you may use the services for. Please read this entire section carefully before proceeding to use the Sign PDF tool.

5\. Paid Services
-----------------

### 5.1 Billing Policies

Becoming Premium is only possible by paid subscription. Subscriptions start when first payment is made. These are recurring billing transactions. Unless otherwise stated, your subscription and the relevant billing authorization will continue indefinitely until canceled by you. By paid subscription, you authorize us to bill you for the service purchased at the acquisition Price. The billing rate is subject to change during the subscription period. However, existent Premium users would pay the same amount that the billing rate subscribed. Payment will be charged to your payment method until you cancel your subscription unless stated otherwise. Your service will be billed each period based on the acquisition date and cost. You may cancel your subscription at any time, but the cancellation will not become effective until the end of the current billing period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period. Any unused portion of a free Premium trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when purchasing a subscription. We reserve the right to issue refunds or at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.

### 5.2 Refunds

You may cancel your Premium account at any time; however, there are no refunds for cancellation. In the event that iLovePDF suspends or terminates your account or this Agreement, you understand and agree that you shall receive no refund or exchange for any credits, any unused time on a subscription and any license or subscription fees for any portion of the Service.

### 5.3 Payment information, taxes

All information provided by the User in connection with a purchase or transaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your payment method used in connection with a purchase or with the Service. You will pay applicable taxes, if any, relating to your purchases.

### 5.4 Free Trial

This offer (the "Offer"), which is made to you by iLovePDF (as defined in the iLovePDF Terms and Conditions of Use), entitles you access to the iLovePDF Premium Service (as defined in the iLovePDF Terms and Conditions of Use) for a period of seven (7) days from the moment that you activate such trial period by submitting your payment details (the "Free Trial Period"). By submitting your payment details, (i) you accept the Offer, (ii) consent to us using your payment details in accordance with our Privacy Policy, (iii) acknowledge and agree to iLovePDF Terms and Conditions of Use and these Offer Terms and Conditions. If you decide that you do not want to become a paying user of the iLovePDF Premium Service, you have to cancel your subscription to the Premium Service by logging into your iLovePDF account prior to the end of your Free Trial Period. Otherwise, at the end of your Free Trial Period, you will automatically become a paying user of the iLovePDF Premium Service, and the payment method you provided will automatically be charged the current iLovePDF Premium subscription fee each month/year until you cancel your Premium Service subscription. It is very important to understand that you will receive a confirmation notice from iLovePDF that your free trial is expiring and that payment for your subscription is due in 7-Days. Payments are nonrefundable. If you cancel, you will not receive a refund, including for partially used periods of Service. There are circumstances where iLovePDF may provide refunds on a case by case basis. The decision to provide them is at iLovePDF's sole and absolute discretion. If you cancel your subscription during a free trial, the cancellation will be effective immediately, and you will automatically convert to the Free Service. You may only use this Offer once. If you have subscribed to the Premium service or have taken a trial offer previously, you are ineligible for this Offer. iLovePDF reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to modify this Offer at any time without prior notice and with no liability.

Unless otherwise stated, your subscription will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you. Refunds won't have a retroactive effect. You are responsible to pay your taxes associated with our services.

12\. Miscellaneous
------------------

### 12.1 General

The User will not be able to cede, subrogate, or transmit the rights contained in the current Contract to third parties without the previous written consent of iLovePDF. Same as the previous point. We are a registered trademark, you can't copy our brand identity.

The offense or delay in the exercise of any right or in the demand for the completion of any of the obligations arising from this Contract will not constitute a renunciation of that right or demand for the completion of the obligation, nor the renunciation of any other rights or demands for the completion of obligations. This Contract, including the Privacy Policy which will be incorporated for reference into the current Contract, constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between the parties in relation to the object of the Contract, and substitutes any of the previous agreements or negotiations between said parties. If any of the clauses of the present Contract might become null due to a contravention of the applicable legislation, said clause will be assumed not to be in effect, but will not affect the rest of the Contract, which will be assumed to be in full effectivity and validity between the parties.

These Terms and Conditions are the only agreement between both parties (yourself and us), and will be the only one taken into consideration.

13\. Applicable legislation and jurisdiction
--------------------------------------------

### 13.1 General

The current Contract has a commercial character and should be interpreted and complied with according to its terms, and, in case of the unexpected, will be regulated by Spanish law. In the steps permitted by governing laws, for the resolution of any controversies deriving from the validity, interpretation, completion, or execution of this Contract, the parties, with express resignation to any other jurisdiction to which they may correspond, expressly subject themselves to the jurisdiction and power of the judges and courts of the city of Barcelona.

This contract has to be interpreted according to its own terms. In case of dispute, it will be regulated according with the Spanish Law. Honestly, this is the last thing we'd like to happen so let's have a good time here.
