We will then endeavour to provide assistance to our customers to address concerns you may have in accordance with the terms of our contract with such customer. A common example of where we process Personal Data in such a manner is in connection with our player support services where an individual may have submitted a support request (which may include Personal Data such as a name, email address, user ID, etc.) to a company that uses our customer support technology or services however in such circumstances, the company should be contacted and we can assist with such communications to the extent possible.

2\. How We Share Your Personal Data
-----------------------------------

We disclose your Personal Data to the categories of service providers and other parties listed in this section. Depending on state laws that may be applicable to you, some of these disclosures may constitute a “sale” of your Personal Data. For more information, please refer to the state-specific sections below.

##### Service Providers

We will share Personal Data with our service providers or other entities acting as Keywords’ agents or data processors for the purposes of providing services to Keywords and on the understanding that Personal Data will be processed in line with legal obligations imposed. These parties help us to provide the Website and/or Services or to perform business functions on our behalf. They include hosting, technology and communication providers.

##### Customers

We will share Personal Data with our customers to enable them to carry out the obligations under the contract that we have with our customers and other commercial partners where agreed.  Note that we will only share your Personal Data with the specific customer that contracted with Keywords to make the Services available unless otherwise agreed.

##### Legal Obligations

We may share any Personal Data where this is required by law or regulation, or court or administrative order having force of law, or where required by any of Keywords’ regulators.

##### Business Transfers

All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a different entity, and our legal or other advisors, if we undergo, or evaluate, a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction (or proposed transaction) in which that entity assumes control of our business or assets of our business (in whole or in part).

##### Data that is Not Personal Data

We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data that we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not share such data in a manner that could identify you.

3\. Transfers of Personal Data
------------------------------

We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data that we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not share such data in a manner that could identify you.

Many of the countries will be within the EEA or will be ones which the European Commission has approved and will have data privacy laws which are the same as or broadly equivalent to those in the European Union. However, some transfers may be to countries which do not have equivalent protections, and, in that case, Keywords will use reasonable efforts to implement contractual protections for the Personal Data. While this may not always be possible, any transfers will be done in accordance with applicable data privacy laws, including through the implementation of appropriate or suitable safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, in accordance with such applicable data privacy laws. In particular, Keywords is a party to an Intra-Group Data Transfer Agreement which governs the transfer of Personal Data across all members of the Keywords Group in a manner consistent with the requirements of the applicable data privacy laws.

4\. Data Security and Retention
-------------------------------

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that Personal Data. Although we work to protect the security of your data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. In general, Keywords (or its service providers on its behalf) will hold this information for a period of seven years after you cease to interact with us, unless we are obliged to hold it for a longer period under law or applicable regulations. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

5\. Automated Decisions
-----------------------

Automated decisions are defined as decisions about individuals that are based solely on the automated processing of data and that produce legal effects that significantly affect the individuals involved. Keywords does not make automated decisions in relation to you or to your Personal Data. If automated decisions are made, the affected persons will be given an opportunity to express their views on the automated decision in question and to object to it.

6\. Third Party Website/Services
--------------------------------

The Website may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Website. These other websites are not under Keywords control, and such links do not constitute an endorsement by Keywords of those other websites or the services offered through them. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Service are not covered by this Privacy Notice, and Keywords is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

7\. Personal Data of Children

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data about children under 16 years of age without specifically notifying such data subjects and their guardians that such Personal Data may be collected and processed in a specific instance. In such instances, details regarding the legal basis for such processing and any potential uses of such Personal Data will be provided. If you are a child under the age of 16, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn that we have incidentally collected Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, other than for a specific purpose where they have been information of the purpose and legal basis for collection, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.helpshift.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

8\. Your Rights in relation to Personal Data

If you come to our site from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, or if you clear your cookies, you will need to opt-out again, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well.
* **Limit Use and Disclosure**: We do not engage in uses of sensitive Personal Data that would trigger a _right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information_ under applicable state privacy law.

You may designate someone as an authorized agent to submit requests and act on your behalf.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Therefore, we will need your first and last name, email address, and, if applicable, customer number. In some cases, we may request additional information to verify your identity, or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will explain the basis for the denial.
