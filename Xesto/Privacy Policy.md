**XESTO Privacy Policy**
------------------------

**Effective date: July 31, 2020**

Welcome to Xesto ("Xesto," "we," "us" or "our"), a foot sizing and shoe recommendation service.

This Privacy Policy explains how we, the shoe brands we work with (“**Customers”**), and the consumer who use Xesto (“**Consumers**”) (both together referred to as “users“, “you” or “your”) collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile applications, web sites, and any software or software integrations provided on or in connection with Xesto services (collectively, the "**Service**").

By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for capturing images of Consumers’ feet, from which we derive 3D models and dimensional measurements (“**Consumer Measure Data**”) in order to provide measure data and match recommendations ("**Consumer Match Data**") from information provided by Customers through the Service about specific shoe models (“**Product Data**”), and to share Measure and Match Data with you, subject to the permissions granted by Consumers.

This Policy applies to all users who access the Service. In providing the Service, we collect information provided directly by Customers and information about Consumers captured indirectly through the Xesto app, and from Consumers directly through a consumer web portal. We, Customers and Consumers are bound by the terms and permissions granted by Customers and Consumers under this Privacy Policy.

#### **Information we collect directly from Customers about specific company, user, product and other information is shared only with that Customer and never shared other Customers or with third parties outside Xesto (or the group of companies of which Xesto is a part) without consent of that Customer, except as noted in this Policy.**

#### **Information we collect directly and indirectly from Consumers is shared with Customers only with permission from each user and never shared with third parties outside Xesto (or the group of companies of which Xesto is a part) without consent of that Consumer, except as noted in this Policy.**  

Customers may see or use Consumer information that is made available through the Service, on a limited basis and subject to permissions granted by individual Consumers, consistent with the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

#### **1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect the following types of information:

#### **Information Customers provide us directly about their company and staff:**

· Information provided by the Customer (e.g., company name, address, store locations, usernames, passwords, etc).  
‍  
· Information captured through the Xesto app (“**App Data**”) (e.g., salesperson, store location, time, etc)  
‍  
· Communications between Xesto and the Customer. For example, we may send them Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, training information, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that Customers may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.

#### **Information Customers provide us directly about products and customers:**

· Information about Customers’ products (“**Product Data**”) (e.g., images, models, sizes, cost, price, inventory quantity and location, etc)  
‍  
· Results of physical shoe fit tests (“**Fit Data**”) performed by us and/or Customers matching Consumers to Customer products.  
‍  
· Information about Customers’ existing customers from eCommerce and other records.

#### **Information Consumers provide us directly and indirectly through the Service:**

· Consumer Profile Data acquired through the Service (e.g., name, phone number, email address, etc).  
‍  
· Consumer Measure Data (including fit preferences, photos, 3D renderings of feet and measurements derived from them) captured through the Service and through other means. Xesto uses the Camera API to capture photos using the front RGB camera and the TrueDepth API to obtain depth maps and RGB frames (from the front-facing TrueDepth camera) that are used to create 3D models of consumer feet. The RGB and depth images of your feet are gathered from your device, only after receiving your additional consent. The images will be recorded by the TrueDepth camera (TrueDepth is a trademark of Apple Inc.). Xesto will use the information we collect to make recommendations through our services for you, including providing dimension information and size recommendations. We also use the information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.  
‍  
· Consumer Match Data derived from relating specific Consumer Data to specific Product Data.

#### **Information Consumers provide us directly:**

· Additional Consumer Profile Data (e.g., passwords, permissions, demographic details, etc) captured through the XESTO consumer web portal.

#### **Information we collect automatically:  
  
Analytics, Cookies and Log File information:**

· We use third party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends of the Service. The information collected, which includes device and user interaction data, helps us improve the Service. The analytics information collected is aggregated and not traced back to particular users.  
‍  
· When you are using the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies such as local storage to collect information about your account and use of the Service.  
‍  
· Log file information is automatically reported by devices used with the Service when users access the Service. When using the Service, we log errors and other non-user sensitive information in order to improve the Service. Log information may include device and locality information.

#### **Device identifiers:**

·   When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on the device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with a mobile device, which uniquely identify a mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by XESTO.  
‍  
· A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how users use the Service and may help us derive and provide reports. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

#### **Metadata:**

· Metadata is collected, usually in association with the process of capturing and rendering images of Consumers’ feet. This data may include the device information, the user information and/or location information.

#### **2\. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:  
‍  
· Help Customers and Consumers efficiently access information after signing in.  
‍  
· Remember information so Customers and Consumers will not have to re-enter it during a visit or the next time visiting the Service  
‍  
· Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service  
‍  
· Develop and test new products and features  
‍  
· Monitor metrics such as total number of customers and demographic patterns  
‍  
· Diagnose or fix technology problems  
‍  
· Automatically update the Xesto application on devices

#### **3\. SHARING OF INFORMATION  
‍  
Parties with whom we may share information Customers provide us directly:**

‍  
· If information posted to the Service by Customers or Consumers is removed, copies may remain in the Service, or if other users or third parties using the Service have copied or saved that information.

But these Affiliates will honour the terms of our privacy Policies and Terms of Use.  
‍  
· We also may share Customer and Consumer information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and metadata, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service ("Service Providers").
