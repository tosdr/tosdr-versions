#### 25\. Termination.

PMC may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services or the Servicesâ services at any time. PMC may restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services and/or its services if we believe you are in breach of our Terms of Use or applicable law, or for any other reason without notice or liability.

#### 26\. Dispute Resolution: Binding Arbitration Clause and Class Waiver.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTSâINCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT (BY REQUIRING YOUR DISPUTE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION) AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHTS TO RESOLVE YOUR DISPUTE AS PART OF A CLASS.

As detailed herein, the Terms of Use mandate that all disputes between you and PMC be resolved first through an informal dispute resolution process. In the event informal resolution fails, the Terms of Use further mandate that all disputes (except those identified in Section 26.3) be formally resolved through binding arbitration. Binding arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve such disputes. Consequently, you should read the entirety of Section 26 carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights.

#### 26.1 Informal Dispute Resolution.

For any and all disputes between you and PMC, the parties shall use their best efforts to settle informally the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and to engage in good faith negotiations. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration.

To initiate informal dispute resolution, the initiating party must first send a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute against PMC that you initiate, you agree to send to PMC (a) a written description of the dispute and (b) the email address(es) associated with your account through the following email address: [**legal@pmc.com**](mailto:legal@pmc.com). The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. For any dispute that PMC initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your use of the Services.

If the partiesâ dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute by a party, you and PMC agree to resolve any remaining dispute through the additional dispute resolution provisions set forth below.

A good faith engagement in informal dispute resolution shall be and is a prerequisite and condition precedent to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. The parties agree that any applicable statute of limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

#### 26.2 Binding Arbitration

After the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve their dispute(s) in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution process (Section 26.1), and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate arbitration as set forth in this Section.

If you determine to initiate arbitration, a copy of the arbitration demand must be emailed to [**legal@pmc.com**](mailto:legal@pmc.com). If PMC is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your use of the PMC Services.

**(a) Mutual Arbitration Agreement**  
Except as set forth in Section 26.3 below, you and PMC agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, formation, or performance of these Terms of Useâ including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or timing of any administrative or arbitrator feesâshall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 26.2 (collectively, the âArbitration Agreementâ). The arbitrator shall be empowered under this Arbitration Agreement to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the arbitration providerâs rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a partyâs failure to comply with this Section 26.2.

This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice opt-out provisions set forth in Sections 26.4 and 26.5.

This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ) in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and PMC expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.

Except as set forth in Section 26.2(c) below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the partiesâ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.

**(b) WAIVER OF RIGHTS INCLUDING JURY TRIAL**  
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COST OF LITIGATION IN SOME INSTANCES.

YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND PMC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

**(c) CLASS ARBITRATION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER.**  
YOU AND PMC ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 26.2(c) AND SECTION 26.2(e)(vi) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTYâS CLAIM; NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT, ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IF AND ONLY IF PMC PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.

If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraphâs limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.

If there is a final judicial determination that either the Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver in this Section, or that the provisions in this Section 26.2 are not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court as provided herein, but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or PMC from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

**(d) Arbitration Location.**  
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in the county where you reside. For residents in Canada (and anywhere else outside the United States), arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, unless you and PMC otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue.

For any arbitration conducted in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, You and PMC agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. or certified mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available

**(e) The Arbitration Rules.**

#### (i) The Provider.

The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (âNAMâ) and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.

Except as modified by this âDispute Resolutionâ provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at [**http://www.namadr.com**](http://www.namadr.com/) or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediationâs Commercial Dept at [**commercial@namadr.com**](mailto:commercial@namadr.com).

You are responsible for your own attorneysâ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAMâs Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 26 while such challenge remains pending before NAM the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.

#### (ii) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Information.

Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting partyâs identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms of Use. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms of Use.

#### (iii) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Circumstances.

If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and PMC submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.

#### (iv) Dispositive Motions.

Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.

#### (v) Batching.

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 26.2(e)(i) if NAM is unavailable) against PMC within reasonably close temporal proximity (âMass Filingâ), the parties agree (A) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (B) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (C) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with 26.2(e)(i) if NAM is unavailable) in its discretion; (D) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (E) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by PMC and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (F) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of limitation applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or settled.

Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.

**You agree to cooperate in good faith with PMC and the arbitration provider to implement such a âbatch approachâ or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.** The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. For example, if the number of cases filed makes batches of 100 cases too small for the prompt resolution of all filed claims, you and we agree that NAM may increase or decrease the batch size, or transfer a case between batches in the reasoned discretion of the NAM procedural arbitrator. Any and all disagreements between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a NAM procedural arbitrator.

This âBatch Arbitrationâ provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAMâs Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind.

#### (vi) No Class or Consolidated Arbitration Absent Written Consent.

Unless PMC otherwise consents in writing, which it may do on a case-by-case basis, PMC does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in Section 26.2(c) and this Section 26.2(e)(vi).

#### (vii) Arbitration Award.

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitratorâs decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with Section 26.2(c) above, and also must be consistent with the terms of the âLimitation of Liabilityâ section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneysâ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.

#### 26.3 Exceptions to Arbitration.

Notwithstanding the partiesâ agreement to resolve all disputes through binding arbitration as set forth in Section 26.2:

#### (a) IP Disputes.

Either partyâs claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâs patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in the City and County of New York, New York.

#### (b) Small Claims Court and Statutes of Limitation.

Either party may elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose, provided the disputes or claims are within the scope of that courtâs jurisdiction.

Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a partyâs claims are time-barred or may be in fact be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a partyâs right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.

#### (c) Jurisdiction/Service of Process.

For any dispute not subject to arbitration under this Section 26, you and PMC agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York. You further agree to accept service of process by U.S. or certified mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

#### 26.4 30-Day Right to Opt Out.

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice, signed by you, of your decision to opt-out to the following address: privacydirector@pmc.com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of March 30, 2023 or your first use of the Services, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of Section 26.2. If you opt-out of the arbitration provisions, PMC also will not be bound by them.

If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If PMC changes this âDispute Resolutionâ section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by providing notice as described in Section 26.4.

PMC will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of arbitration in a prior version of the Terms pursuant to the requirements set forth in that version. If you do not timely opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of these âDispute Resolutionâ provisions by you and PMC.

â

#### 26.5 Changes to this Section.

PMC will provide 30 daysâ notice of the date of any material changes to this Section 26. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you continue to use the Services after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which PMC does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.

#### 27\. Miscellaneous.

These Terms of Use (including the Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the partiesâ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.

#### 28\. Supplemental Terms.

Getty Images Notice: Without limiting any of the terms set forth herein, Getty Images still images and visual representations (including, without limitation, Getty Images wholly-owned images and visual representations, as well as the collections licensed through Getty Images) may not be republished, retransmitted, reproduced, downloaded or otherwise used, except for downloading for personal, non-commercial use.
