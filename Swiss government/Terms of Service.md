Privacy Notice

### 1\. General Information

Your data are safe in our hands. The Federal Administration only collects the personal data that it needs to fulfil its tasks (data economy). Stored data are carefully managed and protected against any form of abuse.

Under Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and under federal data protection law, everyone is entitled to have their privacy protected and to have their personal data protected from abuse. The Federal Administration complies with these provisions on its web pages and when providing its web services.

### 2\. Scope of Application

This Privacy Notice applies to all pages on Federal Administration websites in the ‘admin.ch’ domain, to web pages operated by third parties on behalf of the Federal Administration and to the personal data collected via these web pages. This Privacy Notice may be amended at any time without prior notice. Where the Federal Administration web pages or pages operated on its behalf offer links to the web pages of other providers, the privacy information and policies of those providers apply to their own pages.

Individual units of the Federal Administration have their own or additional data protection provisions. Apps jointly developed by the Federal Administration may be subject to data protection provisions that cover their specific use. Please note: if you download an app, the operator of the app stores will normally be provided with your details.

### 3\. Links

The Federal Administration has no influence over external pages to which it provides links, nor over external pages that provide links to Federal Administration pages. Accordingly, the Federal Administration provides no guarantee in relation to such pages that the information they contain is accurate or that they are free of malware (such as viruses). Responsibility for the information and services provided on linked web pages or web services are entirely the responsibility of the third party concerned. The Federal Administration accepts no responsibility or liability for such web pages or web services.

### 4\. What happens to your data?

#### **a) Retention and erasure**

The processing of personal data on the web pages of the Confederation is limited to the data that are required to provide a properly functioning website and user-friendly content and services, or to the data that you have actively made available to us. The personal data that we collect is only retained for as long as they are needed in order to fulfil the purpose concerned. Certain data may be retained for longer in order to meet statutory requirements or other obligations.

#### b) Data stored when completing a form

If you complete a form on our website (e.g. a contact form), we process the data that you provide us to the extent that this is required to fulfil the purpose of processing or to deal with your request. Normally any information we receive is provided on a voluntary basis. Obligatory fields are only marked as such if the information is required in order to fulfil our statutory duty or to deal with your request or enquiry. These data are erased when the statutory retention period expires at the latest.

#### c) Data stored for the purpose of sending the newsletter

If you order a newsletter, the following data will be recorded: your email address (obligatory); any title, your first name and surname (all optional). Your personal data related to sending out the newsletters to which you subscribe will be erased immediately if you terminate your subscription.

#### d) Data stored for the purpose of web analysis

If you access the Federal Administration’s web pages and web services, the following data will be stored in log files: the IP address, date, time, browser request and the information transmitted relating to the device used, including the operating system and browser. These data are evaluated by web analysis tools (see below). The Federal Administration does this in order to continuously improve its methods of communication.

**Web analysis tools**: The Federal Administration uses the Matomo software solution as standard for web analysis not related to specific persons. Matomo is operated by the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT). The Federal Chancellery also operates a Matomo server. A managed server at Metanet (Schweiz) AG is used. Tracking is carried out using JavaScript and Pixel but only within the domain (admin.ch) and is completely under the Federal Administration’s control, with all data remaining in Switzerland. The data obtained is used exclusively for web analysis; they are not shared or combined with other data records.

Some federal offices use other tools for web analysis, such as Siteimprove. The data processing is carried out in other European countries in accordance with the GDPR ([Privacy Policy: Siteimprove Services](https://siteimprove.com/en/privacy/privacy-policy/)).
