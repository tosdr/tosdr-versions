What we do
==========

1\. Game Development
====================

We create games that last, taking your feedback to heart. We vow to **never** break any of our core values, no matter how large we become.

The values being: 

* **To not make a game that is deliberately “pay-to-win”  
    **  
    Games that incentivise paying to gain an advantage are not what we’re about. We will always have an alternative to paying to access something that is fair, and that has been playtested and designed in a way that it is accessible, whilst keeping gameplay entertaining.

* **To never deviate from our motto**  
    _  
    **Creativity, maintaining precision**_ is the motto we’ll always stick to. Rigorous testing and closed, _in some cases open_, beta testing and feedback assures that any finished product should never appear rushed, and all projects to always have a certain factor that doesn’t just make it a game, but a _T__inyPixel Game_.

* **To listen to you  
    **  
    We will always take feedback and take it extremely seriously, we already have with any of our previous projects. To submit a suggestion, simply contact us here

2\. Graphic & Logo Design
=========================

Something a bit newer in our catalogue, we offer a quick and memorable way to represent your brand. Following the latest design trends and standards, we can make your logo memorable and timeless to make sure you stick out from the crowd.

A proper workflow is key to a proper design, so that’s why our workflow has been refined and is always open to change if we find any new way to change it.

We research your brand, following any requirements you may have given us. We look at other similar brands, and note any common trends, while making sure to keep everything unique.

Blending into the previous step, we take notes of any other existing designs, and start to roughly make and sketch out the foundation of your new logo or design work. We keep in mind any guidelines you have provided to us!



Lastly, we take our sketches to our industry-standard tools to design your request to perfection. We review it several times, and work with you along the way. This may take the longest, but for a good reason; it’s where everything comes together.
