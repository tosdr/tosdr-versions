Digital Photography Review Conditions of Use
============================================

Last updated: June 20, 2023. To see prior version, click [here](https://www.dpreview.com/misc/termsandconditions2014).

Welcome to **dpreview.com** (and any successor website(s) as applicable) (collectively the "Web Site"). We provide website content and features to you subject to the following conditions. **If you visit the Web Site, you accept these conditions.** If you do not agree, you have no right to use this Web Site.

THESE CONDITIONS OF USE INCLUDE A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNLESS YOU OPT-OUT AS PROVIDED IN THE DISPUTES SECTION BELOW.

### Copyright

All the information and content (such as text, design, layout, graphics, photos, images, logos, buttons, audio clips, video clips, digital downloads, data compilations, and software) included on this Web Site are the property of Gear Patrol, LLC doing business as DPReview ("we," "us" or "our"), and its affiliates or its photographers, users and content suppliers and are protected by the copyright and trademark laws of the United States, United Kingdom and other countries. The compilation of all content on this Web Site is our exclusive property and is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. All software used on this Web Site is our property or the property of our licensors and protected by United States and international copyright laws.

This Web Site and any of its contents may not be copied, translated or distributed in any manner (electronic, web or printed) without our prior written consent. To inquire with the Web Site for such consent, please [contact us](https://www.dpreview.com/feedback?category=general&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.dpreview.com%2fmisc%2ftermsandconditions). We actively seek out copyright violations on the Internet and in print and will use full legal force to deal with any infringement of our rights. The only exception to this rule is linking to articles (see below).

### Trademarks

DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW, the DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW logo, DPREVIEW and DPREVIEW.COM and any other marks indicated on the Web Site are all trademarks of ours in the United States and/or other countries. Other www.dpreview.com graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names are trademarks or trade dress of ours. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not ours, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that disparages or discredits us. All other trademarks not owned by us that appear on this Web Site are the property of their respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to, or sponsored by us.

### Copyright Complaints

We respect the intellectual property of others. Portions of this Web Site may publish readers' comments and opinion (notably the discussion forums). We do not assume or have any responsibility or any liability for the readers' comments or opinions, nor do we claim ownership or copyright that belongs to the original poster.

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may request that the material be removed or that access to it be blocked through our [feedback form](https://www.dpreview.com/feedback?category=general&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.dpreview.com%2fmisc%2ftermsandconditions). Your request must contain all of the following requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA"):

* An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest
* A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon
* A description where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Web Site
* Your address, telephone number, and email address
* A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law
* A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf

If you believe that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must be submitted via our [feedback form](https://www.dpreview.com/feedback?category=general&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.dpreview.com%2fmisc%2ftermsandconditions) and contain the same requirements bulleted above. Notices and counter-notices must meet the statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before submitting a notice or counter-notice. Please be aware that there can be substantial penalties for false claim. Please note that this procedure is exclusively for notifying us that your copyrighted material has been infringed.

### License and Web Site Access

We grant you a limited license to access and make personal use of the Web Site and not to download (other than page caching) or modify it, or any portion of it, except with our express written consent or as expressly described in these Conditions of Use. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of this Web Site or its contents; any collection and use of any reviews, product descriptions, or images; any derivative use of this Web Site or its contents; or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. This Web Site or any portion of this site may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our express written consent. Any unauthorized use terminates the permission or license granted by us.

### Linking to DPReview Articles

You may not use any graphic or portion of graphic without our written permission. To inquire with the Web Site for such permission, please [contact us](https://www.dpreview.com/feedback?category=general&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.dpreview.com%2fmisc%2ftermsandconditions). Nor may you use images of captures (either screen or window) of the Web Site's webpages.

Example of allowable links may be:

> **New digital camera from xyz company**  
> Xyz company today announced their new camera, it's got 200 megapixels and a 40 times optical zoom, expected to be aimed at prosumer owners. - dpreview.com  
> \[Read the news article over at dpreview.com\]

> **Xyz Super SLR reviewed**

> \[Read the whole review over at dpreview.com\]

### Hot linking

"Hot linking" refers to the practice of inserting a link in a piece of HTML to an image on another server. Due to a recent rash of people using hot linking to our copyrighted images in numerous ways, such as on their own web pages, in articles, on commercial sites, and in ebay auctions, we have had to put a technical block on the serving of images from the Web Site. Images can now only be seen where they were intended, on pages within this Web Site. Hot linking takes server time, control, copyright and bandwidth away from the real users of this Web Site and we will not allow it. If you would like to use an image from the Web Site please contact us first and ask permission.

### Comments, Communications, Images and Other Content

The Web Site contains bulletin board services, buy/sell forums, news groups, forums, and other services, features, message or communication facilities on the Web Site (collectively the "Services") designed to enable you to communicate with others. You agree to use those Services only to submit or post messages and material that are proper and, when applicable, related to the particular Service, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights or otherwise objectionable material of any kind. Content for the Services that consists of or contains software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" is prohibited. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of your posted content for the Services. We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content for the Services, but do not regularly review such posted content. We may terminate your access, or suspend access to all or part of the Web Site and/or Services, without notice, for any conduct that we, in our sole discretion, believe is in violation of these Conditions of Use or other terms applicable to the Web Site or any services offered thereon, any applicable law, or is harmful to the interests of another user, service provider, or the Web Site.

You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content for the Services that you post or upload; that such content is accurate; that use of such content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify us for all claims resulting from such content you supply. More specifically, you are entirely responsible for each individual item of content that you post, email or otherwise make available via the Web Site.

We have the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content in connection with the Services. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any content for the Services posted by you or any third party.

With respect to photographic content that you submit or make available for inclusion, you grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to use, distribute, reproduce, publicly perform, and to publicly display such content on the Web Site or any of our affiliates web sites or mobile applications. The license to photographic content granted by the immediately preceding sentence exists only for as long as you choose to keep your photographic content on the Web Site. For content that you submit and designate for Private Access Only, we will not permit third parties other than ourselves and those users who you grant access to view such Private Access Only content.

A "Posting Agent" is a third-party agent, service, or intermediary that offers to post content to the Web Site on behalf of others. To moderate demands on our resources, you may not use a Posting Agent to post content to the Web Site without express permission or license from us. Correspondingly, Posting Agents are not permitted to post content on behalf of others, to cause content to be so posted, or otherwise access the Web Site to facilitate posting content on behalf of others, except with express permission or license from us.

CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

### Applicable Law

By visiting the Web Site, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us.

### Disputes

**Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Web Site, goods, or services sold or distributed by or through the Web Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,** except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

1. **There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.**
2. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company c/o Gear Patrol, LLC d.b.a. DPReview, 80 State Street, Albany, NY 12207-2543. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
3. **You and the Web Site each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.** If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration **you and the Web Site each waive any right to a jury trial.** Both parties also agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
4. You may opt-out of binding arbitration and/or the class action waiver within 30 days from the date you created your account on the Web Site (or first accessed the Web Site, if you have not created an account) (the "Opt-Out Deadline") by submitting a request via our [feedback form](https://www.dpreview.com/feedback?category=general&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.dpreview.com%2fmisc%2ftermsandconditions) and clearly stating that you wish to opt out of the biding arbitration and/or class action waiver in the Conditions of Use. Any opt-out received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you will be required to pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court and be prohibited from pursuing your claim via class action.

### Modification and Severability

We reserve the right to make changes to the Web Site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time, which shall be binding on you when posted on the Web Site. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
