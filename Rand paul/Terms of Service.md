Mobile Terms of Service
=======================

### **Mobile Messaging Terms & Conditions**

Rand Paul for US Senate (“We,” “Us,” “Our”) is offering a mobile messaging program (the “Program”), subject to these Mobile Messaging Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”). If you do not wish to continue participating in the program or no longer agree to these Terms, you can reply “STOP” to any mobile message from Us in order to opt out of the Program.

**User Opt In:** The Program allows users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by users affirmatively opting into the Program, such as through online enrollment forms. Regardless of the opt-in method you utilized to join the Program, you agree that these Terms apply to your participation in the Program. The mobile messaging service used by Us to communicate with you requires human intervention for Our mobile messages to be initiated, and thus Our mobile messages are not sent to you by an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”). Nevertheless, by participating in the Program, you agree to receive autodialed marketing mobile messages and you understand that consent is not required to make any purchase from Us.

**Program Description:** Without limiting the scope of the Program, users that opt into the Program can expect to receive messages concerning campaign updates & donation information.

**Cost and Frequency:** Message and data rates may apply. The Program involves recurring mobile messages, and additional mobile messages may be sent based on your interaction with Us.

**Contact Information:** For support text “HELP” to any of Our mobile messages, or email info@randpaul4sen.com.

**User Opt Out and Additional Commands:** To opt out (discontinue participation in Program), reply “STOP” to any of Our mobile messages from your mobile device. This is the easiest and preferred method to opt out of the Program. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision to opt out. You may also opt out by texting “QUIT”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “UNSUBSCRIBE”, or “STOP ALL” to any of Our mobile messages you receive, or by contacting Us via the means provided above and clearly communicating your intent to unsubscribe from the Program. For additional support, text “HELP” to any of Our mobile messages you receive or email info@randpaul4sen.com.

**Our Warranty:** We will not be liable for any delays or failures in the receipt of any mobile messages connected with this Program. Delivery of mobile messages is subject to effective transmission from your wireless service provider/network operator, and is outside of Our control. T-Mobile is not liable for delayed or undelivered mobile messages.

**Term of Use & Privacy Policy:** By opting into the Program or otherwise sharing your personal information with Us in connection with the Program, you expressly consent to Our Terms of Service, https://randpaul.com/mobile-tos/, and to Our Privacy Policy, https://randpaul.com/privacy-policy/, including but not limited to, Our use, sharing, exchange and/or disclosure of your information as further outlined therein.

**Miscellaneous:** You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be subject to these Terms unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. From time to time, we may update these Terms, and We encourage you to periodically check these Terms for updates. Your continued participation in the Program affirms your agreement to any changes we make to these Terms.
