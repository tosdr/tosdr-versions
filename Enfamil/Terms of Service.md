Information for Non-U.S. Internet Users
---------------------------------------

All Mead Johnson Nutrition products, materials and information appearing on this website are intended for U.S. customers only. For relevant information about the products in another country, please see the specific website for that country. The specific Mead Johnson Nutrition products shown on this website may not be available for distribution or sale outside the U.S. Mead Johnson Nutrition endorses the aim of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes in developing countries, including standards for product integrity, labeling, distribution, and promotion. In accordance with Article 4.2 of the WHO Code, the following statement applies:

“Breastfeeding is best for infants and is preferred whenever possible. Breastfeeding is an important part of health, nutrition, and other social measures required to promote health, growth and development of infants and children. If a mother elects to formula-feed her infant, reversal of her decision may be difficult. Partial feeding with [infant formula](https://www.enfamil.com/products/newborn-infant-formula/) could have a negative effect on establishment of breastfeeding. Inappropriate use of breast milk substitutes may lead to infant malnutrition, serious illness, and even death in all countries.”

Misuse of breast milk substitutes poses health hazards, therefore, read and follow preparation and storage instructions carefully. Breastfeeding involves additional nutritional requirements for lactating mothers. It is important, therefore, that a nursing mother have an adequate diet to ensure that the quantity and nutritional quality of her milk is adequate for her baby. Formula, when used properly, provides a sound nutritious substitute or supplement to breast milk, but it is more expensive. When deciding how to feed your baby, professional advice should be followed and cost of formula considered.

The names of Mead Johnson Nutrition products shown on this site are trademarks of Mead Johnson Nutrition (or of a licensor where stated), many of which are registered in the U.S. and in various other countries.
