Noon VPN Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
============================================

This Terms of Service document (the “**Terms**”) outlines the terms and conditions of use of the VPN services (the “**Services**” or “**Service**”) provided by Noon VPN International Ltd. (“**NoonVPN**”). These Terms also govern the use of and access to Noon VPN’s content (the “**Content**”), which includes the NoonVPN website (the “**Site**”), applications (the “**Apps**”), and any software provided by NoonVPN (the “**Software**”).

By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to the Privacy Policy (“**Privacy Policy**”).

**Acceptance**

By accessing the Content or Services, you are agreeing on behalf of yourself or those you represent (“**you**”) to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms in their entirety. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (the “**Agreement**”) between you and NoonVPN. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.

By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age or that you are a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.

**Privacy Policy**

NoonVPN is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries from Subscribers connected to our VPN. During your registration, we may collect some sensitive personal information, such as your email address and payment information. We only collect information that are necessary for the proper delivery of the Site and Services.

For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the Privacy Policy, which is available on the Site. Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data.

We only collect the data when user contacts via email or WhatsApp. Email and WhatsApp are used for communication with users. Also, the contact data is not shared with any third-party.

**Subscriptions**

NoonVPN Services are available to you upon registration on the Site. By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (“**Subscriber**”) for the period you have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site. NoonVPN reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.

When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term. By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription. The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected. If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may sign in to the Site and turn off auto-renewal. By default, auto-renewal is turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or Paypal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as Bitcoin).

Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use on five (5) different devices at any given time. If you want to use the Services on more than five devices at a time, then you can either (i) use NoonVPN on your router, (ii) purchase additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the “volume licensing” option. For more information on “volume licensing” program, please contact Support.

**Refund Policy**

You may cancel your account with a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase (“**Money Back Guarantee**”).

Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of NoonVPN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact NoonVPN to resolve the issue. In this case, NoonVPN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.

Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or Bitcoin.

Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the Money Back Guarantee option. To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send an email with your request to the following email address: **support@Noonvpn.com**

Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store (iTunes) do not have access to the NoonVPN 30-day money-back guarantee. Instead, users can request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple Support.

**Technical information**

* Statistical server load information. We monitor server performance (CPU, RAM, Server’s net usage) to recommend the most suitable servers to our customers.
* Username and a timestamp of the last session status. This information is used to limit the amount of concurrent active user sessions and is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after a session is terminated.
* Connectivity information. To prevent abuse and to be able to dispute unfair chargebacks, we register whether the user has used the Service in the last 30 days. No personally identifiable information is collected in this case, apart from the fact that the Service was or was not used during the mentioned period.

**Information collected on our applications**

* Application diagnostics. This aggregated and anonymized data helps us to identify problems related to our app performance and updates. The collected information includes crash error reports. This information is general and not specific in any manner and reported by Google Firebase.
* Device information. This is reported by Google Play console and is not specific to any user.
* Device identifiers. In some cases, we may record your mobile device’s identifier for analytics purposes. These identifiers are assigned to your device by the OS manufacturer and can be reset at any time from your device’s settings. This information is ascertained by the Google services.

**Sharing your personal data**

We do not share your personal information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Service providers.**

 We use third-party service providers to help us with various operations, such as payment processing, email automation, website and app diagnostics, analytics and other. As a result, some of these providers may process personal information.

Some of our main long-term service providers:

* Application analytics and diagnostics – Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics (provided by Google);

Requests for data. Any request for user data should follow an appropriate official legal process to be recognized by the laws of the United Kingdom (e.g., mutual legal assistance treaty, letters rogatory). We carefully review each request to make sure it satisfies laws applicable to our company, laws of requesting country, international norms and our internal policies. Being based in United Kingdom allows us to keep no logs of users’ online activity (no IP addresses, browsing data, traffic information, etc.). This means that we are unable to link an individual user to a specific IP address, connection timestamp or other information that we do not collect. Therefore, even in cases we receive a rightfully served request, it might be impossible for us to identify a specific person or provide any identifying information related to that person. In cases where, following an appropriate legal process, we are able to identify a specific person, we will provide the limited data we process as per our Privacy Policy.
