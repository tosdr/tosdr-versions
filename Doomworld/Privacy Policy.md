Privacy Policy
==============

### PRIVACY POLICY

Doomworld is committed to providing a fun, safe and secure website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online.

To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at Doomworld.

As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected.

#### I. The Information We Collect

At Doomworld, we do not collect personally identifiable information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. For some activities, such as online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or a favorite cartoon or character. For some other activities, we may ask visitors to provide an e-mail address.

We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from children under thirteen without notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their child's e-mail address from the applicable database for that activity. We do not knowingly collect the mailing address of a child under thirteen without obtaining verifiable consent from that child's parent. It is up to the child under thirteen to notify Doomworld of his or her age before submitting any information to the website.

When visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, Comcast).

#### II. How We Use the Information

We use visitors' personal information for internal purposes only. We use parents' e-mail addresses to notify them when we have received personal information such as e-mail addresses from their children and to give parents the option to remove their child's name from our lists.

We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties. We sometimes use non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site, and to improve our visitors' experience on Doomworld. We also may aggregate this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.

We will disclose information we maintain as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.

We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.

#### III. Cookies

Doomworld uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place on visitors' computers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of this web site to personal information that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address, we do not use cookies for this purpose. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site.

#### IV. Security

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.
