2. When we collect Personal Information directly from you, a Collection Notice may be provided which will set out:
    
    1. the purposes for collecting the information;
    
    2. any authorising law or court order that requires the collection; and
    
    3. if applicable, the details of any third party to whom your Personal Information is intended to be provided.
    

How will my personal information be used and disclosed?

1. The University will only use and disclose your Personal Information as authorised under the privacy regulatory framework.

2. The University “uses” your Personal Information if it:
    
    1. manipulates, searches or otherwise deals with the information;
    
    2. takes your information into account in the making of a decision; or
    
    3. transfers your information from one department of the University that has particular functions to another department of the University that has different functions. (s.23(3) IPAct)
    

3. The University will only use your Personal Information for the purpose that it was collected (or a directly related purpose) unless you expressly or impliedly agree to the use of the information for another purpose, or the use is otherwise permitted under the IP Act.

4. “Disclosure” of your Personal Information by the University to a third party occurs where:
    
    1. the third party does not already know the Personal Information, and is not in a position to be able to find it out;
    
    2. the University gives the third party your Personal Information, or places it in a position to be able to find it out; and
    
    3. the University ceases to have control over the third party in relation to who will know the Personal Information in the future. (s23(2) IP Act)
    

5. We will not disclose your Personal Information unless it is authorised under the statutory framework, such as where:
    
    1. you have consented to disclosure (whether express or implied);
    
    2. you are reasonably likely to have been aware that it is the University’s usual practice to disclose that type of Personal Information to a relevant entity;
    
    3. disclosure is compelled or authorised by law (for example, a court order or subpoena, or a statutory obligation to disclose);
    4. disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to a person’s life, health, safety, or welfare, or to public health, safety or welfare; or
    
    5. where disclosure is necessary for investigation or enforcement of criminal matters or other law enforcement matters.
    

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

How is my Personal Information stored and secured?

The University takes steps to protect your Personal Information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We use physical, administrative, and technical measures in accordance with our Information Security Policy to safeguard your Personal Information as follows:

1. Personal Information held by us is often stored in our digital systems (hosted on and off-site), including student management information systems, HR management systems, Customer and Relationship Management (CRM) systems, finance systems, library systems and records management systems;

2. The University implements a range of measures and controls to ensure that your Personal Information is kept secure including swipe card access, system access controls, file level security and multifactor digital authentication;

3. Personal Information will be retained as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including to satisfy any legal, contractual, accounting, or reporting requirements;

4. Personal Information is retained and disposed of according to the provisions of the relevant records disposal authority approved by the Queensland State Archives and the University Sector Retention and Disposal Schedule under the Public Records Act 2002 (Qld )

Will my Personal Information be disclosed overseas?

In certain circumstances, the University may transfer your Personal Information outside of Australia (for example when the information is stored in the cloud by an overseas provider or if the University needs to send enrolment information to a partner University regarding an international exchange student).

1. Before your information is disclosed to an overseas recipient, the University will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient will deal with Personal Information in a way that complies with the privacy regulatory framework.

2. Given the wide-ranging activities of the University, it is not practical to list every circumstance or country where Personal Information may be transferred overseas. However, we note that:
    
    1. The University uses a number of cloud-based service systems which require backup/emergency services to be undertaken overseas;
    
    2. As part of our international programs, Personal Information may be sent to partner Universities or other organisations where students undertake international Work Integrated Learning. We may also send information to international recipients as part of our alumni and advancement services engaged with individuals who are overseas.
    

We refer specifically to disclosures of Personal Information of persons in the EEA under the GDPR above.

Exercising your Rights
----------------------

How do I access and amend my personal information?

The University is committed to providing you with straightforward procedures to access and amend to your Personal Information.

1. You can:
    
    1. request access to the Personal Information that we hold about you; or
    
    2. request an amendment to your Personal Information if you believe the information is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, or misleading.
    

2. All requests should be directed to the University’s Privacy Officer—refer to the “Privacy Contacts” section of this Statement.

3. We may refuse access to your Personal Information if:
    
    1. the University is authorised or required under an access law to refuse to give the access; or
    
    2. the document is expressly excluded from the operation of an access law.
    

4. If a request for your Personal Information is denied by the University, you can request an internal review, or seek external review by the Office of the Information Commissioner (OIC). See “Privacy Contacts” below for information on how to contact them.

How do I make a privacy complaint?

We take privacy complaints seriously.

1. If you believe your Personal Information has not been dealt with in accordance with the University Privacy Statement or relevant laws, you may make a complaint in writing to the University’s Privacy Officer.

2. If you do not agree with the decision of the Privacy Officer, you can request an internal review.

Can I stay anonymous or use a pseudonym?

Only in limited circumstances. If you are a student or staff member, it is generally not possible for us to give you the option of anonymity or of using a pseudonym when dealing with us. The nature of our dealings with you and the Personal Information that we collect in order to properly carry out our functions will ordinarily require that it not be anonymous.

However, in limited circumstances it may be possible for a person to remain anonymous when making an enquiry or complaint with the University, for example, if you are a whistleblower under the Public Interest Disclosure Policy.

The University will only collect, use and disclose your Personal Information for a lawful purpose related to a function or activity of the University or as otherwise legally authorised under the privacy regulatory framework.

Key Privacy Legislation
-----------------------

The University has legal obligations to protect the personal information it collects from students, staff and members of the public. These obligations arise principally from the _Information Privacy Act_ 2009 ( Qld ) which establishes safeguards for how Queensland public sector agencies must deal with an individual’s Personal Information. There are also instances where personal information may be covered by the _Commonwealth Privacy Act_ 1988 (Cth).

Where individuals are based in other countries, such as the European Union or the Republic of China, they may also be covered by the privacy laws of those jurisdictions such as the EU_General Data Protection Regulation_ or the China Personal Information Protection Law if their personal information is collected overseas.
