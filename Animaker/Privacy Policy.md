For sake of clarification, “you” or “your” generally refers to the Authorized User. If you are using the Services by invitation of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer sets its own policies regarding storage, processing, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Customer Data, which may affect your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings it has in place.
