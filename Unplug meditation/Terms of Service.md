**Unplug.com and Unplug: Meditation App Terms of Use** 

These Terms of Use are a legally binding contract between you and Unplug Meditation LLC (“Unplug,” “we,” or “us”) regarding your use of Unplug’s suite of online services and mobile and web applications, including without limitation www.unplug.com and the Unplug: Guided Meditation App (the “Service”).

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE UNPLUG PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THE “TERMS”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.

These Terms provide that all disputes between you and Unplug with respect to your use of the Service will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Please review Section 26 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration”) for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with Unplug.

1. **The Service Overview.** The Service is intended to provide you with information about Unplug and its products and services and provide you access to Unplug’s guided meditation videos. You understand and agree that the Service is intended to be used while in a safe place. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you assume all risk and Unplug is not responsible for any harm to you or others that may occur from your use of the Service. You may not access or use the Service for any other purpose. You are solely responsible for any information, images, videos, or other content or materials you upload to or transmit through the Service (“Communications Data”).
    
2. **Eligibility.** You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are an individual who is at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and (d) you have read and agree to our Privacy Policy, as further described in Section 15 below. If you are under the age of 18 and not an emancipated minor or its equivalent under applicable law, then you represent and warrant that you have obtained the consent of your parent or legal guardian to use the Service. In these Terms of Use, “you” shall mean the person using the App and the Organization on whose behalf the person is using the App.
    
3. **Accounts and Registration.** To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address and password. You agree that the profile information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. You understand and agree that as part of the registration process we may use this information to verify your eligibility to use the Service. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at support@unplug.com.
    
4. **Payment and Subscription Services.** When you purchase services from Unplug, you authorize Unplug to charge all sums as described in these Terms, for the services you select, to that payment method. When you become a member in one of our paid subscription services, you understand that it is a membership that automatically renews itself every month or year indefinitely without action. Depending on your membership choice, Unplug’s payment processor will charge the then-current monthly, yearly or lifetime membership fee (plus sales tax, if applicable) to the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. Before you enroll in the subscription services, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are non-refundable, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to 24 hours or such longer period as necessary to process the update/cancellation with Apple or Google for the update or cancellation to take effect. If Unplug changes the fees for the Service, including by adding additional fees or charges, Unplug will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, Unplug may discontinue providing the Service to you. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Unplug may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. If your payment is not successful, the benefits of your membership will be suspended until payment is received, provided payment is received within approximately 10 business days. If payment is not received within 10 business days, your membership will be cancelled. You may cancel your subscription at any time as follows:
    
    * **If you signed up for Unplug through your Apple iTunes account,** you may cancel at any time by going to your “Apple Subscriptions” settings, choosing “Manage Subscription”, and cancelling or changing your subscription details.
        
    * **If you signed up for Unplug through your Google Play account,** you may cancel at any time by going to your “Google Play Subscriptions” settings, choosing “Manage Subscription”, and cancelling or changing your subscription details.
        
    * **If you signed up for Unplug through the Unplug website or mobile site,** you may cancel at any time by signing in to your account at www.unplug.app and cancelling your membership under the “My Account” tab.
        
    * If you have any questions about updating or cancelling your Unplug account, please contact us at (310) 826-8899 or by email at [support@unplug.com](mailto:support@unplug.com).
        
5. **Trial Subscriptions.** We may offer trial subscriptions at the beginning of paid services and subscriptions. The terms of any trial subscription are specific only to the product(s) subject to the trial subscription. Under certain subscriptions and with your prior consent, at the end of the trial period, you may be automatically billed on a recurring basis for the service on a going-forward basis. For such subscriptions, we will not bill your debit or credit card until the relevant trial period is completed and you have not cancelled your subscription during such trial period as provided below. An authorization will be requested from your billing account to make sure it is valid and in good standing. You may cancel your subscription at any time during the trial period without charge. To cancel your subscription, please following the cancellation process described above in Section 4 based on how you signed up for Unplug. If you wish to continue your subscription, do nothing and your subscription will automatically continue without interruption, as long as you have a valid payment method associated with your account. Based on your membership choice, the monthly or yearly fee (plus sales tax, if applicable) will be charged at the conclusion of the trial period to the debit or credit card you designated as your preference.
    
6. **Licenses**
    
    a. **Limited License.** Subject to your ongoing compliance with these Terms, Unplug grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to (i) install the mobile application(s) associated with the Service, and use such mobile applications so installed, solely in object code format, and solely for your personal, non-commercial use for lawful purposes, on devices that you own or control, and (ii) access and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use for lawful purposes.

These calls and messages may be for informational purposes, such as to provide you with the information or consultation you requested. Standard text messaging and telephone minute charges applied by your cell phone carrier will apply.  
      
    Unplug may, without further notice or warning and in our discretion, monitor and/or record calls and text message-based communications for our business purposes, such as quality assurance and training purposes and to protect our rights and the rights of others, and you hereby consent to such monitoring and recording.

IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF SMS and MMS TEXTS FROM US, YOU MAY REPLY “STOP” FROM THE MOBILE DEVICE RECEIVING THE MESSAGES.

We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 2, 5, and 8 through 29, along with the Unplug Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.

26\. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

a. **Generally.** In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Unplug in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Unplug agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND UNPLUG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

b. **Exceptions.** Despite the provisions of Section 26(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

c. **Arbitrator.** To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between you and Unplug will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Unplug.

d. **Notice; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Unplug’s address for Notice is: Unplug Meditation, LLC, Attention: Legal Department, 12401 Wilshire Blvd. #101, Los Angeles, CA 90025. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Unplug may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Unplug must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

e. **Fees.** If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Unplug will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Unplug for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

f. **No Class Actions.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND UNPLUG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Unplug agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

g. **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.** If Unplug makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Unplug’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Unplug’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Unplug will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

h. **Opt-Out Procedure.** You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“**Opt-Out Notice**”) in accordance with the terms of this Section. For new users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you use the Service for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Unplug Meditation, LLC, Attention: Legal Department, 12401 Wilshire Blvd. #101, Los Angeles, CA 90025. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the arbitration agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the (s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the arbitration agreement. If you opt out of the arbitration agreement, Unplug will likewise not be bound by these arbitration provisions. All other terms of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of the arbitration agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. Unplug users who accepted a previous version of these Terms that included an arbitration agreement, and who did not timely opt out of that arbitration agreement, remain bound by the last arbitration agreement that they accepted. Upon receipt of a valid Opt-Out Notice, Unplug will provide the opting out user with a copy of the arbitration agreement from the last version of the Terms that the user accepted, if any exists.

i. **Enforceability.** If Section 26(f) is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 26 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 26 (except this Section 26(i)) will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

27\. **Claims.** To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to these Terms shall be brought by you more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action. This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties. All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.

28\. **Consent to Electronic Communications.** By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. By providing your mobile number to us, you consent to receiving text messages at that number for account verification, notifications, and other purposes related to the Service. In addition to any fees Unplug may charge for use of text or multimedia messaging with the Service, your carrier may charge standard messaging, data, and other fees, and you are responsible for those charges. We may send and receive text messages through cellular telephone operators or other networks, and the level of reliability may vary. We are not responsible for the timeliness or final delivery of text messages, as that is outside our control and is the responsibility of the cellular telephone operator or other networks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will use your mobile number in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

29\. **Export.** You may not use the Service if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using the Services. You must comply with all U.S. or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software, technology, and services.

31\. **Consumer Protection Notice.** Please note that, if you are a consumer, the limitations in these Terms are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the laws of your state of residence.

a. **California.**  If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

32.  **Notice Regarding Apple.** This Section 32 only applies to the extent you are using our mobile application(s) on an iOS device. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Unplug only, not with Apple Inc. (“Apple”), and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. In the event of any failure of the Service to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the Service infringe third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third party terms when using the Service. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary of these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant that (x) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (y) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
