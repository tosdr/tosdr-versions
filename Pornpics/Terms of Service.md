        4. **Billing Disputes**
            
            If you believe that the Company has charged you in error, you must notify the Company in writing no later than 30 days after you receive the billing statement in which the error first appeared. If you fail to notify the Company in writing of a dispute within this 30-day deadline, you waive any disputed charges. You must submit any billing disputes in writing to [https://www.pornpics.com/contact/](https://www.pornpics.com/contact/) and include a detailed statement describing the nature and amount of the disputed charges.

        6. **Refunds**

The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate the Company to provide refunds in the future, under any circumstance.
            
        7. **Cancellation**
            
            You may cancel your premium membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Website through the end of your membership term.

18. 18\. **Indemnification**
    1. 18.1 **In General**
        
        You will pay the Company, its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, content providers, and service providers (the "**_Indemnified Parties_**") for any loss of the Indemnified Parties' that is caused by any of the following:
        
        1. your actual or alleged access of or conduct on the Website, including your submissions to the Website;
        2. your breach of this agreement;
        3. your actual or alleged violation of rights of any person, including intellectual property, publicity, and privacy rights;
        4. your actual or alleged violation of any applicable law;
        5. your actual or alleged tortious conduct; or
        6. your actual or alleged criminal conduct.
        
        But you are not required to pay if the loss was caused by the Indemnified Parties’ actual intentional misconduct.
        
    2. 18.2 **Definitions**
        1. "**_Loss_**" means an amount that the Indemnified Parties are legally responsible for or pay in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can be tangible or intangible; can arise from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory of recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages.
        2. A loss is "**_caused by_**" an event if the loss would not have happened without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.
    3. 18.3 **Indemnified Parties’ Duty to Notify You**
        
        If the Indemnified Party has your contact information, the Indemnified Party will notify you before the 30th day after the Indemnified Party knows or should reasonably have known of a claim for a loss that you might be compelled to pay. But the Indemnified Party’s failure to give you timely notice does not end your obligation, except if that failure prejudices your ability to defend or mitigate losses.
        
    4. 18.4 **Legal Defense of a Claim**
        
        The Indemnified Party has control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it), unless the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense. If the Indemnified Party directs you to control the defense, you will not settle any litigation without the Indemnified Party’s written consent if the settlement (1) imposes a penalty or limitation on the Indemnified Party, (2) admits the Indemnified Party’s fault, or (3) does not fully release the Indemnified Party from liability. You and the Indemnified Party will cooperate with each other in good faith on a claim.
        
    5. 18.5 **No Exclusivity**
        
        The Indemnified Parties’ rights under this section 18 do not affect other rights they might have.
        
19. 19\. **Governing Law; Place for Resolving Disputes**
    1. 19.1 British Virgin Island law, without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles, governs all matters arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement. The predominant purpose of this agreement is providing services and licensing access to intellectual property and not a “sale of goods.” This agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.
        
    2. 19.2 Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of competent jurisdiction located in the British Virgin Islands. Each party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of competent jurisdiction located in the British Virgin Islands to resolve all disputes not subject to arbitration. Each party hereby waives any right to seek another forum or venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.
        
    3. 19.3 For purposes of this section 19, the Website will be deemed solely based in the British Virgin Islands and will be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over the Company, either specific or general, in any other jurisdiction.
        
20. 20\. **Dispute Resolution**
    1. 20.1 **Litigation Election**

    2. 20.2 **Negotiation**
        
        Each party will allow the other a reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met the duties under this agreement. The parties will first meet and negotiate with each other in good faith to try to resolve all disputes between the parties arising out of or relating to the Website.
        
    3. 20.3 **Mediation**
        
        If the parties cannot settle a dispute arising out of or relating to the Website or this agreement through negotiation after 30 days, either party may, by notice to the other party and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), demand mediation under the ICC Mediation Rules. Mediation will take place in Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. The language of the mediation will be English. Each party will bear its own costs in mediation, and the parties will share equally between them all third-party mediation costs unless the parties agree differently in writing. Each party will participate actively and constructively in mediation proceedings once started and will attend at least one joint meeting between the mediator and the parties. Any party may terminate mediation at any time after an initial meeting between the mediator and the parties.
        
    4. 20.4 **Arbitration**
        1. **Procedure**
            
            If the parties cannot settle a dispute through mediation, the parties will settle any unresolved dispute arising out of or relating to the Site or this agreement by binding arbitration administered by the ICC in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including any claim that any part of this agreement is void or voidable.
            
        2. **Location**
            
            Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place in Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands.
            
        3. **Fees**
            
            Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
            
        4. **Award**
            
            The arbitrator may grant whatever relief that would be available in a court at law or in equity, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or exemplary damages, or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this agreement. In accordance with section 20.6, the arbitrator’s award will include costs of arbitration, reasonable legal fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            
        5. **Confidentiality**

    5. 20.5 **Right to Injunctive Relief**

    6. 20.6 **Recovery of Expenses**

    8. 20.8 **Class Action Waiver**
        
        All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless the Company agrees otherwise, the arbitrator will not consolidate more than one person’s claims. Both parties acknowledge that each party is waiving the right to participate in a class action.

        The parties may waive a provision in this agreement only by a writing signed by the party or parties against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy, or in requiring the satisfaction of any condition, under this agreement, and no act, omission, or course of dealing between the parties, operates as a waiver or estoppel of any right, remedy, or condition. A waiver made in writing on one occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver on any future occasion or against any other person.
        
    6. 21.6 **Severability**
        
        The parties intend as follows:
        
        1. that if any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, then that provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, unless that modification is not permitted by law, in which case that provision will be disregarded;
        2. that if modifying or disregarding the unenforceable provision would result in failure of an essential purpose of this agreement, the entire agreement will be held unenforceable;
        3. that if an unenforceable provision is modified or disregarded in accordance with this section 21.6, then the rest of the agreement will remain in effect as written; and
        4. that any unenforceable provision will remain as written in any circumstances other than those in which the provision is held to be unenforceable.
