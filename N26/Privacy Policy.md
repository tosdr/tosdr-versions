like the payment reference and registered IBAN.



During the creation of your N26 account we will need access to your geolocation upon your consent in the

your smartphone. The lawful basis of this processing is our legitimate interests in confirming that you are

prevention (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). For more information on the legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing

Such documents can be a proof of residence (such as a gas, water or electricity bill less than 3 months old or a

registration certificate), a proof of salary (such as an employment contract, salary statement or statement of

assets and income; in case you send us one of the two latter ones, we ask you to please black out any data

Customer to join as owner of a Joint Account set up by that Customer.

In order to let other N26 Customers find you (so they can invite you), or to let them know that you have joined

N26 and are ready to join a Joint Account, you have to make yourself “visible” and allow access to your contact

list. Notwithstanding, you can still invite other members even if you are not visible. You can find more

personal data and transactions related to that Joint Account, including transactions made by the other member

on the Joint Account. There will be no access from the other account holder to your data related to your other

existing N26 account(s).



The processing of data in the context of creating and using a Joint Account is necessary for the execution of the

agreement between N26 and you and the other account holder (Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR), and also for the purposes of

share these datasets with third parties. This processing is based on N26’s legal obligations, in accordance with

Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR, or based on N26’s legitimate interest, under Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. For more information on the

legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing data, please see section II. above.



The following example gives you an idea how we are using anonymised data sets under our legal obligations:

The Deposit Protection Scheme of German Banks (Entschädigungsfonds deutscher Banken ‘EdB’) requires us to

provide anonymised datasets that allows EdB to be updated on indemnifiable deposits for the purposes of the

Deposit Guarantee Act (Einlagensicherungsgesetz).

24\. Data processing when using the iDEAL Payment Scheme

iDEAL is a payment method that you can use to make online payments through your N26 App or Web App, for

example in an online store or by scanning a QR code. It facilitates a direct transfer from your N26 account to

that of a beneficiary (e.g. a merchant). The iDEAL scheme is operated by Currence iDEAL B.V., located at Gustav

Mahlerplein 33, 1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands (“Currence”), which provides the infrastructure and

technical setup for the connection between the online payment environment and your N26 account.



When you initiate an iDEAL payment using your N26 account, we process your name, customer ID and data

related to the N26 account that you select to use with iDEAL, namely IBAN, BIC, status, account ID and balance.

We also process data related to the iDEAL transaction, which include amount, breakdown, type of transaction

(i.e. online, in-store, customer-to-customer or QR), currency, transaction ID (a number used to identify an iDEAL

transaction executed by you), reference ID (a number used to identify the transaction authorisation request),

status and period of validity (maximum authorisation time for an iDEAL payment request), a unique code to

confirm that you have been recognised and authenticated when connecting to your N26 account, as well as the

name and ID of the iDEAL payment beneficiary (e.g. a merchant), their bank ID, IBAN and BIC and the merchant

category code (if applicable). We further process data related to the device and browser that you used to make

the iDEAL transaction, namely IP address, http referer, language settings, device ID, browser ID and device

fingerprint.



We process this data as a controller to verify your identity, authenticate you as an N26 customer and to enable

your iDEAL payment, based on the execution of our agreement with you as per Art. 6 (1) b GDPR. In this

context, we collaborate with Currence, which acts as a data processor on our behalf. Currence also processes

your data as a separate controller for their own purposes. You can find more information about the processing

of your data by Currence in the iDeal Privacy \& Cookies Statement.



In case you create an iDEAL profile in connection with your N26 account, N26 and Currence act as joint

controllers for the purpose of enabling your iDEAL profile. An iDEAL profile allows for faster iDEAL payments

and checkouts by allowing you to store relevant information within the iDEAL scheme. To verify your identity as

well as to register and manage the iDEAL profile, we jointly process your name, address, phone number, email

address, the masked IBAN of your selected N26 account (only the first 8 and last 4 characters), a unique iDEAL

profile identifier and the timestamp of your iDEAL profile registration. This is done to execute our agreement

with you as per Art. 6 (1) b GDPR.



We further process your data to detect and prevent fraud and criminal acts, including money laundering and

terrorism financing, as well as to manage risks and for reporting purposes, based on our legitimate interests

under Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. For more information on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing data, please

see section II. above. In addition, we process your data to comply with our legal obligations stemming from

applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including anti-money laundering and tax laws as well as other

binding measures related to financial matters, based on Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR.

Android, Web), app language version (e.g. EN, DE, IT, ES), app version, T\&C country, membership tier and time

intervals since passing the KYC process.



Additionally, we combine your ideas with data that we process in the context of our contractual relationship

with you, including your app operating system, date of account creation (limited to month and year), app

version and country of residence. We will not link your ideas to any direct identifiers, such as your customer ID,

and the feedback you provide will not have any influence on our actions towards you. We merely link the data

to your idea to better understand the context of your ideas, e.g. if it is something that is specifically interesting

for a specific market or if the idea is linked to a specific usage period of our app. We process your data, as

described, for research purposes to improve our products, processes and service levels, based on our

legitimate interests, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR.

IV. Identification by means of a liveness-detection photo and

video-ident procedure

N26 is legally obliged to check your identity using a valid identification document within the framework of

opening an account and to store specific information from the identification document. For this purpose, we

offer you a liveness-detection photo (with the combination of photo and video), via an encrypted transmission

path, through our reliance partner Safened-Fourthline.

N26 will transmit personal data to its external service providers, as data processors, for the purpose of verifying

your identity as required by law. Regarding the liveness-detection photo performed by Safened-Fourthline, we

access the camera of your end device and a photograph of you will be taken by yourself, as well as a video in

which you will be requested to move, and the front and rear sides of your personal identification document or

the principal page of your passport.

obligations and based on Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR. In order to verify your identity by means of the photo and videos

communication with our customers, we can only offer a remote check of your identity and thus need your

When you reach out to us regarding any contractual matters related to an account (such as account opening,

account or transaction related information), the lawful basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR.

Otherwise the lawful basis for the data processing is our legitimate interest, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f)

GDPR. Such data processing serves our legitimate interest in allowing us to communicate with you upon your

Online advertising helps us promote our products and services on the internet. In this context, we process

personal data about your use of N26 services to deliver personalised advertisements to you and other internet

users online and to measure and optimise their performance. We only process personal data for online

advertising purposes if you consent to such processing, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR and Section 25 (1)

Personal Details \> “Advertising Partners” (disable toggle). The data processing for online advertising purposes is

described in more detail further down in each section.



1\. Custom and lookalike audiences

We process your data to create so-called custom and lookalike audiences. Custom audiences consist of N26

customers and internet users and are created to display personalised content to both groups. This permits us

to exclude N26 customers from the delivery of advertisements that we believe are not relevant to them.

Lookalike audiences consist of internet users that share certain characteristics with N26 customers, which

enables us to define target groups that are more similar to N26 customers than the average internet user and

deliver more relevant advertisements to them.

To create custom and lookalike audiences, we use the services of our Advertising Partners below:

● Google Ireland Ltd, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, Ireland (“Google”);

● Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Meta").

For the purposes described above, we transfer your pseudonymised email address to Google and Meta. They

then match this email address against a potential account you might have on their services. For this purpose,

and regardless of whether the matching is successful or not, the data is retained by Google for up to 48 hours

and by Meta for up to 8 hours, after which it is deleted. Google and Meta do not share these data with third

parties. You can find further information on how these technologies work under How Google uses Customer

Match data and in the terms of Facebook Custom Audiences.



2\. Conversion tracking

We process your data to capture specific actions that take place inside the N26 App and Web App, specifically

the sign-up, acceptance of T\&Cs, identification procedure of new customers and completion of a first

transaction (so-called “conversions”). This enables us to measure and optimise the performance of our online

advertisements and to deliver them to internet users that we infer are more likely to complete these

conversions.

For the purposes described above, we use the services of Google and Meta (as identified in the previous

section). We transfer conversion data, including date and time, to Google and Meta together with the following

personal data, which is transmitted with encryption: email address, first name, last name, phone number,

gender, city, zip code and country of residence, IP address, customer ID and predicted customer lifetime value.

These data points are associated with other personal data collected on our website (see the section on

Personalisation/Targeting Cookies in our Cookie Policies for N26 websites). Google and Meta are able to

associate these data with your account on their services, if existent. The data is deleted by Google after a

maximum of 18 months and by Meta after a maximum of 2 years.



VIII. International transfers of personal data

Insofar as N26 transmits data to entities located outside the European Economic Area and in order to ensure an

appropriate level of data protection equivalent to that granted under the GDPR upon the international transfers

of personal data, N26 has implemented one or more of the following transfer mechanisms, in addition to

safeguards in accordance with the international data transfer impact assessment on the respective data

transfer, if applicable:

● A decision of the European Commission deciding that the third country ensures an adequate level of

protection, pursuant to Art. 45 (1) GDPR - the existing adequacy decisions can be found here. This

includes the certification under the Data Privacy Framework Program developed by the U.S.

Department of Commerce and the European Commission - self certified entities can be found here;

● Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) approved as per Art. 47 GDPR, pursuant to Art. 46 (2) b) GDPR;

● Standard data protection clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries (“SCCs”), as

adopted by the European Commission, pursuant to Art. 46 (2) c) GDPR - the most recent version of the

IX. Data collected in the framework of phone call recordings

When discussing any contractual matters (such as account related information or your transactions) with us on

the phone, the call between us will be recorded for security and evidence reasons. Our interest to be able to

prove contractual inquiries as well as to prevent and detect fraudulent behavior stipulates our legitimate

interest to record calls in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. This does not apply to calls aimed at clarifying

general inquiries related to N26 products and services.



The call recordings will be retained as long as required for security and evidentiary purposes. The call

recordings will be processed by our Interactive Voice Response (IVR) service provider who is processing

personal data on behalf of N26 (Art. 28 GDPR). If we are required to do so, the recordings will be shared with

the competent authorities, in accordance with the applicable law.



If you do not wish to be recorded when calling us, please do contact us by email or through our Customer Chat

for queries related to account related information or your transactions.

● right to restriction of the processing according to Art. 18 GDPR, which means you can request the

restriction of the processing of your personal data when it is legally permitted and, in particular, (i)

Without prejudice to section X.2. below, please:



Exercise your right of access, right to erasure and right to object to the processing through our webform;



Please do not address your requests through a third party platform which requires us to get back to you

through that same means, since we are not able to clearly identify you as an N26 customer in such cases.

Instead, please resort to the aforementioned ways of making use of your rights before N26.

● Right to revoke your consent (in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR)

XI. Deletion and retention periods



We are storing and processing your personal data only as long as it is necessary to perform our obligations

under the agreement with you or as long as the law requires us to store it. That means, if the data is not

required anymore for statutory or contractual obligations, your data will be deleted. This also occurs in case

your onboarding process is not finalized with the opening of an account, and meanwhile there are still pending

legal or security obligations for the bank to preserve your data. However, that rule does not apply, if its limited

processing is necessary for the following purposes:



● Performing regulatory and tax retention periods, which relate to the applicable laws and

complementary regulation, including the following laws: Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch), Tax

Code (Abgabenordnung), Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz), Money-laundering Act (Geldwäschegesetz) and

Security Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz). The statutory retention periods and documentation

obligations are between two to ten years. The applicable legal basis is Art. 17 (3) b) GDPR together with

Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR.

● Keeping evidence in the context of statutory limitation periods. According to German Civil law

(Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch) these limitation periods can be up to thirty years, however the regular

limitation period is three years. The applicable legal basis for this is Art. 17 (3) e) GDPR together with

Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR.



Furthermore, whenever your consent is the legal ground to process your personal data, N26 will store that data

for as long as you do not revoke your consent or until your account is closed, whatever happens the latest.
