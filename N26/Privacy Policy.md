Please note that it is not possible to open an account, if you do not provide your personal data as mentioned

In order to process transactions, N26 receives personal data and transfers personal data according to the

applicable legal and regulatory framework to payers, recipients and other financial institutions. The personal

data received by other entities in this regard concerns your name and surname, including transaction details

like the payment reference and registered IBAN.



During the creation of your N26 account we will need access to your geolocation upon your consent in the

settings of your smartphone; you will find further information in the privacy policy of the operating system of

your smartphone. The lawful basis of this processing is our legitimate interests in confirming that you are

located in your country of residence in order for us to comply with our legal obligations related to fraud

prevention (Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR). For more information on the legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing

data, please see section II. above.

What personal data we will be processing depends on the document we are requesting and receiving from you.

Such documents can be a proof of residence (such as a gas, water or electricity bill less than 3 months old or a

registration certificate), a proof of salary (such as an employment contract, salary statement or statement of

assets and income; in case you send us one of the two latter ones, we ask you to please black out any data

related to your religious beliefs and family status, if provided therein), your visa documentation or proof of

study which states the reason why you live in the country indicated by you as country of residence, or a

In case the information you sent us upon our request is not sufficient, we will reach out to you and ask you for

more documentation, which is equally subject to the above mentioned.



2. Data collection and processing in case of opening and using a N26 Joint

Account

In order to facilitate Joint Accounts we have to process the personal data mentioned in the preceding Section

(Sec. III. 1). Additionally:

To start managing your money together with another N26 Customer, you can either set up a Joint Account and

invite another N26 Customer to join you or, alternatively, you can accept an invitation from another N26

Customer to join as owner of a Joint Account set up by that Customer.

In order to let other N26 Customers find you (so they can invite you), or to let them know that you have joined

N26 and are ready to join a Joint Account, you have to make yourself “visible” and allow access to your contact

list. Notwithstanding, you can still invite other members even if you are not visible. You can find more

information on this in Sec. III. 3 and 4, below.

Should you be the one creating a Joint Account, please note that when you invite another customer to join a

Joint Account, your contact details will be shared with the invitee, as an additional security step, for the purpose

of fraud prevention.



● When you own the account together with another N26 Customer:

Both account holders are equal owners of the account and both are entitled to have individual access to all

personal data and transactions related to that Joint Account, including transactions made by the other member

on the Joint Account. There will be no access from the other account holder to your data related to your other

existing N26 account(s).



The processing of data in the context of creating and using a Joint Account is necessary for the execution of the

agreement between N26 and you and the other account holder (Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR), and also for the purposes of

Mahlerplein 33, 1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands (“Currence”), which provides the infrastructure and

related to the N26 account that you select to use with iDEAL, namely IBAN, BIC, status, account ID and balance.

We also process data related to the iDEAL transaction, which include amount, breakdown, type of transaction

transaction executed by you), reference ID (a number used to identify the transaction authorisation request),

category code (if applicable). We further process data related to the device and browser that you used to make

the iDEAL transaction, namely IP address, http referer, language settings, device ID, browser ID and device

fingerprint.



We process this data as a controller to verify your identity, authenticate you as an N26 customer and to enable

your iDEAL payment, based on the execution of our agreement with you as per Art. 6 (1) b GDPR. In this

context, we collaborate with Currence, which acts as a data processor on our behalf. Currence also processes

your data as a separate controller for their own purposes. You can find more information about the processing

of your data by Currence in the iDeal Privacy \& Cookies Statement.



In case you create an iDEAL profile in connection with your N26 account, N26 and Currence act as joint

and checkouts by allowing you to store relevant information within the iDEAL scheme. To verify your identity as

well as to register and manage the iDEAL profile, we jointly process your name, address, phone number, email

address, the masked IBAN of your selected N26 account (only the first 8 and last 4 characters), a unique iDEAL

profile identifier and the timestamp of your iDEAL profile registration. This is done to execute our agreement

7. Data processing by N26



If you use our Social Media Pages to contact us (e.g. by creating your own posts on our Social Media Pages or by

tagging us, responding to one of our posts or by sending us private messages) we collect personal data that you

provide to us. We only use such personal data for the purpose of communicating with you in order to provide

the requested information.



When you reach out to us regarding any contractual matters related to an account (such as account opening,

account or transaction related information), the lawful basis for the data processing is Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR.

Otherwise the lawful basis for the data processing is our legitimate interest, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f)

GDPR. Such data processing serves our legitimate interest in allowing us to communicate with you upon your

inquiry and answer your request. For more information on the legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing

data, please see section II. above. We delete stored data when they are no longer necessary for this purpose or

to comply with any applicable statutory requirements.



2\. Social Media Competitions and Giveaways

When entering into competitions or giveaways published on our Social Media Pages, we process certain

personal data related to you required for the administration and organisation of the competition or giveaway

as well as potential announcements of winners. This includes your name, username and the content of the

post(s) that you make in the context of promotion or giveaway, or any other data points provided by you in the

course of your participation. Should you win a prize, we further process your email address to communicate

with you (e.g. to deliver your prize) and your tax ID and address, for tax reporting purposes and we might use

your data to announce you as the winner in our Social Media Pages.



Where you participate and win in a competition or giveaway, the processing of your data is necessary for the

performance of a contract, based on Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. Where we are legally obliged to process your personal

data for tax reporting purposes, the lawful basis for this data processing is the compliance with our legal

obligations, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR. Otherwise the lawful basis for this data processing is our

legitimate interest, based on Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. Such data processing serves our legitimate interest in offering

competitions and giveaways for marketing purposes. For more information on the legitimate interest as a legal

basis for processing data, please see section II. above.



Personal data collected as part of competitions and giveaways are solely processed for the purpose of selecting

the winners and will be deleted within 4 weeks after the end of the competition or giveaway period. This does

not apply with regards to winners. In that case, we delete stored data when they are no longer necessary for

this purpose or to comply with any applicable statutory requirements.



VIII. International transfers of personal data

Insofar as N26 transmits data to entities located outside the European Economic Area and in order to ensure an

appropriate level of data protection equivalent to that granted under the GDPR upon the international transfers

of personal data, N26 has implemented one or more of the following transfer mechanisms, in addition to

safeguards in accordance with the international data transfer impact assessment on the respective data

transfer, if applicable:

● A decision of the European Commission deciding that the third country ensures an adequate level of

protection, pursuant to Art. 45 (1) GDPR - the existing adequacy decisions can be found here (this

includes commercial organisations participating in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework);

● Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) approved as per Art. 47 GDPR, pursuant to Art. 46 (2) b) GDPR;

● Standard data protection clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries (“SCCs”), as

adopted by the European Commission, pursuant to Art. 46 (2) c) GDPR - the most recent version of the

SCCs can be found here;

● Your explicit consent under Art. 49 (1) a) GDPR, when we transmit data to entities located outside the

European Economic Area and in third countries that don't provide an adequate level of protection of

personal data in the terms of the GDPR and none of the other transfer mechanisms apply.

You can obtain a detailed copy of the transfer mechanism and more information in this regard by sending a

request to N26 to the addresses indicated in section XII. below.



IX. Data collected in the framework of phone call recordings

When discussing any contractual matters (such as account related information or your transactions) with us on

the phone, the call between us will be recorded for security and evidence reasons. Our interest to be able to

prove contractual inquiries as well as to prevent and detect fraudulent behavior stipulates our legitimate

interest to record calls in accordance with Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. This does not apply to calls aimed at clarifying

general inquiries related to N26 products and services.



The call recordings will be retained as long as required for security and evidentiary purposes. The call

recordings will be processed by our Interactive Voice Response (IVR) service provider who is processing

personal data on behalf of N26 (Art. 28 GDPR). If we are required to do so, the recordings will be shared with

the competent authorities, in accordance with the applicable law.



If you do not wish to be recorded when calling us, please do contact us by email or through our Customer Chat

for queries related to account related information or your transactions.



X. Rights



1\. Your rights

You have the following rights concerning your personal data:



● right to revoke your consent according to Art. 7 (3) GDPR, which is detailed in section X.2. below;

● right of access according to Art. 15 GDPR, which means you can request information on whether your

personal data is being processed by N26 and information on the particular processing of personal

data, at any time, along with a copy of the information processed. In no case this right covers the

access to documents or the obtention of copies of such documents;

● right of rectification according to Art. 16 GDPR, which means you can request the rectification of your

data when they are incomplete or inaccurate;

● right to erasure according to Art. 17 GDPR, which means you can request the deletion of your

personal data when they are no longer required by N26 for the purposes they were initially collected

for, or when you understand they have been illicitly used. N26 can reject your request, if the data is

necessary to comply with a legal obligation, for public interest reasons or for legal actions;

● right to restriction of the processing according to Art. 18 GDPR, which means you can request the

restriction of the processing of your personal data when it is legally permitted and, in particular, (i)

while you challenge the accuracy of your data, (ii) when you request the restriction of your data

because you believe the processing is unlawful, or (iii) when the data is no longer needed for the

purposes for which it was collected but N26 needs them for legal actions;

● right to object to the processing according to Art. 21 GDPR, which is detailed in section X.2. below;

● right to data portability according Art. 20 GDPR, which means you can request N26 to provide you

personal data, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit your

data to another controller where the data processing is based on the consent, or on a contract and the

processing is carried out by automated means;

● Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority according to Art. 77 GDPR, which means

that you can complain before the supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of your

personal data by N26 infringes the GDPR.



Without prejudice to section X.2. below, please:



Exercise your right of access, right to erasure and right to object to the processing through our webform;



Please do not address your requests through a third party platform which requires us to get back to you

through that same means, since we are not able to clearly identify you as an N26 customer in such cases.

Instead, please resort to the aforementioned ways of making use of your rights before N26.



2\. Specifically, your right to revoke consent and right of objection



You can find below more details about your right to revoke consent and right of objection:



● Right to revoke your consent (in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR)



You have the right to revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time with

effect for the future. In the event you revoke your consent, your personal data is not processed any

longer, unless further processing can be based on a different legal basis for processing (excluding

consent). The processing of your personal data remains justified until the date of your revocation.



You can exercise your right to revoke your consent via the specific means provided in our Web App or

App, if applicable.



● Right of objection (in accordance with Art. 21 (1) GDPR)



You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, which is processed in accordance

with Art. 6 (1) e) and Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR, at any time. This does also include profiling according to Art. 4

(4) GDPR. In case you object, your personal data is not processed any longer, except when we have

legitimate reasons to continue the processing, which exceed your interests, rights and liberties or

when the processing is necessary to enforce, exercise or defend legal claims. The processing of your

personal data remains justified until the date of your objection. You can exercise your right of objection

through our webform.



● Right of objection concerning data processing for direct marketing purposes (in accordance with

Art. 21 (2) GDPR)



In some cases, we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes. You have the right to object to the

direct marketing purposes, your personal data is not processed any longer for this purpose. The processing of

your personal data remains justified until the date of your objection. You can exercise your right of objection

through our webform.

XI. Deletion and retention periods



We are storing and processing your personal data only as long as it is necessary to perform our obligations

under the agreement with you or as long as the law requires us to store it. That means, if the data is not

required anymore for statutory or contractual obligations, your data will be deleted. This also occurs in case

your onboarding process is not finalized with the opening of an account, and meanwhile there are still pending

legal or security obligations for the bank to preserve your data. However, that rule does not apply, if its limited

processing is necessary for the following purposes:



● Performing regulatory and tax retention periods, which relate to the applicable laws and

complementary regulation, including the following laws: Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch), Tax

Code (Abgabenordnung), Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz), Money-laundering Act (Geldwäschegesetz) and

Security Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz). The statutory retention periods and documentation

obligations are between two to ten years. The applicable legal basis is Art. 17 (3) b) GDPR together with

Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR.

● Keeping evidence in the context of statutory limitation periods. According to German Civil law

(Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch) these limitation periods can be up to thirty years, however the regular

limitation period is three years. The applicable legal basis for this is Art. 17 (3) e) GDPR together with

Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR.



Furthermore, whenever your consent is the legal ground to process your personal data, N26 will store that data

for as long as you do not revoke your consent or until your account is closed, whatever happens the latest.
