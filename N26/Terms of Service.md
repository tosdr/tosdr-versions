1.1 Subject of the business relationship

The following terms and conditions (“Terms”) set out the role and responsibilities of N26 Bank AG,

purchasing insurances in the N26 mobile application and the N26 web application (together “N26 App”).



These Terms explain our responsibilities for offering insurances in the N26 App and facilitating insurance

purchases. We will describe with whom we are working together and what their responsibilities are.



You can purchase insurances directly in the N26 App. The insurance contract is carried out solely by

simplesurance GmbH, Hallesches Ufer 60, 10963 Berlin (“Simplesurance”) and the insurance company as set

out in your insurance certificate (“Insurer”), (together “Insurance Partners”).



N26 as well as Simplesurance act as insurance agents in accordance with Section 34d para. 1 of the Commercial

Code (Gewerbeordnung).



In the context of our cooperation with our Insurance Partners, We are responsible for introducing You to our

Insurance Partners and for collecting the amount You pay for Your insurance contract (“Premium Payment”).



The insurance contract is carried out solely by the Insurance Partners. In that regard, the terms and conditions

of the Insurer provided in collaboration with Simplesurance are applicable. These terms and conditions are

provided to You in the sign up flow as well as in the welcome email upon sign up. A contractual relationship for

the insurance service is exclusively concluded between You and the Insurer. We do not have any influence on

the occurrence or non-occurrence of such a contractual relationship.



1.2 Scope

The Terms apply to all purchases of an N26 Insurance product (“Product”) through the N26 App. This does not

include the collective insurance as part of selected N26 accounts.



Unless agreed otherwise in these Terms, the General Terms for the N26 current account from N26 Bank AG as

well as the complementary terms for users of the N26 App as available under https://n26.com/terms/ apply to

the use of the Product.

Information concerning any changes to these Terms will be sent to You by email with reasonable notice prior to

the proposed time of their date of effectiveness. Your consent shall be deemed as provided if You have not

indicated Your rejection before the proposed time of the effectiveness of the changes. We will make a specific

reference to this de facto acceptance in Our offer. If You do not agree with the changes, You can terminate the

contractual relationship until the point of time the changes take effect without any prior notice. We will make a

specific reference to this right to termination in Our offer.



2\. Subject of the service



2.1 Scope of Service description

When You open the N26 Insurance section within the N26 App You will be informed about the Products offered

by the Insurer. After choosing a certain Product You will then be required to answer a number of questions. The

answers to these questions must be given truthfully and You are solely responsible for any inconveniences

resulting from inaccurate or missing information. The answers will decide about the applicable insurance

coverage as part of the insurance contract. You will be informed about the Premium Payment details and will

receive useful information, such as these Terms, the terms and conditions of the Insurer provided in

collaboration with Simplesurance, the insurance product information document and the insurance certificate.



In case You submitted false or inaccurate information or you did not submit all necessary information We can

freely decide to refrain from processing Your inquiry and We reserve the right to claim any damages arising out

of the aforementioned.



After You completed the purchase, the Insurance Partners will be responsible for providing the insurance

service to You and for answering any of Your questions. This includes, but is not limited to, administering Your

claims and initiating any payment after a successful claim.



We endeavor to make our services available to You at any time in the best possible way on the N26 App.

However, We do not owe or guarantee to You that You can reach the N26 App at any time.



2.2 Premium Payment

We will collect the Premium Payment from Your N26 account on behalf of our Insurance Partners. As an

insurance agent, We receive a commission directly from Simplesurance for our services, for instance for

bringing the Insurance Partners together with interested customers. As an insurance agent, We act on behalf of

the Insurer and not on behalf of You, however We also take the interests of the insurance policyholder into

account.



3\. Term and termination

Your contractual relationship with Us runs for an indefinite period of time. It ends automatically with the end of

Your insurance contract offered by the Insurer and administered by Simplesurance, if nothing else has been

agreed on with You. With the end of our contractual relationship with You, all of the rights granted to You in

accordance with these Terms end automatically. We and You can terminate this contractual relationship at any

time in text form (e.g. e-mail).

The right of termination for good cause remains unaffected.



The termination of the current account contract by You or by N26 automatically leads to the termination of the

contractual relationship subject to these Terms, however, the existence and effectiveness of Your insurance

contracts will not be affected. The termination of Your insurance contract requires a separate termination

declaration to the relevant Insurer in accordance with the provisions of the terms and conditions applying to

Your contractual relationship with the respective Insurer.

through N26 as an insurance agent. N26 cannot be held responsible for any incorrect and/or insufficient

information or documents provided by the Insurance Partners, such as the insurance certificate, insurance

product information document or the terms and conditions of the Insurer provided in collaboration with

Simplesurance.

a) technical reasons, e.g.:

○ faulty hardware,

○ faulty software,

○ maintenance work or

b) reasons outside of our influence, e.g.:
