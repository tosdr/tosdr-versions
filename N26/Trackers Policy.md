N26 Cookie Policy



(Version 3.8 – 06 June 2024)



Below you will find information about how N26 Bank AG, Voltairestr. 8, 10179 Berlin and its affiliates

(hereinafter ‘N26’, ‘we’) use cookies and other similar technologies on our websites.



This Cookie Policy will be updated from time to time and is accessible at any time on the N26 websites.



For the purpose of this Cookie Policy, the term cookie refers to cookies as well as similar technologies such as

pixels (hereinafter ‘Cookie(s)’). For more general information about Cookies, please refer to section II. of this

Cookie Policy.



I. What are Cookies \& why do we use Cookies?

Cookies are technologies used to store and read information from devices such as computers and mobile

devices. Cookies are typically used in order to make websites function, or function more efficiently. Without

Cookies, every website is simply losing its memory every time you visit a new page and open up the website

again. Websites wouldn’t remember who you are and what you did or what your preferences are. This can be

fairly complicated as much of the user experience you are used to enjoying on the internet when browsing

would cease to exist. Without this memory we, for example, couldn't log you in as we’d forget who you are. Or

we couldn’t show you the right language settings because we wouldn’t know where you are coming from. All

these useful functionalities which make websites so enjoyable wouldn’t be available.



Not using Cookies also means that your usage behavior can’t be analyzed. Some websites use Cookies to

remember what you do on their website, and to target ads at you. At first glance, that sounds bad from a user

perspective, but as Cookies also remember what you like, or what you don’t like, there will be no advertising - or

at least less advertising - that you’re not interested in. Another scenario is that Cookies will be used to

determine via which of our marketing partners you landed on our websites, or signed up to a bank account. If

you click on an ad on another website, websites use Cookies to let the website operator know that you’re

coming from them. Cookies aren’t automatically good or bad, but it’s worth understanding what you can do

about them and how you can make your own decisions on your data.



At N26, we use Cookies that are necessary for us to technically operate our websites. Additional Cookies are

used by our partners and us to process information related to your device (e.g. unique identifiers (of your

browser etc.), IP addresses) as well as data related to your interaction with our ads across the internet and your

usage of our websites. Please find detailed information in section II. below.

II. Cookies used by N26



1\. Types of Cookies used by N26



Cookies



There are several different types of Cookies depending on their origin and validity.



Cookie Type Explanation



First-Party-Cookies

First-Party-Cookies are being used by us as the

operator of the website and controller of the

associated data processing.



Third-Party-Cookies



Third-Party-Cookies are being used by a third party

that is also responsible for the data processing but is

not the operator of the website. N26 partners with

several third parties in line with the purposes

described in this section II. below.



Session Cookies



Session Cookies are Cookies that last for a browser

session. A session starts when you launch a website

and ends when you leave the website or close your

browser window. Session Cookies contain information

that is stored in a temporary memory location which is

deleted after the session ends. Unlike other Cookies,

session Cookies are never stored on your device.

Therefore, they are also known as transient Cookies,

non-persistent Cookies, or temporary Cookies.



Persistent Cookies



Persistent Cookies are stored on a user’s device to

help remember information, settings, preferences, or

sign-on credentials that a user has previously saved.

This helps create a convenient and faster website

experience. These Cookies have an expiration date

issued to it by the webserver. Basically, this type of

Cookie is saved on your device so when you close your

browser and start it up again, the Cookie is still there.

Once the expiration date is reached, it is deleted by

the owner. Persistent Cookies can also track visitors as

they move around the website to figure out what

people like about the website to help improve the user

experience, or to facilitate and improve the displaying

of ads.



Cookies that do not require your consent

Cookies that are strictly necessary to technically

operate our websites, as described further in this

section II. below.



Cookies that require your consent All Cookies other than strictly necessary Cookies, used

for the purposes as mentioned in this section II. below.



2

Pixels

A pixel, also known as a tracking or marketing pixel, is a 1x1 pixel graphic used to track user behavior, site

conversions, web traffic, and other metrics similar to a Cookie. The tiny pixel-sided image is usually embedded

in everything from banner ads to emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with web content,

such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place Cookies

on your browser.



Device fingerprinting

A device fingerprint - or device fingerprinting - is a method to identify a device using a combination of attributes

provided by the device configuration. The attributes collected as data to build the device fingerprint can vary

depending on who is building the fingerprint. Unlike web Cookies that are stored client side (i.e. on a user’s

device), device fingerprints need to be stored server-side — i.e. in a database.



2\. Your choice - what will you be asked to decide about and when?



When visiting our website, strictly necessary Cookies are placed. We inform you about the placing of such

Cookies transparently, upon your first visit to our websites, and every time the displaying of our Cookie consent

management tool is triggered (for example after Cookies are deleted by the browser). Such Cookies allow us to

technically operate our websites, in particular our online banking services. They are also necessary for security

and fraud prevention purposes. To ensure that our websites can be operated in a secure and reliable manner,

such Cookies are placed by default when you visit our websites and do not require your consent. You can find

further information on these Cookies at any time in this section II. below, or under ‘Cookie preferences’ in our

website cookie consent management tool.



Our partners and us only use additional Cookies upon your explicit consent. When visiting our websites, we will

explicitly ask you via our cookie consent management tool, whether you would like to consent to our usage of

additional Cookies, or whether you prefer to decline such usage. You will need to actively choose an option in

the tool in order to activate or decline the usage of these Cookies, and to be able to browse our website. You

can change your preferences at any time by re-opening our cookie consent management tool via a button on

our website. Additional Cookies are used by our partners and us to process information related to your device

(e.g. unique identifiers (of your browser etc.), IP addresses) as well as data related to your interaction with our

ads across the internet and your usage of our website. We process such data for distinct purposes: We use

Functional Cookies to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation, to prevent bugs, conduct A/B tests

and test new functionalities. Our partners and us use Analytics Cookies to analyze and improve the

performance of our websites, to customize our websites in order to enhance your experience and to

understand how effective our marketing campaigns are. Our partners and us use Personalisation/Targeting

Cookies to display personalized content to you on social media and the internet, based on your usage of our

website and your interaction with N26 ads on social media and the internet, to measure the effectiveness of

our ads across the internet and to build custom audiences to make our advertising efforts more relevant for

you.

3\. How can you revoke your consent?



You have the right to revoke your consent to use Cookies at any time. You can do so by changing your Cookie

settings. To change your Cookie settings please find the section ‘Update cookie settings’ on the bottom of our

website. In case Cookies are affected by the revocation of your consent process personal data, we will not

process your data for these purposes anymore. However, the data processing that has been performed until

receipt of your revocation stays legitimate.



4\. Cookies in detail



Strictly necessary Cookies



Strictly necessary Cookies are required for our websites to function. Data collected by these Cookies are

essential for us to operate our website as requested by you, in particular to provide information about the

financial services offered by us and to operate our online banking services, as well as for security and fraud

prevention purposes. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request

for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, browsing our site or logging in to our online banking.

Strictly necessary Cookies are therefore placed by default when you visit our website and do not require your

consent, neither does the associated data processing.

Our partners and us use analytics Cookies to improve the performance of our websites and services, in

marketing campaigns are. Analytics Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and

improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see

how visitors move around the site, in order to determine if we need to improve our websites for better user

experience. If you do not consent to our placing of these Cookies and the associated data processing we will not

know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.



Upon your explicit consent under Art. 49 (1) a) GDPR, analytics cookies may transfer personal data to third

countries, outside of the EU, such as the USA. This can be for different reasons like storing or processing. The

USA is a country that - in the terms of EU Regulation 2016/679 (‘GDPR’) - does not provide an adequate level of

protection of personal data; this implies, among other things, that governmental agencies in the USA may have

the right to access your data without effective remedies being available.

4.3. Personalisation/targeting Cookies



Personalisation/targeting Cookies may be set by our partners or us on our websites to measure our advertising

efforts, create custom audiences and make advertising on websites and on social media more relevant for you.

In order to measure our advertising efforts, personalisation/targeting Cookies set by our partners or by us can

detect whether you as a user are browsing our websites or social media channels after you have clicked on a

N26 ad. To make our advertising more relevant for you, our partners may use personalisation/targeting Cookies

to build a profile of your interests, based on your usage behaviour and your interaction with N26 ads and



18

match them by showing you personalised N26 ads across the internet. Such Cookies also perform functions like

preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads display properly. Further,

personalisation/targeting Cookies are used to create audience lists for N26 ads and better define user groups. If

you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less personalised advertising.



Upon your explicit consent under Art. 49 (1) a) GDPR, personalisation/targeting Cookies may transfer personal

data to third countries, outside of the EU, such as the USA. This can be for different reasons like storing or

processing. The USA is a country that - in the terms of EU Regulation 2016/679 (‘GDPR’) - does not provide an

adequate level of protection of personal data; this implies, among other things, that governmental agencies in

the USA may have the right to access your data without effective remedies being available.
