npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages.

npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community.

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

[tl;dr](#tldr)
--------------

* Be respectful.
* We're here to help
* Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
* Data published to npm is hosted at the discretion of the service administrators, and may be removed.
* Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the npm community.

[Scope](#scope)
---------------

We expect all members of the npm community, including paid and unpaid agents, administrators, users, and customers of npm, Inc., to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all npm community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to npm affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the npm registry, as well as the npm website, npm related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of npm, Inc. (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the context of the npm Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the npm abuse team.

[Friendly Harassment-Free Space](#friendly-harassment-free-space)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Disputes over package rights must be handled respectfully, according to the terms described in the [Disputes Policy](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/disputes). There is never a good reason to be rude over package name disputes.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of the Service is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

[Acceptable Use](#acceptable-use)
---------------------------------

The Service administrators reserve the right to make judgment calls about what is and isn't appropriate in published packages, package names, user and organization names, and other public content. Package that violates the npm Service's [Acceptable Use](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms#acceptable-use) rules including its [Acceptable Content](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms#acceptable-content) rules will be deleted, at the discretion of npm.

[Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct](#reporting-violations-of-this-code-of-conduct)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please select the method of contact you think is most appropriate for the form of violation:

* For urgent security issues, please open a ticket at [https://npmjs.com/support](https://npmjs.com/support). Requests to un-publish packages are not usually considered urgent security issues, as it is possible to [un-publish a package](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish) within 24 hours of its first publish. Any publicly published package is [immediately replicated to thousands of third-party mirrors](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/101934969510/oh-no-i-accidentally-published-private-data-to), so any confidential information contained in a package should be considered immediately compromised.
    
* If you believe someone is harassing you or is demonstrating some other form of malicious or inappropriate behavior, open a support ticket at [https://npmjs.com/support](https://npmjs.com/support). If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.
    
* If you have concerns about a potential copyright violation, please refer to our [Copyright Policy](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/dmca) and take action as recommended by that policy.
    
* If you think a package or other content is "squatting" on a name, follow the process described in the [Disputes Policy](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/disputes).
    

For any other issues, or if in doubt, [contact support](https://npmjs.com/support).

[Consequences](#consequences)
-----------------------------

All content published to the Service, including user account credentials, is hosted at the sole discretion of the npm administrators.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the npm administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

[Appeal and Reinstatement](#appeal-and-reinstatement)
-----------------------------------------------------

If your content or account has been disabled or restricted and you seek reinstatement or wish to appeal, please review GitHub's [Appeal and Reinstatement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-appeal-and-reinstatement) page for information about the process and use the [Appeal and Reinstatement form](https://support.github.com/contact/reinstatement) to submit a request.

[Contact Info](#contact-info)
-----------------------------

Please open a support ticket at [https://npmjs.com/support](https://npmjs.com/support) if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
