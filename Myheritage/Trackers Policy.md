### **Cookie Policy**

  
  

This Cookie Policy explains what cookies and similar technologies are, the different types of cookies that we use, how we use them when you visit our Website, and how you can control our use of cookies. Any capitalized term used and not otherwise defined below has the meaning assigned to it in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.myheritage.com/privacy-policy) or [Terms and Conditions](https://www.myheritage.com/terms-and-conditions).  
  
**What are cookies?**  
Cookies are small data files containing a unique identifier that are placed on your browsing device (such as a computer or mobile device) or stored on the web server when you visit some websites, including our website.  
  
**Which similar technologies are used?**  
Similar automated means of data collection technologies, include Pixels (which are also known as web beacons or action tags), SDKs (which are used on mobile apps) and local browser storage technologies.  
  
**Pixels -** A Pixel is a tiny image that may be found within web pages and emails, that allow us to gather information about visitors on our website—how they browse, what type of ads they click on, which email they arrived from, etc. Pixels can also allow us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.  
  
**SDKs -** A Software Development Kit is a downloadable software package used in mobile applications. A typical SDK may contain APIs which are pre-defined pieces of code that help you perform common programming tasks on the platform or other tools that help us do things like debug, build, run, and test our mobile apps.  
  
**Local Storage -** Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve your experience, for example, by remembering your preferences, and speeding up site functionality.  
  
**What are cookies and similar technologies used for?**  
Cookies and similar technologies enable us to differentiate between you and other visitors, and store information about your visit, which can both make it easier to visit the website again and make the website more useful to you. This information is notably used to improve the functionality of the services provided on the Website; for data analysis purpose; to detect and defend against fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity; to avoid displaying certain messages to you more than once; to save your login details so you won’t need to re-enter them each time you wish to log in, or to remember the display language you previously selected so you won't need to select it each time you visit the Website. Cookies and similar technologies are also used to make the advertising you see online more relevant to your interests. Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information (as defined in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.myheritage.com/privacy-policy)), while others are not. Cookies and similar technologies collect, retain, and share with third parties online personal identifiers and your browsing activity on our website. “Online personal identifiers” that may be shared with third-parties include data that may identify you and include, for example, device fingerprints, MAC addresses, advertising identifiers, and click ID. For example, when you arrive at our Website from an ad you have seen on another website, we may share back the click ID with the website you came from. In certain instances, an IP address may also constitute an “online personal identifier.”  
  
**What are the different types of cookies?**  
MyHeritage uses both "first-party cookies" and "third-party cookies".  
First-party cookies are cookies that are placed directly by MyHeritage.  
  
Third-party cookies are placed by our service providers or business partners on our website, and are used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising, and social media features. If the cookies are deployed (based on your consent or choice not to opt-out, as the case may be), the third parties will use the information collected through the cookies subject to their own privacy policies. See the table below for details about the use of third-party cookies and similar technologies on our website.  
  
Further, MyHeritage uses both “sessions cookies” and “persistent cookies”. Session cookies are only stored on your browser during a single browsing session to the site and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device until they are set to expire or until you or your browser delete the cookies.  
  
**What types of cookies are used on our website and why?**  
MyHeritage uses the following categories of cookies on our website. Note that some of the below cookies may not be active in some states or for some users. For the relevant list for you see the "Cookie info" or “Your Privacy Choices” link that appears at the bottom of our website.  
  

* **Mandatory cookies** enable the website to function and display properly and enable you to move around this site and use its features. They are also used to prevent security risks, set your privacy preferences, etc. Without these cookies, services that are necessary for you to be able to use our website, such as ensuring that you stay logged on or remembering what is in your shopping basket, cannot be provided.

  
[**Show cookies**](#)  
  

* **Analytics cookies**, which collect information on how you and other users interact with the website. They allow us to count visits and traffic sources to measure and improve our site's performance. These cookies are used to improve our website performance, understand what interests our users, and measure how effective our content is.

  
[**Show cookies**](#)  
  

* **Advertising cookies** (or targeting cookies), are used to better understand your interests, including which sites and ads you click on, and assist in delivering personalized ads that may be of interest to you. They also limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. If you do not allow these cookies, you will continue to see advertisements, but such advertisements will not be tailored to your interests.

**How to manage your cookies preferences?**  
Mandatory cookies do not require your consent.  
  
You can, at any time, change or withdraw your consent for our use of cookies by pressing the "Cookie info" or “Your Privacy Choices” link that appears at the bottom of our website. Additionally, to manage your cookie preferences, visit the “My cookie preferences” tab by going to “Settings” – “Privacy” – “Track with third party tools” or "Your Privacy Choices”.  
  
On our website we present videos which are hosted by third parties (such as the embedded Vimeo videos). When you play or interact with the video, the third party may track your activity and process your information in accordance with their privacy policy. We do not get any information from such third parties.  
  
When you login to our Service with your Google or Apple account, they will share with us your name and age (for age verification) and profile photo and will know you logged-in to our Service.  
  
**How to manage cookies via your browser settings?**  
You may also set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Many web browsers also allow you to block cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings). Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies entirely you will not be able to access secure areas of the website and may experience some loss of function in the services we provide.
