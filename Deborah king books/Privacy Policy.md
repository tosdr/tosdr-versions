Terms & Privacy Policy
======================

**We like to keep things simple. No legal jargon!**

This is our simple version of a privacy policy. Below this bit is several pages of more legal ways of putting it, which you’re welcome to read if you have insomnia. Basically, we want you and us to both be happy with how we use your data and if you’re not happy, please let us know: [dk@DeborahKingBooks.com](https://deborahkingbooks.com/privacy-policy/dk@DeborahKingBooks.com).

When you request a free offer from us, we take your first name and email in return. We use this to send you the free offer and we also subscribe you to our regular updates. This contains something nice for you (updates on our books, chances to be an advance reader or book related competitions if any are available). We will add something nice about us and what we are up to (new books coming out, author insights). So you get something nice, and we get the chance to let you know about our future books, which we hope you will enjoy.

We only ever have your email because you agreed we could have it, either via our own website or through a competition’s terms and conditions. Occasionally we receive your data as a hard copy (e.g., at an event) where we add you to the mailing list and then destroy the hard copy (we are not interested in filing cabinets full of email addresses; there isn’t the space in our offices).

You can always unsubscribe from our mailing list any time you’d like to. There’s a link at the bottom with our email. Any problems, email us and we will personally remove your details.

We keep your contact details safely on a respected mailing system (MailChimp). We do not sell your data. We hate it being done to us, so we are not about to do it to you!

This site uses cookies, which pretty much every site in the world does too. The cookies are there to remember things like whether you’ve already subscribed. You can disable your cookies (look it up on your browser help button) but this and other sites may then look or behave weirdly.

That’s it!

Now, here are the 5 extra pages of legal jargon we promised you. Sleep tight.
