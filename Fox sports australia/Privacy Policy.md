**2\. OUR PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy sets out what personal information (as defined in the Privacy Act) we collect about you and how we use and disclose your personal information. It also incorporates our Credit Reporting Policy which sets out how we collect, use and share credit related information about you.

The types of information we collect, how we collect it, how we use the information, and who we disclose it to, will depend on the Services you apply for or use, and the relationship we have with you.

3.2. **Information we collect automatically.** When you access, use or interact with us and/or our Services, we may collect the following information automatically:

We collect information about our suppliers and individuals employed by our suppliers (including service and content providers), contractors, dealers, agents and corporate customers, and their related companies. We will explain why we are collecting this information and how we will use that information, unless it is obvious from the circumstances.

  

**4\. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We, or service providers acting on our behalf, may use your information to:

**(a) Provide and administer the Services**

* (i) provide you with the Services;
* (ii) fulfill administrative functions associated with the Services (e.g. customer support, billing, payments, debt recovery and account management);
* (iii) respond to your enquiries, requests and complaints, and otherwise communicate with you (including on social media);
* (iv) assess your application or your credit worthiness for a Service and for other credit related purposes (including credit risk and bad debt reduction), as described in our Credit Reporting Policy (see section 6);
* (v) verify your identity when you apply for our Services or for credit with us;

**(b) Monitor and protect our Services**

* (i) monitor your call usage and data allowance in relation to your broadband/home phone service;
* (ii) monitor and analyse your use of our Services, IT systems, network and infrastructure, including for security purposes or fraud detection and network traffic management, including under our Fair Use Policy for broadband and home phone services;
* (iii) protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity including a breach of any of our Services’ terms and conditions;

**(c) Develop and improve our Services, marketing and advertising**

* (i) develop, measure and improve our Services and the products and services of our related companies, affiliates and business partners by performing research and data analysis of your use of the Services (including by measuring interest in our content and interactions with advertising) and by performing other data and statistical analytics. We may use third party analytics services (e.g. Google Analytics) and third party video measurement software (e.g. Nielsen and OzTAM) to assist with this;
* (ii) develop and improve, and measure the success of, our marketing and research, and to plan and execute our marketing strategies;
* (iii) measure the success of advertising on our Services;
* (iv) improve our Services by associating your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of providing relevant and easier access to content, advertising across browsers and devices, and other operational/business purposes;

**(d) Promote and Market**

* (i) promote and market our Services and the products and services of our related companies, affiliates and business partners;
* (ii) promote and administer our competitions, rewards programs, surveys, market research and events;

**(e) Deliver relevant content and marketing of our Services**

* (i) improve your experience by, generating customised suggestions/recommendations and delivering tailored content on our Services, and personalising the marketing of our Services to you, in each case, that we think you will find relevant and interesting. To deliver this to you, we may link information collected by us under this Privacy Policy, (including through tracking technologies or software such as cookies and device IDs), with information we hold about you as a customer of one of our Services;
* (ii) personalise the marketing of our Services to you on third party sites, apps or social media services, where we may match an anonymised common account identifier (such as a hashed email address) with third party sources to send you personalised communications (or to exclude you from receiving a particular communication) on the third party site, app or social media service;

You can control whether you receive personalised communications (see section 9).  
  
**(f) Deliver relevant third party advertising on our Services –** We may deliver personalised third party advertising on our Services. Personalised advertising (known as interest based advertising or addressable advertising) delivers you more relevant advertising based on your interests combined with other information (e.g. demographic and location information). Personalised advertising is tailored based on the information we hold about you as a customer and information collected about the use of our Services or your use of various sites or apps across the internet. We may also supplement this information with information collected from other trusted businesses with whom you have a relationship or from public sources. If you are using a browser, information collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies and software may be used to determine your likely interests and to deliver relevant advertising. If you are using a device that includes a resettable advertising ID, it may be used to determine your likely interests and to deliver relevant advertising. We may also use data connectivity platforms or other technologies to match an anonymised common account identifier such as a hashed email address with data from third party sources (e.g. third party advertisers) to deliver more relevant advertisements to you. We, our partners, third party advertisers, ad networks and technology providers also use the information for reporting and attribution, data analytics and market research. We may also share information with third parties to perform ad measurement services on our behalf.  
You can control whether you receive personalised communications (see section 9).  
  
**(g) Supplement your information and to derive customer insights**

* (i) derive customer insights about your characteristics, interests and preferences; and
* (ii) supplement it with additional information from publicly available sources, commercially available sources (e.g. data providers and advertisers), third parties with whom you have a relationship, and/or from our related companies, affiliates and business partners. We may share your information with these third parties so that they can do the same thing. Unless you have otherwise consented, where the information is provided to others for their own marketing purposes, it will not contain any information that personally identifies you;

**(h) Comply with contractual and legal obligations**

* (i) fulfil our contractual obligations, including by entering contracts with you or third parties; and
* (ii) to comply with our legal obligations, including under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), the Telecommunications Act 1997(Cth) and Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth), or any industry code or standard registered under an applicable law.

**(i) Other –** We, or service providers acting on our behalf, may also use your information for any other purpose as notified to you at the time of collection, or where you have provided your consent, if permitted under the Privacy Act, APPs or applicable laws, or for any other purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy.
