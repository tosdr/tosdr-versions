WOMBO Applications are provided as Freemium services, meaning that while basic features are available at no cost, certain premium features require payment. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of whether you are using free or premium features.

By Personal Data we mean (i) information that is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, and (ii) protected as personal data under applicable data protection laws.  
  
This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Data we or any third party collects from you offline or on any of our other apps or websites, including websites you may access through WOMBO Applications.
