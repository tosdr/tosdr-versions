**Cookie Policy**
=================

**1\. Our approach to analytics and cookies**
---------------------------------------------

Element uses cookies and other storage techniques to support key application functionality and to improve your experience of the Element applications and website.

### **1.1 What are cookies?**

Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Some cookies are key to the functionality of web applications, such as those allowing you to login. Another use of cookies is to help understand how you are using the app so that it can be improved.

Cookies can be first-party or third-party. First party cookies are only stored under the domain of the website that you are currently visiting, and can only track your movements in that domain. These are typically used for site functionality and to understand how you’re using that site only. Third party cookies are created by a domain other than the website you are visiting, and are used to track your movements across different sites. This is most often done to understand your internet usage and use that data to display more relevant advertisements.

### **1.2. What storage techniques do we use other than cookies?**

As well as cookies, Element also uses Local Storage, a web based technology similar to cookies, allowing larger amounts of data to be stored. This allows the Element app to store things like your chat history and room list on your device for faster access.

If you opt in to sending us product analytics, Element stores an Analytics ID in your account data on your Matrix homeserver to understand your usage across different devices and sessions. This is described in detail in the Product Analytics section below.

### **1.3. On our website -** [**Element.io**](https://element.io/)

[Element.io](https://element.io/) uses cookies to help us track anonymous usage of the website. This data helps us understand how our users are using our website so that we can improve it. For example, we can understand which content are people finding relevant, or be notified of pages that are slow to load.

Our website analytics are powered by [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/), a commercial CRM. Analytics data for [element.io](http://element.io/) is stored in Hubspot’s externally hosted systems and is private to Element. We don’t share this data with any third parties. For more details on this and other processors we use, please read our [Privacy Notice](https://element.io/privacy).

### **1.4. In our marketing campaigns**

Try.element.io is a subdomain of our website used for marketing campaigns. We use cookies on that subdomain to help us understand how our marketing campaigns are performing. Our analytics cookies are set only if you opt in to cookies for that page. We use analytics on try.element.io in conjunction with email analytics to understand how our content is being engaged across our communication platforms.

Our marketing campaigns are powered by [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/).

Example try.element.io pages include:

[Skype for business is end of life](https://try.element.io/skype-for-business-is-end-of-life)

[Secure collaboration for cybersecurity teams](https://try.element.io/secure-collaboration-for-cybersecurity-teams?pk_vid=25b93f1fd788bcc616397481948abbfd)

### **1.5. In our marketing emails**

Element sends emails to customers that opt in to receive marketing communications from us. Links in these emails that direct to our marketing website contain identifiers that are used to help us understand how our emails affect the traffic to our website, and how our content is being engaged with by users we send emails to. 

We send emails using [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/), a commercial CRM. Analytics data for marketing emails is stored in Hubspot’s externally hosted systems and is private to Element. We don’t share this data with any third parties. 

### **1.6. In our apps**

Element apps (mobile and web) store data on your device to support essential application functionality. Some examples of this functionality are:

* Maintaining a local copy of your chat history;
* Storing an authentication token so you don’t have to login each time you open Element;
* Caching data locally to reduce the number of network requests, in order to speed up loading time.

This data is not shared with any third parties.

Element Web stores data both in cookies and in your browser’s Local Storage.

Element Android and Element iOS don’t use cookies or local storage, but store similar data in native app storage.

### **1.7. Element Matrix Services (EMS)**

EMS uses first and third party cookies to support essential functionality. Some examples of this are:

* Fraud prevention;
* Storing a token so you remain logged in throughout your session and for redirecting users to the correct page after login and account creation.

EMS also uses analytics to understand how the EMS console is being used. When you are signed in to your account, Element may track your usage of the site and associate that information with your account details. This data helps us understand how our users are using the application so that we can make improvements to the Service.

**2\. Product Analytics**
-------------------------

Element apps send analytics data to Element if you opt in to collection of usage data. This data is used to improve Element products, and contains usage information and debugging telemetry. The data does not contain any personally identifying information such as Matrix IDs or room IDs. You can change your analytics collection settings at any time in Element settings.

Element’s app analytics are powered by the Free and Open Source analytics platform [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), hosted entirely within our network. We don't share any analytics data with third parties.

When opted in, Element’s app analytics generate a unique, anonymous Analytics ID for each Matrix account, which is used to identify usage of the same account across different installations of the Element app. This allows us to better understand how Element is used across different devices and platforms in order and improve the overall experience. The Analytics ID is stored in private account data on your homeserver in the key **im.vector.analytics**.

If you explicitly submit logs for troubleshooting via our **Rageshake** feature, Element receives detailed technical information about your use of Element, and identifiers such as your Matrix ID. You can find more details about that data in our [Privacy Policy.](https://element.io/privacy) 

**3\. List of Cookies and Identifiers**
---------------------------------------

### **3.1. Essential cookies and/or identifiers**

These are cookies and/or identifiers that are **‘strictly necessary’** and don’t require your consent, as we need them for the delivery of the services you are using. This means that we need these cookies to be used for the app or website to function properly, or to comply with security requirements.

Cookies with **‘session’** retention expire when logging out.

First party cookies are only stored under the domain of the website that you are currently visiting, and can only track your movements in that domain. Third party cookies are created by a domain other than the website you are visiting, and are used to track your movements across different sites.
