In the event of a conflict between any provision of these Terms and Conditions, on the one hand, and any specific terms and conditions for a particular U.S. News Service, on the other hand, the applicable provision of the specific terms and conditions for that U.S. News Service shall prevail with respect to your use of the U.S. News Services.

### **Featured Services**

Some of the features included in the U.S. News Services are provided by third parties. The companies that U.S. News selects as service providers offer products and services that site visitors may find useful. U.S. News in certain cases may have a business relationship with the third parties that it selects as service providers. U.S. News is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any advice or information given, or of any statement made, by the companies providing featured services, or for the content, services, products, or advertising on or available from their websites, or for the availability and operations of their websites.

### **Governing Law and Venue**

You agree that any claim, action, or proceeding arising out of these Terms and Conditions, or your use of the U.S. News Services, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts to be wholly performed therein.

Judicial proceedings (if any) that are excluded from the arbitration agreement in the Arbitration section below must be brought in state or federal courts located in New York County, New York.  You and U.S. News both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in New York County, New York.

### **Claims Deadline**

You agree to present any claims against U.S. News with respect to these Terms and Conditions and/or your use of the U.S. News Services within one year of the incident from which the claim arose, and you acknowledge that this expressly limits the applicable statute of limitations to one year.

### **Class Action Waiver**

**Please Read This Following Clause (the “Class Action Waiver”) Carefully—It Significantly Affects Your Legal Rights.**

You agree that by using the U.S. News Services, each of you and U.S. News are waiving the right and ability to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class action in any dispute arising from your use of the U.S. News Services.  **If you do not agree with this Class Action Waiver in its entirety, you are expressly forbidden from using the U.S. News Services.**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT ACT IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST U.S. NEWS IN ANY COURT OR ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES.  YOU AND U.S. NEWS MAY BRING LEGAL CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, NON-REPRESENTATIVE, AND NON-AGGREGATE BASIS).  THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTES TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR AGGREGATE BASIS.  Notwithstanding any other clause contained in these Terms and Conditions, this paragraph shall not be severable in any case in which the dispute is brought as a class, collective, representative or aggregate action.

This Class Action Waiver will survive the termination of the relationship between you and U.S. News for any and all claims or disputes you or U.S. News have relating in any way to the services provided by U.S. News or your relationship with U.S. News.

### **Arbitration**

**Please Read This Following Clause (the “Arbitration Agreement”) Carefully—It Significantly Affects Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court.**

You agree that by using the U.S. News Services, each of you and U.S. News are waiving the right to trial by jury.  **If you do not agree with this waiver in its entirety, you are expressly forbidden from using the U.S. News Services.**

You and U.S. News mutually agree that any and all claims, controversies or disputes arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms and Conditions or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, your use of any of the U.S. News Services or any services provided by U.S. News, your relationship with U.S. News, or any action or inaction by U.S. News, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be submitted to confidential binding individual arbitration in the federal judicial district in which you reside, except to the extent that you have in any way violated or threatened to violate any intellectual property right of U.S. News, in which case U.S. News may bring an action against you in any court of competent jurisdiction.

If you intend to seek arbitration, you must first give U.S. News written notice of your claim or dispute (the “Claim Notice”).  The Claim Notice shall be sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.collegeadvisor.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and shall (i) include your name, address and email address, (ii) list the U.S. News Services, if any, on which you have created an account and which newsletters associated with any U.S. News Services, if any, you receive, and (iii) describe in reasonable detail the nature and basis of your claim or dispute and the specific relief you request.  If U.S. News and you are unable to resolve your claim or dispute within sixty (60) days after U.S. News’s receipt of your Claim Notice, either you or U.S. News may commence binding arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/)) with JAMS and providing a copy to the other party as specified on the JAMS Demand for Arbitration and in the JAMS rules.  All such arbitrations shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as modified here.  The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at [https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/).  If for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your dispute with any national arbitration company under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA then in effect, except as modified here.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, only a court, and not an arbitrator, has the authority to resolve disputes concerning the validity and/or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver.  The arbitrator’s award shall be final and in writing and shall include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.  The award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Except as otherwise limited by these Terms and Conditions, the arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the JAMS rules (or the AAA rules if applicable), but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.

The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  Unless you and U.S. News specifically agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate any other claims with yours and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  An arbitration award applies only to the specific case in which it was awarded and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. 

Each of you and U.S. News understands that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision and jury trial waiver, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

For arbitration claims that you assert against U.S. News in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement (but not for any arbitration claim against you), U.S. News will pay all of your administrative, hearing and arbitrator’s fees and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses and costs of your lawyers, experts or witnesses, for which you are responsible) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay in order to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside.

This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of the relationship between you and U.S. News for any and all claims or disputes you or U.S. News have relating in any way to the services provided by U.S. News or your relationship with U.S. News.
