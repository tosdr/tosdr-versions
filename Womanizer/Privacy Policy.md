We use the following social media operators:

* Facebook
* LinkedIn
* Twitter
* Instagram
* Pinterest
* Snapchat

The operators of the social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) are involved in the operation of the websites just listed. They are also responsible (controllers) within the meaning of data protection law. We can hardly influence the data processing carried out by the platform operators and are dependent on the information the respective providers give us. To the extent we can exert influence and have a part in determining data processing, we aim to ensure that the operator of the social media platform treats the data in a manner appropriate to data protection.

#### **15\. Data processed by us**

The data you disclose using our social media pages, such as comments, videos, pictures, likes, public news, etc. are published by the social media platform.

#### **Data processed by the operators of social media platforms**

Social media platform operators use web tracking methods. Web tracking can be performed regardless of whether you are logged in or registered with the social media platform.

It cannot be excluded that the provider of the social media platform may use data, for example to evaluate habits, personal relationships, preferences, etc. In this area we have no influence on the processing of data by the platform operator.
