1\. Hilokal Service Overview

The Service offers a live-audio, social broadcasting platform that allows users to broadcast audio content in real time to other users of the Service. Those who broadcast on the service are called “Streamers” (formerly referred to as “DJs”). The Service also allows users to Post (defined below) chat messages and other User Content (defined below) and purchase Virtual Items (defined below) to use within the Service in accordance with these Terms.

2\. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms. Certain age restrictions may apply to the use of some features of the Service (including, for example, the purchase of Virtual Items (defined below)), depending on applicable laws and the policies of Hilokal and its third-party vendors.

3\. Accounts and Registration

To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account, which may include the ability to register through certain third-party account login credentials, such as Twitter or Facebook. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your gender identification, email address, phone number, birthdate, other contact information, and in some cases where legally permitted, you may be asked to provide a form of government identification. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password or third-party login credentials, if enabled by us. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and passwords, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at admin@hilokal.com.

4\. General Payment Terms

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable.

4.1 Price.  
Hilokal reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Hilokal will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Hilokal may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Hilokal gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Hilokal, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Hilokal’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

4.2 Authorization.  
You authorize Hilokal to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Hilokal, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Hilokal may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. In order to use a credit card for any payments in connection with the Service, you must be at least 18 years old.

5\. Virtual Items

5.1 Virtual Items.  
We may allow users to purchase virtual digital items (“Bean”) at a price determined by Hilokal. Certain features of the Service allow users to react to favored User Content with virtual digital rewards in order to express approval of the User Content. You may also use Bean to obtain digital items directly from Hilokal, such as extending the time Streamers may post User Content. The use and purchase of Bean (defined below) are transactions solely between the user and Hilokal. The term “Bean” is hereinafter collectively referred to as “Virtual Items.” Users can obtain Virtual Items in the various ways provided by Hilokal in its sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms. All non-standard transactions between users related to Virtual Items are prohibited. We may limit the amount of Virtual Items that you may purchase or hold at any time

5.2 Not Currency.  
Each of the Virtual Items perform different functions on the Service, and each are subject to their own terms and conditions, as specified in these Terms. They also have some things in common. In particular, Virtual Items are not money. While we may use terms like “buy”, “purchase”, or “sell” in reference to some Virtual Items, such uses are merely for convenience and do not mean that Virtual Items have any particular cash value. When you “send” a Virtual Item, you are sending it to Hilokal to display and register your approval of the referenced User Content. Any Virtual Items that you obtain or access on the Service are provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable license to use only on the Service. The Service may enable you to react to Streamers, users, or User Content; but any and all transfers of Virtual Items between users (including the transfer of accounts) not expressly permitted under these Terms or the terms and conditions of the Streamer Program are expressly prohibited, including any sale or exchange, whether direct or through an intermediary such as an auction service. Virtual Items are provided to you for entertainment purposes only. Virtual Items are not property, and you have no right, title, or interest in any Virtual Items, nor any right to exchange Virtual Items for any virtual currency or for government-issued currency, except as required by law.

5.3 No Liability for Virtual Items.  
Prices, availability, exchangeability, and transferability of Virtual Items are determined by Hilokal in its sole discretion and are subject to change without prior notice to you. Subject to applicable law and any other written and signed agreement entered into between you and Hilokal in addition to these Terms, you agree that Hilokal has the absolute and unrestricted right to manage, restrict, distribute, control, modify, withdraw, cancel, eliminate, change the prices or methods of exchange of, or reduce or limit the supply of Virtual Items in its sole discretion, and that Hilokal will have no liability to you or to any third party for exercising any such rights. Under no circumstances will Hilokal be liable to you for any damages or claims that may arise from the loss of Virtual Items, regardless of the circumstances. Without limiting anything in this Section, Hilokal’s liability to you for the loss of any Virtual Items, or the use or enjoyment thereof, will under no circumstance exceed the replacement of such Virtual Items, or the provision of alternative Virtual Items as determined by Hilokal at its discretion.

5.4 Virtual Items Purchase Terms.  
The purchase of Virtual Items is a transaction solely between the user and Hilokal. When you purchase Virtual Items on the Service, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Hilokal may use third-party payment processors to execute such transactions, and all such transactions are subject to the legal terms and privacy policies of our payment processors. By clicking to complete the purchase, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge your provided payment method (such as a credit card or debit card) the full amount of such purchase, including any taxes. All purchases are final and non-refundable. If you request a chargeback from your issuing bank after having authorized a purchase, and we believe in our sole discretion that you have not disputed the transaction in good faith, your Service account may be terminated with no recourse. In order to purchase Bean or other Virtual Items that Hilokal may make available, you must be at least 18 years old. Except where prohibited by applicable law, Bean expire five years from the date of purchase.

5.5 Eligibility for Streamer Program.  
Hilokal wishes to motivate users to post original, creative User Content that is of high quality and interesting for our users. To motivate users accordingly, users that act as Streamers on the Service may receive Bean from other users of the Service, and if a Streamer receives a certain value of Bean (determined by Hilokal at its discretion), then that user may be eligible to receive compensation as part of Hilokal’s program for Streamers (the “Streamer Program”). Any user that acts as a Streamer on the Service will automatically get enrolled by Hilokal in the Streamer Program, unless Hilokal determines such user is ineligible for enrollment in the Streamer Program. In order to receive any compensation or payouts in connection with the Streamer Program, a user acting as a Streamer must first accept the Streamer Program Terms (available here: \[[Streamer Program](https://spoonus.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058914893-Streamer-Program-Terms)\]) (the “Streamer Program Terms”), which are incorporated into these Terms by this reference, Hilokal is the sole decision-maker as to whether and how users may be compensated in connection with the Streamer Program or otherwise.

5.6 Forfeiture and Expiration of Virtual Items.  
Virtual Items expire five years after purchase, Bean may be terminated, forfeited, discontinued at Hilokal Radio's direction. If Hilokal terminates your Service account in accordance with these Terms, your license to all Virtual Items (including Bean, Gifts, and Coins) associated with your Service account will terminate immediately and all Virtual Items associated with your Service account will be forfeited, without compensation of any kind to you.

6\. Subscriptions

6.1 Automatically Renewing Subscriptions.  
Hilokal may, from time to time, offer subscriptions (“Subscriptions”) that provide bundled Virtual Items or features or opportunities not available as part of the free-of-charge service. If you purchase a Subscription, you are subscribing to an automatically renewing subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated frequency (e.g., monthly or annual) until cancelled. When you purchase a Subscription, you must provide accurate and complete information for a valid payment method that you are authorized to use—this information may be collected and processed by a third party app store or platform. If you purchase a Subscription, you will be charged your first subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically continue at the selected interval, and you will continue to be charged at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), unless at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period: (a) you terminate your account; (b) you cancel your subscription (as described below); (c) we decline to renew your subscription; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. The subscription fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in accordance with applicable law. If any subscription fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your access to the Service or cancel your Subscription. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts.

6.2 Cancellation.  
When you cancel a Subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your Subscription. You may initiate your cancellation at any time, but the cancellation will become effective at the end of your current subscription period. In order to avoid future charges, you must cancel your Subscription at least 24 hours prior to the end of your current subscription period. Subscriptions purchased through a third party app store or platform must be cancelled through that third party.

6.3 No Refunds.  
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED HEREIN OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS NONREFUNDABLE and if you cancel your Subscription, you will not receive any refund and you will continue to have access to your Subscription benefits, Virtual Items, and services at least until the end of your current subscription period. We reserve the right to issue refunds, credits, or discounts at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund, credit, or discount, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.

6.4 Termination. We may terminate your Subscription at our sole discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your Subscription, we may give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time or Virtual Items remaining that you cannot use; provided, however, that we will not be obligated to grant you a refund if we terminate your account or your Subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Service violate these Terms, any applicable law, or has harmed another user.

6.5 Changes. We may change the subscription terms or fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for your Subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your Subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a Subscription. Your continued use of the Service after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your Subscription. If you accept the new Subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward.

7\. Licenses

7.1 Limited License.

You must not Post any User Content to the Service if you are not the copyright owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of the User Content you intend to Post to the Service in compliance with the grant of rights set forth in Section 10.2. In addition, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording or an audiovisual work, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recording or audiovisual work, then you must not Post such sound recording or audiovisual work to the Service unless you have all necessary rights, authorizations, and permissions with respect to such embedded musical works that grant you sufficient rights to grant the licenses to Hilokal under these Terms. You represent and warrant that: (a) you own the User Content Posted by you on the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in these Terms; (b) the Posting and use of your User Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights, trade secret rights, contract rights, or any other rights of any party, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person visible in any of your User Content; (c) the Posting of your User Content on the Service will not require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and (d) the Posting of your User Content on the Service does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party.

10.7 User Content Disclaimer.  
We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content.

17\. Disclaimers; No Warranties

17.1 THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. HILOKAL DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (a) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (b) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. HILOKAL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND HILOKAL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

17.2 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR HILOKAL ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE HILOKAL ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

19\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

19.1 Generally.  
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Hilokal in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19.2 and 19.3, you and Hilokal agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, except as set forth in Section 19.7. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND HILOKAL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

19.2 Exceptions.  
Despite the provisions of Section 18.1 nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

19.3 Opt-Out.  
If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration and have not previously agreed to arbitration with Hilokal, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 19 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to HILOKAL CO., LTD., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 27 Dongil-ro, Nowon-gu, Seoul, 174-gil (Gongneung-dong, SEOUL STARTUP DIDIMTEO), Republic of Korea, 01849, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Hilokal receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 19 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 20.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

19.4 Arbitrator.  
Any arbitration between you and Hilokal will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Hilokal.

19.5 Notice of Arbitration; Process.  
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Hilokal’s address for Notice is: HILOKAL CO., LTD., 27 Dongil-ro, Nowon-gu, Seoul, 174-gil (Gongneung-dong, SEOUL STARTUP DIDIMTEO), Republic of Korea, 01849. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Hilokal may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Hilokal must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

19.6 Fees.  
If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Hilokal will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Hilokal for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, all hearings will be in the English language and the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

19.7 No Class Actions or Consolidated Proceedings.  
YOU AND HILOKAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Hilokal agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of you and only to the extent necessary to provide the relief warranted by your individual claim. Any claims for injunctive relief in favor of more than one person, the public at large, or otherwise seeking a public injunction must be brought in the state or federal courts located within San Francisco County, California.

19.8 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.  
If Hilokal makes any future material change to this arbitration provision after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us an Opt-Out Notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Hilokal’s notice to you of such change. By rejecting any material change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Company in accordance with the dispute resolution provision that was in effect as of the date you last accepted these Terms, as determined by the Company’s business records.

19.9 Enforceability.  
If Section 19.7 or the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, or if Hilokal receives a valid Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 20.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

20\. Miscellaneous

20.1 General Terms.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

20.2 Governing Law.  
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. For claims and remedies that are not subject to arbitration under Section 19 above, you and Hilokal submit and irrevocably consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.
