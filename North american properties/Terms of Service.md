Additionally, you agree not to: 

* Use any robot, spider, or other automatic device, process, or means to access the Network for any purpose, including monitoring or copying any Network traffic or resources available on the Network.

Monitoring and Enforcement. NAP, in its sole discretion, will determine whether your conduct is in compliance with these Terms. We have the right, but not the obligation, to:

* Monitor your use of the Network for any purpose in our sole discretion and as we see fit. This may include personal information, which will be used and stored in accordance with the North American Properties [Privacy Policy](https://www.naproperties.com/privacy-policy/).

You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts situated in the State of Ohio with respect to any dispute, disagreement, or cause of action related to or involving the Sites. If any provision is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.
