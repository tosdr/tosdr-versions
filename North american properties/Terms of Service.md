Additionally, you agree not to: 

* Use any robot, spider, or other automatic device, process, or means to access the Network for any purpose, including monitoring or copying any Network traffic or resources available on the Network.

Monitoring and Enforcement. NAP, in its sole discretion, will determine whether your conduct is in compliance with these Terms. We have the right, but not the obligation, to:

* Monitor your use of the Network for any purpose in our sole discretion and as we see fit. This may include personal information, which will be used and stored in accordance with the North American Properties [Privacy Policy](https://www.naproperties.com/privacy-policy/).

These Terms are governed by the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts situated in the State of Ohio with respect to any dispute, disagreement, or cause of action related to or involving the Sites. If any provision is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in our Sites, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and NAP with respect to your use of the Sites.

If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions (and any partially enforceable provision) shall not be affected thereby and shall remain valid and enforceable to the maximum possible extent. You agree that these Terms and any other agreements referenced herein may be assigned by us, in our sole discretion, to a third party.

Except as expressly stated herein, these Terms may not be amended.

NAP reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Sites with or without notice. NAP shall not be liable to you or any third party should NAP exercise its right to modify or discontinue the Sites. You acknowledge and accept that NAP does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to the Sites and operation of the Sites may be interfered with or adversely affected by numerous factors or circumstances outside of NAP’s control.
