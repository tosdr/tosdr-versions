* How do Beem payments work?
    
    _Beem_ is just like paying someone in cash.  It’s instant, easy and goes straight into their bank account.
    
    Just make sure that you know the person you’re paying because once the money’s sent, it’s in their account.  There is no backspace button.  Once it’s gone, it’s gone and we can’t reverse the transaction.
    
* How do I pay someone money?
    
    There are two ways that you can make a payment.
    
    From your contacts or with a _Beem_ username:  
    Select Pay, input **how much**, **who to** and **what for**, swipe right and it’s done.
    
    Using a QR code:  
    Scan the users code, input **how much**, **what for,** swipe right and it’s done.
    
* How to use QR codes to make a payment.
    
    QR codes are used on the platform as a convenient way to scan and pay. It helps users automatically populate the details for a transaction so it's quick and easy to then swipe and pay. 
    
    From the home screen, tap the **scan icon**:
    
    • SCAN CODE allows you to scan QR codes with the camera on your phone.
    
    • MY CODE displays your QR code with your username.  Other users can scan your code to send you a payment.
    
    • GENERATE allows you to create a QR code.
    
    • GENERATE A CUSTOMER CODE allows you to enter an amount and description that is unique to that QR code.
    
    • CREATE A COUNTER DISPLAY allows you to create a QR code that can be printed out and displayed on a counter.
    
* How do I create a link and/or QR code that I can share with others?
    
    From the home screen:
    
    • Select request.
    
    • Enter the amount.
    
    • Select ‘**Anyone with the link**’.
    
    • Enter a description.  
    
    • Slide to create.
    
    If you want to add a theme or graphics, you can make it extra special by adding a GIF or sticker to your message.
