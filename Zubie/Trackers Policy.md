**First Party and Third Party Cookies**
---------------------------------------

Our website may place first party cookies and allow third parties to place cookies on your device. The difference between a ‘first party’ cookie and a ‘third party’ cookie relates to the control of the party who serves the cookie. First party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website that created them. Our use of first party cookies enables us to operate an efficient service and to track the patterns of behavior of visitors. Third party cookies, on the other hand, are placed on your device by a third party (i.e., not by us). While we may allow third parties to access the Services to place these cookies on users’ devices, we do not retain control over the information supplied by the cookies. This information is controlled wholly by that third party and subject to their privacy notice/policy. The cookies that we commonly use are listed below.

**Third Party Cookies**
-----------------------

The following cookies are served by third parties on our Services. For more information about these cookies and how the third party may process data obtained by them, please refer to the relevant company’s website and privacy notices.
