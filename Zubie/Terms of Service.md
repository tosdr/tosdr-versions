[30. **BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**](#binding-arbitration-and-class-action-waiver)

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT**

**Initial Dispute Resolution**: Our Customer Support Department is available via email at support@zubiecar.com to address any concerns you may have regarding the Service. Our Customer Service Department is able to resolve most concerns quickly to our customer’s satisfaction.  The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Customer Support Department and good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

**Binding Arbitration**: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including without limitation its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Application and Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the AAA, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Zubie will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Zubie will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases.  The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

**Location.**  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.  For residents in Canada, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota, United States of America, and you and Zubie agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

**Class Action Waiver.**  The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. **YOU AND ZUBIE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING**. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

**Exception – Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims**: Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

**30 Day Right to Opt Out:** You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 30 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Zubie, 8120 Penn Ave. South/Suite 425, Bloomington, Minnesota USA 55431. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Zubie also will not be bound by them.

**Changes to this Section**.  Zubie will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this section.  Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day. For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Zubie agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue of the District Court of Hennepin County and the United States District Court for the State of Minnesota with respect to such matters.

You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of this Agreement or related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
