**Information Collection**  
We collect the following types of information:  
  
**Personal information** refers to information that identifies specifically who you are, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. We may also ask you for demographic information or other information such as ZIP Code, gender, date of birth and your interests. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. You may provide us with this personal information if you register with WeatherBug, for a personalized service, submit pictures, video or other user generated content, or participate in a promotion or sweepstakes. We or our affiliates may also derive physical address information and infer other general or precise location-related information from the information collected from mobile devices, such as the stores and other places the device frequents, or usage information for differentiating and/or associating multiple device users as well as associating devices or users with locations such as a household or workplace.

This data may be collected from our desktop properties or mobile apps even when you are not actively using the app.  
  
We may also collect data from certain third parties and combine that data with information we collect as described above or derive through analytical techniques, including combining personal and usage information together.  
  
**Location Information**When you have installed or use a WeatherBug service, such as one of our mobile applications, we may collect information about your device's precise location, including your location relative to and within third party merchant locations (in-store beacons). We may also collect data from cellular towers or WiFi networks near a device to infer the location of a device. Our affiliates including GroundTruth may also share location related-information with us. We may collect or receive location-related information even if you are not logged into or using the application.  
  
We use location information to operate and enhance our service as well as customize the content, weather alerts, and advertising we provide to you.

**Tracking Technologies**  
WeatherBug and our partners, affiliates, analytics, or service providers use cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, device identifiers, or similar technologies to analyze trends and use of our Services, administer the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base.

* Operating, maintaining, customizing, and improving our Services;
* Responding to your requests and questions;
* Providing personalized weather information;
* Delivering advertising we believe to be relevant to your interests, both about our products and the products of other third parties - for instance, we may use the location related data to present ads from a local business or use that and other data we collect to deliver ads that you may find more relevant;
* Performing analytics, research, and attribution, including predicting possible relationships among different browsers and devices;
* Monitoring the Services for compliance with the law and our terms of service;
* For product development; and
* Any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection.

**Information Sharing**

* With your consent.

Also, when you share information through our Services, such as photos or videos, some information about you may be made available to the public. If you would like us to remove your post from the page or application, contact us at [privacy@weatherbug.com](mailto:privacy@weatherbug.com).  
  
**Digital Advertising & Your Choices**  
We may partner with GroundTruth and with various third parties that engage in interest-based advertising ("IBA"). This type of advertising involves the collection of web viewing, location-related information and mobile application use data from our Services and other non-affiliated websites and mobile applications over time and across associated devices. This data is used to infer interests and deliver relevant advertising back to a browser or device, and to browsers and devices that are associated with each other. Browser Choice: For more information about IBA, and to learn how you can exercise choice regarding the practice on your browser for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") WebChoices tool, you can visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or TrustArc ([click here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)).  
App Choice: You may also download an application on your iOS or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of mobile application use activity for IBA on this device by companies that participate in those choice tools. Links to those applications are below:  
[DAA AppChoices iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8)  
[DAA AppChoices Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en)  
[TRUSTe mobile app iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/truste/id551047372?mt=8)  
[TRUSTe mobile app Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truste.mobile.consumer&hl=en)Location Data Choice: The DAA's AppChoices tool can also be used to exercise choice regarding the collection and use of precise location data by GroundTruth for IBA purposes. To limit the collection of precise location data by other parties through our application for a particular device, you can turn location services off through your device's settings.  
  
Note that electing to opt out from IBA will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, or reset your platform ad identifier, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. In addition, companies may still collect data in browsers or apps for non-IBA purposes such as for analytics and reporting purposes, operations, improving our or their Services, and frequency capping.

If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.

This section only applies to individuals that use our Services from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.

We process personal information to fulfill a contract to which you are a party, such as when you download the WeatherBug app and accept its Terms of Use.  We may also process personal information pursuant to your consent, such as when you voluntarily provide personal information to WeatherBug to customize your services. You have the right to withdraw consent at any time.  To exercise this right, contact us at [WB-Privacy-EU@weatherbug.com](mailto:WB-Privacy-EU@weatherbug.com).  

We also may process your personal data when it is in our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by your rights.  Our legitimate interests include processing personal data for: direct marketing; preventing fraud; sharing data among subsidiaries for internal purposes; ensuring network and information security; reporting criminal acts or threats to public security; establishing legally binding agreements with third parties; billing third parties; and taking internal measures to improve the functionality of the Services.

On other occasions, we process personal information where required by law.  We may also process personal information if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.

You have a right to the following:

·         To request access to the personal information we hold about you;

We will process and store your information only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law.  The criteria used to determine the period of storage of information is the respective statutory retention period.  After expiration of that period, the corresponding information is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or the initiation of a contract.

The personal information you provide to WeatherBug is stored on servers in the US and supported from the US. We also transfer personal information about you (whether collected online or offline) to our legal entities and affiliates and to service providers who perform functions on our behalf which are based around the world including in countries outside of the EEA, UK, and Switzerland and this information may be stored and processed in those countries which may have different data protection standards to those which apply in your country of residence.
