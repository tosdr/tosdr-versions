Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile devices; what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services; and how much such use will cost you. Nevertheless, all use of the Solution, including without limitation all use of the App and its related Mobile Services, shall be strictly in accordance with this Agreement.

9. **ADVERTISING.** Advertisements for WeatherBug or third party products and services will generally be displayed within the frame of the Solution.

WEATHERBUG ALSO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE SOLUTION WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR IN A MANNER THAT WILL MEET YOUR PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS AND/OR NEEDS.

IN PARTICULAR, EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE RESOLUTION, TIMELINESS, AND FORMAT IN WHICH LIGHTNING DATA ARE PRESENTED WITHIN VARIOUS DISPLAYS AND PRODUCTS DOES NOT PROVIDE A TOTAL SOLUTION WITH REGARD TO ADDRESSING CONCERNS REGARDING THE PRESENCE OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY AND/OR LIGHTNING AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE SAFETY OF PERSONNEL AND/OR SAFEGUARDING OF FACILITIES, WHETHER IT BE OF IMMEDIATE OR SHORT TERM CONCERN. INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE DATA, AS WELL AS ANY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND/OR PROGNOSIS OR SIMILAR ACTIVITIES DONE BY ANY USER, ARE DONE SO SOLELY AT THE USER'S RISK AND HAVE NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BEEN IMPLIED, CONDONED OR RECOMMENDED BY WEATHERBUG AND/OR ITS DATA SUPPLIERS. MOREOVER, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WEATHERBUG BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY DEALINGS OR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN YOU AND A THIRD PARTY, THE USE OF THE SOLUTION, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOLUTION, THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SOLUTION, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF WEATHERBUG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ADDITION, TOTAL LIABILITY OF WEATHERBUG FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO USE OF THE SOLUTION SHALL NOT EXCEED $500 (US) OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO WEATHERBUG (FOR USE OF THE SOLUTION) DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING ANY CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

22. **HIGH RISK ACTIVTIES.** You further acknowledge, without limitation of the foregoing, that the Solution is not fault-tolerant and is not designed or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Solution could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). WeatherBug and its licensors specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.

23. **U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.** Use, duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of the Commercial Computer-Restricted Rights clause at FAR51.227-19 when applicable, or in subparagraph (c) (1) (ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, or at 252.211-7015, as applicable, and in similar clauses in the NASA FAR Supplement.

25. **INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.** You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement, including, without limitation, violations or infringement of WeatherBug's intellectual property or proprietary rights, may cause irreparable injury to WeatherBug, whereby such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and WeatherBug would not have an adequate remedy at law. In the event of such injury or potential for such injury you therefore hereby agree that WeatherBug shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this Agreement.

26. **GOVERNING LAW.** This Agreement has been made in and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the State of New York. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in any federal or state court in the State of New York and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue and further to a jury trial in any action.

You may uninstall or delete the App at any time by utilizing the available uninstall or delete functionality offered by the applicable operating software or mobile device. However, by uninstalling or deleting the App, you will no longer be able to access the App's functionality or related services and will not be entitled to any refund of any amount paid for a subscription.

By downloading, accessing, or using the Solution outside the United States, you assume responsibility for compliance with the foregoing.

29. **WAIVER & SEVERABILITY.** WeatherBug's failure to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by you will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. If any part of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law or court order including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision(s) that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in effect.
