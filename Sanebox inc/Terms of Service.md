Terms of Service
================

of SaneBox

First, an apology
-----------------

Please don’t blame us. The lawyers made us do it. We just want to make it easier to manage your inbox. Turns out, in order to do that, you have to have a bunch of legalese accompanying your website. We’ve tried to make it easier on you by summing up the bigger paragraphs into small bullet points. Here’s the gist:

* New email still arrives directly to your email server Inbox. When the SaneBox algorithm determines an email doesn't deserve to be in your Inbox, it is your email server that moves it. At all times, during this process, your email server maintains possession of your email just like it always has.
* Your data is completely private. SaneBox algorithms analyze the patterns in your email behavior (which emails you open, which emails you respond to, how quickly, etc) to determine what’s important to you. Our robots never look at the content of your emails except when you choose optional features like Sane Attachments that require us to change that content. And our employees never ever look at the content.
* We are really good guys so if you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out to [support@sanebox.com](mailto:support@sanebox.com)

  
  

By signing up for SaneBox, you understand and accept the following terms of service.

THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TOS”) SET FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH SANEBOX MAKES AVAILABLE ITS PROPRIETARY EMAIL INBOX ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE OFFERING (“SERVICE”). BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TOS. REFERENCES IN THESE TOS TO “YOU” OR TO “USERS” ARE REFERENCES TO YOU, THE PERSON OR ENTITY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TOS ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THESE TOS WILL CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN SANEBOX AND SUCH ENTITY AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TOS.

If you enjoy SaneBox after your free two-week trial, paid subscription plans are available to fit your needs. Otherwise, you can cancel at any time.

Also, you must be at least 13 years old to use SaneBox.

Your use of the Service is expressly conditioned on your continued payment of the subscription fees applicable to the Service as set forth at www. SaneBox.com (the “Site”) and your acceptance of and continued compliance with these TOS. This Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old or possess legal parental or guardian consent. If you do not so qualify, do not attempt to use the Service. SaneBox may refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity at any time and may change its eligibility criteria, at any time, in its sole discretion.

We may need to alter these TOS. The revised TOS will be posted here at least 30 days before any changes take effect.

You acknowledge and agree that SaneBox may revise these TOS at any time \[by posting an updated version of these TOS on the Site at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of any such revisions. If you do not agree to any revisions to these TOS, you may terminate these TOS by notifying SaneBox in writing prior to such revisions becoming effective and SaneBox will promptly refund any amounts paid for the unused portion of the Service.\] By continuing to access or use the Service after SaneBox makes any such revisions, you agree to be bound by the revised TOS.

SaneBox isn’t a spam filter or virus scanner – we don’t look at the body of your emails or any of the information contained inside. It’s up to you to decide whether or not an email is safe to open.

**SaneBox is not a spam filter and does not scan for viruses or potentially unsafe messages.** The SaneBox algorithms intuit the importance of an email via various mechanisms. None of these mechanisms involves analyzing the body of the email so **it is left up to the user to make the final determination about the authenticity and safety of each email.** We strongly, strongly recommend that users never ever click on a link in an email. All links are suspect and should be dealt with extreme caution. The only safe way to interact with an email is to copy the link into a browser and see that the domain in the link is the domain of the business or person you know. Please be careful out there.

SaneBox places non-urgent emails into SaneLater, a folder you can sort through at your leisure. You can check this folder manually or receive our daily digest to see what we moved. We aren’t responsible for any consequences related to a delay in you seeing an email.

**SaneBox assumes that email is not meant to be a realtime medium of communication.** For instance, no one sane would ever send an email to request an ambulance. SaneBox puts emails into your SaneLater folder based on our prediction of what we think should be important. SaneBox is not responsible for any consequences related to the delay between the time a user receives their non-Inbox email and the time they read and process it. SaneBox is also not responsible for any consequences that may occur if the user incorrectly trains an email into their BlackHole folder causing emails of that type to be automatically filed into their Trash folder. SaneBox strongly, strongly recommend that users sign up to receive our email summary digest several times during the work day to enable them to stay on top of these “unimportant” emails and their most recent trainings. You can do this at [https://www.sanebox.com/dashboard/settings](https://www.sanebox.com/dashboard/settings). Once you sign up, you get an email summary digest once a day.

Privacy Policy
--------------

SaneBox respects the privacy of its users and follows the privacy guidelines defined in our Privacy Policy, which is available at **[Privacy Policy](https://www.sanebox.com/privacy)** and hereby incorporated into these TOS.

Accuracy and Security
---------------------

We’ve been at this a long time, and security is our top priority.

We seek to maintain reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or unauthorized access of the personally identifying information under our control. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security. As a result, although we strive to protect personally identifying information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted through or stored on the Site or the Service (including any computers, servers, storage devices or other computer or telecommunications infrastructure used in providing the Service, whether owned or operated by us or any third party).

On our end, we try our absolute best to protect against the loss or misuse of personal information, yet no system is perfect. In the unlikely event of a security breach, we have procedures in place to deal with the breach.

We strive to take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors. Any personal information we retain under our control is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access of the information under our control. For example, before we allow account holders to access their personal information, we verify their identity by requesting information such as their Sign-in ID and password. In the event of a security breach, we have procedures in place to protect our consumers’ data.

On your end, **keep your password safe and don’t share your account information with anyone.** You know the drill.

SaneBox account holders agree to keep their Sign-in IDs and passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access and use of their accounts. If you are a SaneBox account holder and have set your “Auto Sign-in” setting to populate your password and Sign-in ID automatically, please make sure you change the setting to \[Auto Sign-in Off\] before you let anyone else use your account or give your device to anyone else. You are responsible for all use of the Service under your account.

We use 3rd party subscription providers to handle financial transactions. While these are fine institutions, we do not represent them and take no responsibility for how they handle their security.

We have engaged 3rd party subscription providers to handle all aspects of your financial transactions involved with purchasing the SaneBox products. We do not represent and/or warrant the security or anything else regarding their systems. If you wish to review their security setup you can do that here: [pay.amazon.com/](https://pay.amazon.com/), [apple.com/apple-pay/](https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/), [paypal.com](http://paypal.com/), and [stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com/).

Use of the Site and Service
---------------------------

We reserve the right to revoke access to SaneBox at any time if you break the TOS. We may also revoke access at our discretion by giving you 30 days’ notice.

Revocation means you won’t be able to use SaneBox, but your email account will still be 100% accessible.

You acknowledge and agree that SaneBox may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or any folders within the Service) to you at SaneBox’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you, if you breach these TOS. In addition, SaneBox may terminate these TOS and your right to access and use the Service for any reason or no reason by giving thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to you. If we terminate the Service or these TOS for any reason other than your breach of the TOS or of any other contractual obligation to us, we will provide a refund of any amounts paid for the unused portion of the Service. You acknowledge and agree that if SaneBox disables access to your account, you will be prevented from using the Service and you may not be able to access information associated with your SaneBox account. However, any suspension or termination of the Service will not affect your ability to access your email account.

You do not have the right to use any SaneBox trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand folders.

These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the SaneBox trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand folders. No license to any software is granted hereunder. Other than the right to access and use the Service as expressly provided herein, all rights, title and interests in and to the Service (including all intellectual property rights embodied therein) are retained by SaneBox. Content contained in the Site is subject to applicable copyright laws and may not be used or reproduced in any manner without SaneBox’s prior written permission.

Our site may have links to other websites around the internet. We aren’t responsible for the content of these websites.

The Site may contain links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and operated by third parties (the “External Sites”). You acknowledge that SaneBox is not responsible for the availability of, or the materials located on or through, any External Sites or the privacy policies or other terms applicable to your use of those sites. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on such External Sites.

We love feedback! We are always trying to improve. If you send feedback, you are giving us permission to use it how we please.

At your discretion, you may provide feedback to SaneBox concerning the functionality and performance of the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, identifying potential errors, improvements, modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements (“Feedback”). While we appreciate it when users send us Feedback, please be aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post via social media or other channels without any obligation to you. By suggesting any Feedback, you hereby assign the ownership in all Feedback to SaneBox. In the event ownership in the Feedback cannot be granted to SaneBox, you grant SaneBox at no charge a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable right and license, with the right to sublicense, to use, reproduce, disclose, sublicense, distribute, modify, and otherwise exploit such Feedback without restriction.

Prohibited Use
--------------

You agree that you won’t tamper with or abuse our system in any way. Use it how it’s meant to be used, and we’ll both be happy!

As a condition of your use of SaneBox’s services, you agree not to:

* Access, tamper with, or use any non-public areas of the SaneBox’s systems or said system’s providers;
* Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the SaneBox’s systems or any related system or network or breach any privacy, security or authentication measures;

If you do anything to tamper with our system, non-public areas, algorithms, etc. we reserve the right to pursue legal action against you.

SaneBox will have the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of the above, including intellectual property rights infringement and security-related issues, to the fullest extent of the law. SaneBox may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate these TOS. You acknowledge that SaneBox has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the SaneBox’s services, but has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure your compliance with these TOS, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body.

We take GDPR very seriously.

Additionally, as of May 25, 2018, you agree that if you are a legal entity, then at any time when you have not accepted the SaneBox Data Processing Addendum (or when it is not in full force and effect for any other reason), you will be prohibited from Processing Client Personal Data regulated by EU Data Protection Laws (all capitalized references shall have the meaning defined in the said Addendum), and shall be obligated to immediately cease and desist from any such Processing, for as long as the said Addendum is not in full force and effect. This restriction does not apply if you are an individual. If you are a legal entity, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless SaneBox and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind which SaneBox may sustain as a consequence of the breach by you of your obligation pursuant to this paragraph.

[SaneBox’s Data Processing Addendum](https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=1c824283-6312-47d1-92ee-fac0c8fbcef4)

Warranties
----------

Your use of our services is at your own risk. We do not provide a warranty.

THE SITE AND THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ‘AS IS’, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SANEBOX EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. SANEBOX MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Indemnity
---------

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SaneBox, its officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services, or your violation of these TOS.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

We are limiting any legal liability we have to you.

SANEBOXTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT OF ITS USERS’ DATA. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SANEBOX BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TOS OR FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR ANY USER INFORMATION SENT THROUGH, STORED BY OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SANEBOX HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SANEBOX WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR TO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM OF ANY THIRD PARTY THAT RESULT FROM USE OF THE SERVICES.

IN NO EVENT WILL SANEBOX’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMING UNDER OR THROUGH YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID FOR SUCH SERVICES DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGE FIRST AROSE. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN SANEBOX AND YOU.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Severability
------------

In the event that any provision of these TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the TOS will remain in full force and affect.

Waiver
------

Almost every online Terms of Service page contains these three passages. Basically, we’re just reiterating what we said earlier and tying up any loose ends.

The failure of SaneBox to enforce any right or provision of these TOS will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver by SaneBox of any provision of these TOS must be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of SaneBox.

Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
--------------------------------

These TOS and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these TOS will be the state and federal courts located in and around Boston, Massachusetts and you hereby consent to and waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

Entire Agreement
----------------

These TOS are the entire and exclusive agreement between SaneBox and you regarding the Service, and these TOS supersede and replace any prior agreements between TOS and you regarding the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other SaneBox services, affiliate services or third-party content software or services.

Trademarks
----------

SANEBOX is registered trademark of SaneBox, Inc..

You Should Have Backups
-----------------------

SaneBox doesn’t send or receive mail. We monitor your email account and ask your email server to move non-urgent emails to a Sane folder. **At no point do we take possession of the email.**

Therefore, we are not responsible for your email in any way. No software is perfect, so we assume you have backed up your email accounts and have taken the proper precautions to ensure they are safe.

SaneBox does not participate in sending or receiving your email. We simply monitor your Inbox and when we see an email that is not Inbox-worthy, we ask your email server to move it to one of your Sane folders. Email messages that are processed by the Service are resident on your server and it is your email server that takes all actions on your email. The User, and not SaneBox, is responsible for maintaining appropriate backups of the email accounts used in connection with the Service.

Software will never be perfect. Neither your email client, nor your desktop computer or mobile device, nor your email server, nor SaneBox will ever be perfect. You have all had glitches from time to time with every computerized service and device you own. That is why you should all have your work backed up. You should have your email backed up. You should have your computer backed up. You should have your mobile device backed up. SaneBox assumes you are doing the common sense thing of doing simple backups for all that stuff.

We don’t do backups for you. We don’t have physical possession of your email. It is all on your email server. If your email server or client or computer has a glitch, you should go to your backups to recover whatever file, email, or corrupted piece of software that you lost. Hopefully, you have been backing all that stuff up for years, but you must know this already.

Refunds
-------

If you are not happy with our service, we hope you’ll tell us. We will try to fix anything about SaneBox that doesn’t leave you completely thrilled. If we can’t, we will cheerfully refund the amount within 30 days of purchase.

Store Credit
------------

SaneBox store credit is only redeemable for SaneBox subscriptions. SaneBox store credit is an incentive for our active customers to remain active. Any outstanding store credit will be cleared either when the you cancel your account or when your account is cancelled due to inactivity.

Email
-----

We obviously take SPAM very seriously. SaneBox is fully compliant with [CAN-SPAM](http://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business).
