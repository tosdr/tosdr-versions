------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SaneBox's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes "View Google API Services User Data Policy") , including the Limited Use requirements.

These same protections are applied to all other email services that connect to SaneBox.

**Your emails never leave your server**  
SaneBox never takes possession of them, and only analyzes headers to determine what's important. When optional features retrieve the body of email they are never stored.

**Your credentials are safe**  
SaneBox needs access to your Inbox, which means we need your password or OAuth token. Your credentials are encrypted with proven public key cryptography and stored on servers that are unreachable from the public Internet. The encryption keys are stored in hardware security modules to prevent theft.

**Your data is completely private**  
SaneBox algorithms analyze the patterns in your email behavior (which emails you open, which emails you respond to, how quickly, etc) to determine what’s important to you. We never look at the content of your emails.

**Active Directory integration**  
SaneBox can use Active Directory managed delegation to authorize access to Microsoft Exchange. In this case login credentials never leave your server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our mail processing servers never accept connections from the public Internet. All network access is provided through encrypted VPN tunnels via a bastion server. From there, our servers are accessed by our authenticated engineers via SSH, and all access is logged and audited. **There are no exceptions.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SaneBox uses an accredited services provider which means we take security, data integrity and business continuity very seriously.  
  
We insist on the operators providing the same physical access restrictions and controls to meet and surpass ISO standards. We require all of our data center operators to have and maintain ISO accreditation and to operate at the highest standards of physical security.

**These standards include:**

* Access approval and recording at the perimeter, the building and the data center suites.
* Pre-approved access requests via our ticketing system
* ID checks at reception with photo-id requirement. (passport/driving license)
* 24/7 CCTV and on-site security monitoring
* Biometric and key-fob controls at all entry/exit points so that all movement is recorded
* Access control expiry (date and time)
* Roof to ceiling enclosures to prevent unauthorised physical access within the data center suites.
* Racks are locked at all times and require a staff member to unlock them.
* Cabling is secured within overhead cable trays

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of our personnel is hand picked, fully vetted with internal methods. Only select senior engineering personnel are allowed to access our production servers, and access logs are kept at all times.
