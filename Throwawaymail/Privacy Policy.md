data.

European Economic Area (EEA), we may need to transfer your personal data to jurisdictions

outside the EEA.

4.2 Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect

it. For example, we will make sure that the jurisdiction in which the recipient third party is located

guarantees an adequate level of protection for your PD (e .g., the country in which the recipient

is located is white-listed by the European Commission or the recipient is a Privacy-Shield

certified entity) or we conclude an agreement with the respective third party that ensures such

protection (e.g., a data processing agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses

provided by the European Commission).

4.3 The European Commission has not found the United States and some other countries

where we and our Processors are located to have an adequate level of protection of PD under

Article 45 of the GDPR. We rely on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the

GDPR. We will use your PD to provide the goods, services, and/or

by law to store PD for a certain period of time (e.g ., we have to keep our accountancy records for

the applicable law and delete it as soon as the required retention period expires.
