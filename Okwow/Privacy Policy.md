**HOW IS THE COLLECTED INFORMATION SHARED?**

We use the information that we collect for several purposes including: to provide our services, send you samples or offers that you request, contact you regarding new promotions, improve our Site, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our customer agreements.  We limit how we share this information with others and only share sensitive information, such as phone numbers, when you provide explicit consent for us to share that information.  Below is a description of the ways we use and/or share the information you share with us based on the different types of data.

Phone number:  We treat phone numbers and phone-related data as sensitive information and, as such, only share it with others when you provide explicit, clear, and conspicuous consent for us to share that information.  In those instances where you agree to allow us to share your phone number with others, we only share that information with the company or companies you grant permission for us to share that with.  This is done during the survey section of the registration where you may see one or more advertisements based on your answers to the survey questions presented to you when you register.  For us to share your phone number, you must respond by clicking “Yes” at the bottom of the advertisement of the third party, where a clear and conspicuous disclosure is presented confirming the phone number you agree to share as well as the company(s) you agree to share your phone number with.  The phone data is ONLY shared with the third party when you explicitly agree to share that by clicking “Yes”. You can see an illustration of this opt-in process here:

When you register with us or use the Site, you may provide us with your mobile telephone number for the specific purpose of being contacted via telephone calls or text (SMS) messages.  When you provide us with your mobile number and check the box to sign up for text message updates and offers, you are providing us with your consent to receive automated phone calls or text messages from or on behalf of OK WOW, some of which may be conducted via an automatic dialing system.  Further, you understand that consent is not required as a condition of purchase.

We do not charge you for receiving mobile text messages, but message and data rates may apply from your mobile carrier or service provider.  Your mobile carrier may collect data about your wireless device usage.  Any charges from your mobile carrier or data collection by your mobile carrier are governed by your mobile carrier’s policies and not by our terms.  We may collect data in connection with the text messaging service, including your name, mobile number, mobile service provider or carrier’s name, and any other information you may provide us.  This information is used to contact you and provide the services as described within.  OK WOW is not liable for any undelivered messages or delays of text messages.

We might also use your phone number in an encrypted form of matching to verify if you have a current business relationship with another company.

No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties unless you explicitly consent to share your information with those companies.

We will not share your email with anyone else unless explicitly permitted by the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy and your express consent.**

**Direct Mail and Survey Data.** We may use the information we collect directly, indirectly, and in combination with data we share with other parties, to introduce you to informational, service, and/or product offerings of OK WOW and/or its subsidiaries, companies owned by the same legal entity as OK WOW, companies with no common ownership, third-party advertisers, assigns, and/or brands that are owned by, licensed by, and/or partnering with [okwow.com](https://okwow.com/) (collectively, “Associated Entities”) via direct mail. We do this by transferring, licensing, and/or sharing your information with Associated Entities so they may correspond with you and provide you with marketing materials and/or promotions that may be of interest to you via direct mail. Associated Entities may also transfer, and/or share your information with subsequent third parties that may want to advertise other products and/or services. This implies that once a third party obtains your information, its use is/will be controlled by the privacy policies and terms of use of that third party. Direct Mail and Survey Data sharing do NOT include email or phone number data unless you explicitly consent to sharing that information.

You may see any of these Third-Party Advertisers’ ads or offers on the Site or on websites, applications, and services operated by the Third-Party Advertisers. When signing up for the Site, you may be asked to complete a survey.  You may be shown a Third-Party Advertisers’ offer while completing the survey.  You may choose to skip any offer shown to you or you may choose to provide your information in response to the offer.  When you respond to any offer shown, we will transfer some or all the information that you submit during the website registration process to the Third-Party Advertiser. Once a Third-Party Advertiser receives the information you submit to them, their use of your information is controlled by the privacy policy of that third party.     

**Data Disclosure and Transfer: Legal Obligations:** We may also share your information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our employees, our web site users, or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.

**STATE DATA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

Some states have enacted data and/or privacy laws that apply to the residents of those states.  These state laws provide you with specific legal protections and restrict how we use and share your information with others.  Below is a list of the state laws in effect at the time this Privacy Policy was updated.

### **California**

If you are a resident of California, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information.  We may make your personal information available to third parties for their marketing purposes, as described in this Privacy Policy. We maintain the policy of only disclosing such personal information to third parties with your affirmative consent.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), along with its amendments through Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), empowers consumers by granting them rights to control their personal information held by businesses. These rights include knowing what information is collected, deleting it, opting out of its sale, and protection against discrimination for exercising these rights. The CPRA introduces additional rights, such as correcting inaccurate information and limiting the use of sensitive data.

Businesses under CCPA have responsibilities like responding to consumer requests and providing privacy notices. Penalties range from fines to potential damages for breaches, potentially reaching significant amounts for actions affecting consumers. It is important to add that the CPRA amends the CCPA; it is not a different law.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, and to opt-out of the sale/share of your information.

### **Connecticut**

The Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA), which came into effect on July 1, 2023, gives consumers control of their data and provides them with rights such as access to, correction of, and deletion of personal data, as well as the ability to opt out of data sale and processing.

The CTDPA applies to companies operating in the state as well as those targeting Connecticut residents, with specified data volume and revenue requirements. It imposes obligations on data controllers, including the requirement to limit data acquisition, maintain security procedures, and acquire consent. Sensitive data, such as racial, health, and genetic information, requires express opt-in consent.  The Connecticut Attorney General is in charge of enforcing the CTDPA, which carries fines of up to $5,000 per infraction.

The law is being implemented in stages, with companies given a grace period until January 1, 2025, after which more challenging compliance is required. Additionally, beginning in 2025, companies must provide consumers with a uniform opt-out method for targeted advertising and data sale.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

### **Virginia**

On January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) came into full effect in Virginia. Its main aim is to enhance consumer protection in the digital space. This act introduces broader privacy rights, defines personal information comprehensively, establishes protection for sensitive data, and sets data protection standards for those handling data. The VCDPA applies to businesses operating in Virginia or targeting its residents and handling personal data of a certain volume or deriving a significant portion of revenue from such data. However, certain entities like those under HIPAA, not-for-profits, and financial institutions are exempt. The act requires businesses falling under its scope to conduct and document data protection assessments, enforced by the Virginia Attorney General’s office with fines for violations reaching up to $7,500 each.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

### **Colorado**

The Colorado Privacy Act grants rights to residents over their data and imposes responsibilities on data controllers. Businesses must comply with notice requirements, obtain consent for certain data processing, conduct data protection assessments, and fulfill data subject access requests (DSARs). The CPA provides five main consumer rights: opt-out, access, correction, deletion, and data portability. It applies to businesses collecting data from a certain number of Colorado residents. Small businesses have exemptions, but penalties for violations under the CPA can be up to $20,000 per offense, capped at $500,000, enforced by the Colorado Attorney General without a private right of action.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

### **Utah**

The Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), effective from Dec. 31, 2023, marks Utah as the fourth state with comprehensive consumer privacy legislation. It resembles laws from Virginia, Colorado, and California but takes a more business-friendly approach. Its scope covers entities meeting specific revenue thresholds and processing data of a certain number of consumers. The Act provides fewer rights compared to other state laws, focusing on access, deletion, data portability, and opting out of specific processing. It excludes certain data types and grants exemptions to various entities, offering narrow enforcement and no private right of action.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

### **Texas**

Texas passed a new law called the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) which will become effective on July 1, 2024. This law affects how companies handle people’s personal information in Texas. It’s similar to laws in Virginia and California.

The TDPSA applies to almost any business in Texas or selling to Texans that handles personal data. Personal data now includes not just obvious information like names and addresses but also online usernames or other data that could identify a person.

Small businesses are mostly exempt, unless they sell sensitive data like health information, in which case they need permission first. Companies must be transparent about how they use personal data and must protect it from being misused. They must also limit the amount of data they collect to what’s really needed for their purposes.

Texans now have more control over their data. They can ask companies to show them what data is being collected, correct any mistakes, or even delete their data. They can also choose not to have their data used for targeted advertising or be sold to other companies.

The law also has rules for companies that process this data, making sure they follow the same guidelines as the companies collecting it.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

### **Oregon**

The Oregon Consumer Data Privacy Act (OCDPA) is about how companies can use and protect your personal information. It will become effective on July 1st, 2024. The OCDPA is similar to laws in other states and gives people in Oregon more control over their personal data.

The OCDPA applies to businesses that operate in Oregon or offer products or services to people in Oregon. The law requires businesses to be clear about what personal data they collect and why, and to only collect what they really need. Businesses must also protect personal data and reduce the risk of harm to consumers.

Consumers in Oregon have rights under the OCDPA. They can ask businesses to show them the personal data collected, correct it if it’s wrong, delete it, or get a copy of it. Parents or guardians can also do this for their children. The law also protects sensitive data, like health information or information about a person’s race, and requires businesses to get permission before using it.

The OCDPA does not let businesses sell personal data without permission. Businesses must give consumers an easy way to say no to selling their data. The law also has rules for how businesses can use personal data for targeted advertising, making sure it’s done in a fair and transparent way.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

**For Oregon consumers, you may submit your privacy requests via email, to the following address** [\[email protected\]](https://okwow.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**. Please include a valid government-issued ID, your full name, and your address. The information provided must match our records in order for us to process your request.**

### **Montana**

The Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act is a law that makes sure companies are honest about how they use people’s personal information in Montana. If a company does business in Montana or sells products or services to people in Montana, and they handle a lot of personal information from Montana residents, this law applies to them. However, it doesn’t apply to government agencies, schools, or certain types of personal information like health records or research data.

Under this law, Montana residents have the right to know if a company is using their personal information and can ask for a copy of their data or have it corrected or deleted. They can also choose not to let a company use their data for things like targeted ads or selling it to others. Companies must also keep personal data safe and not discriminate against people who exercise these rights. They have to explain clearly in a privacy policy how they use personal data and give people an easy way to contact them about privacy concerns.

Companies must be careful with sensitive data like genetic information or precise location data, and they can’t sell sensitive personal information to third parties without permission. Companies must assess the risks of their data processing activities and make sure that data is de-identified if it’s shared. If a company uses another company to handle data for them, they must have a contract in place to ensure data is protected. Finally, if a company violates these rules, the Montana Attorney General can investigate and take action, but the company has a chance to fix the problem first.

_What are your rights?_ To access, delete, correct your data, obtain a copy of your information, to opt-out of the sale/share of your information and targeted advertising.

### **Nevada**

Nevada’s privacy law, known as the Nevada Privacy of Information Collected on the Internet from Consumers Act (NPICICA), focuses on regulating how websites and online service providers collect and handle personal information of Nevada residents. Enacted in 2017, this law requires operators of commercial websites and online services to post a clear and conspicuous privacy notice. This notice must inform consumers about what personal information is being collected, how it will be used, and whether it will be sold or shared with third parties. Operators are also required to provide a designated request address for consumers to exercise their rights under the law, such as opting out of the sale of their information.

In summary, the Nevada privacy law gives consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information to third parties, which is a significant element of privacy protection. Operators must act on these requests and must not discriminate against consumers who choose to exercise their rights under the law.

_What are your rights?_ To opt-out of the sale/share of your information. However, we do not sell personal information.

### **Vermont**

In the absence of a specific statewide privacy law, Vermont residents have to refer to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare-related privacy and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) for the online privacy of children under 13. Also, Vermont has data breach notification laws that ask companies to notify individuals and the Vermont Attorney General’s office in the event of a data breach.

_What are your rights?_ To opt-out of the sale/share of your information. However, we do not sell personal information.
