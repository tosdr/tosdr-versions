The arbitration will be conducted in the English language in the city of San Diego, California by a single neutral arbitrator.

You agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. If for any reason this arbitration clause is unenforceable or inapplicable, both you and we agree, to the extent permissible by law, to waive any right to pursue any claims on a class action basis.

The illegality, unenforceability or invalidity of any provision is severable and shall not affect or impair the rest of our Terms of Use. No waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms of Use shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. Headings are purely for reference and shall not affect meaning. Any provision which must survive any termination of your agreement with us in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive.
