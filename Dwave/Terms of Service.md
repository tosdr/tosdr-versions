### H. Notification of Intellectual Property Infringement.

D-Wave respects the Intellectual Property Rights of others and expects you and all other Users to do the same.

D-Wave will respond to allegations of infringement of Intellectual Property Rights in accordance with applicable laws. If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes infringement and such infringement is hosted on the Services, or in connection with the Services or Materials, please provide written notification via regular mail or via fax (not via e-mail or phone) of claimed infringement to D-Wave at its head office (3033 Beta Avenue, Burnaby, BC, V5G 4M9 Canada, Attention: General Counsel) including all of the following elements:

(a) a physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the right that is alleged to have been infringed;

(b) a description of the Intellectual Property Right(s) that you claim have been infringed, including any legal registration of such Intellectual Property Right(s) and identification of what content in such work(s) is claimed to be infringing and which you request to be removed or access to which is to be disabled;

(c) a description of where the content that you claim is infringing is located on the Services;

(d) information sufficient to permit D-Wave to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number and e-mail address;

(e) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content identified in your notice in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner of the Intellectual Property Right(s), its agent or the law; and

(f) a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner of the Intellectual Property Right(s) or that you are legally authorized by the owner to act on the owner's behalf.

Before you file such a notification, please carefully consider whether or not the use of the Material at issue is protected by the 'fair use' doctrine, as you could be liable for costs and attorneys' fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use.

D-Wave will respond to clear notices of infringement consistent with Canadian law, and its response to such notices may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly infringing content, terminating the accounts of repeat infringers, and/or making good-faith attempts to contact the User who posted the content at issue so that the User may, where appropriate, take action to oppose any such notice.
