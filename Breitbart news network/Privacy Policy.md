This Privacy Policy was developed to help you understand what information we collect as well as how we use and safeguard the information you provide to us on our Site.

**Information We Collect**

Personal Information You Provide To Us Or Ask A Third Party To Provide Us

* We may collect personal information, including your name, cell phone number, email address, and certain demographic data, when you choose to voluntarily provide to us such information, such as by subscribing to a newsletter, making inquiries regarding our services, requesting breaking news alerts, reporting any problems with our Site, participating in a promotional offer, providing us with feedback on our Site, or otherwise.
* We may offer you various opportunities to engage in public activities and comment on articles on the Site. “Public activities” are any actions you take on the Site that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. In addition to our privacy policy, please see Disqus’ privacy policy: [https://disqus.com/privacy-policy/](https://disqus.com/privacy-policy/) for more information on how your data is handled when you comment on articles.
* You may choose to associate your social media account with our Site (_e.g.,_through Disqus, Facebook, Twitter or Google). By associating your accounts, you may be giving these third parties permission to send us certain information from your social media profile. What information they send us depends on your privacy settings with those third parties and their respective privacy policies. Once the accounts are associated, they may send us additional information from your profile over time. We will use the information they share with us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
* We also collect personal information from individuals who work for business contacts of Breitbart, such as service providers, vendors, and others.
* If you apply for a job posting, or become an employee, we collect information necessary to process your application or to retain you as an employee. This may include, among other things, your Social Security Number. Providing this information is required for employment.

Information Collected Using Technology

We may use this information alone or together with other personal information to individually customize the Site’s offerings and presentations.

In addition, advertisers may not recognize you when you return to their site.

**Links to Third Party Websites**

Our Site may offer links to other websites, including links embedded in advertisements and links to various news sources that are not under the control of Breitbart. Such links to other websites may have information policies and practices different from ours. In addition, certain companies associated with the Site may have their own privacy policies. We do not own or control such companies and websites and are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of websites that we do not own or control.

**How We Protect and Retain Your Information**

We use reasonable industry-accepted technology and controls to protect your data from disclosure to unauthorized third parties. Although these measures are typically effective, use of the Internet and related computer systems is inherently vulnerable to unauthorized access or “hacking.” No guarantee can be given that all information you provide to us will not be accessed by unauthorized persons. Thus, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

We retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Unless we obtain your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of such revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.

**Accessibility**

You may be able to enable accessibility features on our Site to make this Privacy Policy more accessible to you. You may also contact us using the information below to request an alternate format of this Privacy Policy.

**Notice to California Residents**

1. Marketing

California law permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared such information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request to [privacy@breitbart.com](mailto:privacy@breitbart.com).

1. Sensitive Information Disclosure

We collect the following categories of sensitive personal information (as defined under California law): an employee’s social security number, driver’s license, state identification card or passport number, an employee’s account log-in, financial account, password, or credentials allowing access to an account. This information is collected in order to process transactions, comply with laws, manage our business, or provide you with services. Note that we do not use such information for any purposes that are not identified within the California Privacy Rights Act Section 1798.121. We do not “sell” or “share” sensitive personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.

**Your Choices**

Some jurisdictions give you a right to make the following choices regarding your personal information. Note that your rights may vary depending on your jurisdiction.

* **Access To Your Personal Information.** You may request access to your personal information or confirmation that we have information about you. In certain limited circumstances, you may also request to receive access to your data in a portable, machine-readable format.
* **Changes To Your Personal Information.** We rely on you to update and correct your personal information. If our website does not permit you to update or correct certain information, you can contact us at the address described below in order to request that your information by modified. You may ask us to correct information that is inaccurate or incomplete. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.
* **Deletion Of Your Personal Information.** You may request that we delete your personal information. If required by law, we will grant a request to delete information, but you should note that in many situations we must keep your personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or for another business purposes.
* **Opt-out of Targeted Advertising.** You may opt-out of online tracking based targeted advertising (e.g., cookies) by clicking the cookie settings link [here](https://www.breitbart.com/), or by scrolling to the bottom of the webpage and clicking on “Cookies Settings.” Please note that if you change browsers or computers, or if you clear your browser’s cache, you may need to click the link again to apply your preference. We also recognize [Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) enabled by customers on their web browser or web browser extension as valid opt-out requests where required by applicable law.

* **Objection to Certain Processing.** You may object to our use or disclosure of your personal information by contacting us at the address described below.
* **Online Tracking.** We do not currently recognize the “Do Not Track” signal. This law also requires website and app operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personally identifiable information about their users’ online activities over time and across different websites and apps when the users use the operator’s website or app. We may permit third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites and apps when a consumer uses our Site.

* **Revocation Of Consent.** Where we process your personal information based upon consent, you may revoke consent. Please note, if you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information then we may no longer be able to provide you services.

Please note, not all of the rights described above are absolute, and they do not apply in all circumstances. In some cases, we may limit or deny your request because the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We will not discriminate against individuals who exercise their privacy rights under applicable law.

**Submitting Requests**

You may exercise the rights described above through our [online portal](https://www.breitbart.com/contact-us/dsr-form/). If you disagree with how we handled a request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us with the subject line “Appeal.”

Note that, as required by law, we will require you to prove your identity. We may verify your identity by phone call or email. Depending on your request, we will ask for information such as your name, email address, or phone number. We may also ask you to provide a signed declaration confirming your identity.

Designated Agent

In some circumstances, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf. We will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must attach authorization to act on the consumer’s behalf to the request. If we do not receive this information, the request will be denied.
