If anything in this Agreement conflicts with any usage rules for the Mobile App from an App Store Provider, such terms from the App Store Provider control (only so far as those terms conflict with this Agreement, and then exclusively for your use of the Mobile App). All rights you have to use the Mobile App are for use only on appropriate products (which may require branding from the App Store Provider or other entities) and are non-transferable, except that the Mobile App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via features like Apple’s Family Sharing (or similar features from other App Store Providers) or volume purchasing. We are solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for the Mobile App, as specified in this Agreement, or as required under applicable law. No App Store Provider has any obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services for the Mobile App, nor any warranties for the same.

**WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES RELATED TO ANY MOBILE APP.** However, in the event that the Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable warranty that we cannot disclaim according to applicable law, you may have the right to notify the App Store Provider, and the App Store Provider may refund the purchase price for the Mobile App. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO APP STORE PROVIDER WILL HAVE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE MOBILE APP, AND ANY OTHER CLAIMS, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, COSTS, OR EXPENSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY FAILURE TO CONFORM TO ANY WARRANTY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

We, not the App Store Provider, are responsible for addressing any claims relating to the Mobile App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation; and (iv) claims that the Mobile App infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights as well as the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.

By using the Mobile App, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You acknowledge and agree that the App Store Provider, and its subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your use of the Mobile App, the App Store Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

**VIOLATION OF TERMS OF USE**

You agree that BREITBART, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content within the Service or Site for any reason, including, without limitation, if BREITBART believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with your obligations under the Terms of Use or any other reason whatsoever.

**BREITBART FIGHT CLUB**

The Services contain a subscription-based content and news service with behind-the-scenes information, access to our top editors, and additional videos, audios, films and articles (“**Breitbart Fight Club**”). Your access to and use of Breitbart Fight Club are governed by these Terms of Use, and require you to submit certain information, including payment and financial information, to create a Breitbart Fight Club account (“**Subscription**” or “**Subscriber**”).

When you create your Subscription, you will be required to register a valid credit or debit card (“**Card**”). By doing so, you agree that we or our third party service provider and payment processors may charge and/or store such Card and you are solely responsible for any fees charged to the Card by the issuer, bank, or financial institution. Once your Subscription is authenticated and activated, the Card you registered with will be charged for the initial Subscription purchase. After your initial Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically renew on the interval you selected at the Breitbart Fight Club’s then current rates. We will bill you in advance for your Subscription. However, we reserve the right to change the timing of our billing as necessary.

We may, if applicable and solely determined by us, charge, from time to time, the amount for determining any fees, charges, or surcharges. You agree to pay all amounts billed for your Subscription, including all taxes as applicable. We may terminate or suspend your Subscription for any failure to timely pay amounts due or failure to provide up-to-date payment information for your Subscription. Any charges will be billed to the Card you submit to us for your Subscription. If your Subscription is disconnected for non-payment or for any other reason, then you agree to pay any amount due before we reconnect your access to the Breitbart Fight Club.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBSCRIPTION ARE NONREFUNDABLE. BY USING THE BREITBART FIGHT CLUB, YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ANY CREDIT, REFUND, PRICE ADJUSTMENT, OR OTHER DISCOUNT FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION, UNLESS EXPLICITLY APPROVED BY US.

As charges are prepaid each billing period, when you cancel your Subscription, you will be able to enjoy Breitbart Fight Club through the end of the then current billing period. When you cancel your Subscription, you may be subject to charges or fees.

The Services contain content, information, materials, computer code and software, of BREITBART (“**Breitbart Content**”) which is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws and BREITBART either owns and retains or licenses all Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) in the Breitbart Content, Site and Services.

**COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS**

If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Site infringe your copyright, you or your agent may submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”) notice by providing BREITBART with the following information in writing:

* a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright that is allegedly infringed;
* a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site;
* your name, address, telephone number, and email address and all other information reasonably sufficient to permit BREITBART to contact you;
* a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

Any notification that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon BREITBART actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to BREITBART a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.

**Email for notice:** [copyright@breitbart.com](mailto:copyright@breitbart.com)

* your physical or electronic signature;
* identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

**GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; DISPUTE; CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT** **OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY**.

ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER IN ARBITRATION OR PROCEED WITHOUT ONE. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF, HOWEVER, EITHER THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER OR COORDINATED CLAIMS PROVISION BELOW ARE FOUND INVALID, THEN THE SPECIFIC INVALID PROVISION WILL BE UNENFORCEABLE AND WILL BE SEVERED AND THE REMAINDER OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE.

**Agreement to Arbitrate**
--------------------------

You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy, including those known or unknown that may be later discovered, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, other agreements on the Services, or the [Privacy Policy](https://www.breitbart.com/privacy-policy/), or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be either determined by binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California before one arbitrator or submitted to small claims court in Los Angeles, California. If the arbitrator finds this location to be unreasonably burdensome to you, a new location may be selected or arbitration may be conducted over the phone, using video conferencing, or similar. You may be entitled to an in-person hearing near your place of residence. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.

**No Class Actions**
--------------------

YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS OR ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.

**Seeking Arbitration**
-----------------------

If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to us, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim (“**Notice**”). The Notice to us must be addressed to: Breitbart News Network, c/o Webmaster, 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049. If we initiate arbitration, we will send a written Notice to an email address you have previously provided to us, if available. We may also use any other means to contact you, including a message in your Account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by us, must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be downloaded from [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). If you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive Notice that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000 or the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.

**Hearing**
-----------

If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted documents, the arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.

**Award**
---------

In the event arbitration awards you damages of an amount at least US $100 greater than our last documented settlement offer; we will pay your awarded damages or US $250, whichever is greater.

**Injunctive Relief**
---------------------

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and we both agree that you or we may sue in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights or in other scenarios where injunctive relief is appropriate. In the event a court or arbitrator having jurisdiction finds any portion of this Agreement unenforceable, that portion shall not be effective, and the remainder of the Agreement shall remain effective. No waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

**Confidentiality**

You and we shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the Award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

**Coordinated Proceedings**

If 25 or more individuals initiate Notices of dispute with us raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or are coordinated for these individuals (“**Coordinated Claims**”), the claims shall proceed in arbitration in a coordinated proceeding. Counsel for the individuals and our counsel for shall each select five cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding (“**Test Cases**”). The remaining cases shall not be filed in arbitration until the first ten have been resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the Test Cases, each side may select another five cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process may continue until the parties have determined an objective methodology to make an offer to resolve each and every outstanding claim. A court will have authority to enforce this clause and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against us. Individuals bringing Coordinated Claims shall be responsible for up to US $250 of their filing fees or the maximum permissible under the applicable arbitration rules. All applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled while the Coordinated Proceedings specified in this Section are pending. We will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.

**Governing Law and Rules**

This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. You and we acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16). In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits. The parties adopt and agree to implement the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure (as it exists on the effective date of this Agreement) with respect to any final award in an arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement.

**Severance of Arbitration Agreement**
--------------------------------------

If the clauses concerning and describing the procedures and obligations related to Coordinated Claims and Test Case procedures is or becomes invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining entire arbitration agreement and any clauses concerning, relating to, specifying or otherwise describing the arbitration agreement shall be severed from this Agreement. However, any duty of confidentiality whether or not such duty is connected with arbitration shall survive such severance.
