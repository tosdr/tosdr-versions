* Version 5
* Last Updated February 01, 2023

The [](http://blendermarket.com/)[https://blendermarket.com](https://blendermarket.com/) ("BM") website (the "Site") is a web page operated by CG Cookie, Inc ("CGC"). [https://blendermarket.com](https://blendermarket.com/) is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the "Terms"). 

Your use of [https://blendermarket.com](https://blendermarket.com/) constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.

The Blender Market (“BM”) is a platform created to allow you to purchase licenses of digital goods through an online store. The products on the BM are owned by the author(s) (“Creator(s)”), not by us. We will not take ownership of the products or obtain any rights to use the products, other than to promote and make available such products on BM.

CGC does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from persons under the age of sixteen. If you are under 18, you may use [https://blendermarket.com](https://blendermarket.com/)  only with permission of a parent or guardian.

Becoming A Member:
------------------

To become a member of and use this website you must register and be at least 16 years of age. If you, your parent, or guardian has any concerns please feel free to contact us. Membership is free and required in order to buy products on this website, interact with Creator(s) of products, or publicly comment on products.

During the registration process, we will ask for information to help establish your account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information. To understand how we use this information review BM's Privacy Policy.

### Website Availability:

CGC works very hard to keep the website online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, though there may be times the website will become unavailable. We will not be liable for any loss you suffer as a result of website outages.

How Does Buying Stuff Work?:
----------------------------

When purchasing from the BM, you are purchasing a “grant of rights” or “license” to use the purchased product, not the actual product. Your use of such product must be in accordance with the licensed rights granted by the licensor of such purchased product. Different license types are available for you to choose from when you purchase a product.

Understanding which licenses you purchased from the BM is very important and your sole responsibility. Please take the time to review the different licensing options available on our [license page](https://support.blendermarket.com/article/54-available-licensing-options) and review the terms below, prior to purchasing products through this website.

#### Conditions of Purchase:

* The Creator(s) of any and all products retains ownership of such products;
* You’ve carefully reviewed the license options offered by the Creator(s) in connection with the product and agree it fits your usage scenario;
* There is no guarantee that the product will be available on the website forever, so it is encouraged for you to download such product and save it in a safe place;
* To use the product as intended and pursuant to the rights granted in the license agreement; and
* To not redistribute, resell, or share the products obtained from the BM to and/or with others. Unless authorized by the license purchased.

CGC works hard to ensure quality and to hold its Creator(s) responsible for their product. To review what Creators are agreeing to when supplying products to the BM, view [their agreement](https://support.blendermarket.com/article/44-terms-of-use-creator).

#### Product Support:

As a condition of remaining active on the BM, CGC encourages a reasonable level of support to be offered by Creators for their products. Support is offered by support conversations and documentation available on each item's product page. _If you feel this is not being offered then you may contact_ [\[email protected\]](https://blendermarket.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) 

Refunds:
--------

As a buyer, we want to make sure you are happy with each and every purchase you make at the BM and/or on any website on the Network. **_If you’re not happy, we are not happy!_**

If you purchase any product and it does not work, **WE FIRST ASK YOU CONTACT THE CREATOR AT THE CREATOR’S SUPPORT PAGE AND ASK FOR THEIR HELP IN RESOLVING YOUR ISSUE.** If after contacting the Creator, the product still does not work, or you feel the Creator misrepresented the product, please feel free to contact us and let us know the product you would like refunded, along with a detailed description of the issues with the product. We will investigate, and if the product is found faulty or not working as described, it will be fixed, or a refund offered.

_Note: Please, prior to contacting BM, first visit the_ Creator_’s documentation page for the product in question and ask the_ Creator _for support._

#### Arbitration:

You and CGC agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the website and/or Network’s website or your use thereof, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and that you and CGC are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of your use of the website and/or Network’s websites. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules") and as administered by the AAA.

**YOU AND CGC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING.** Further, the arbitrator shall not consolidate any other person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

You and CGC agree that this Agreement involves interstate commerce and is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and CGC further agree that applicable laws of the State of Illinois shall exclusively govern any dispute without regard to choice or conflicts of law rules. The sole and exclusive venue for the resolution of any dispute, whether or not subject to mandatory arbitration as described above, shall lie in the County of Cook, in the State of Illinois.

CGC may assign its rights and responsibilities hereunder without notice to you. The failure of a party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the terms and conditions hereunder will not constitute a waiver of the right or provision.
