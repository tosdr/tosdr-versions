**Cookies.** Like many other websites, we use cookies and other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. Cookies are small data files stored on your own computer's hard drive. They are generated by the Website. By assigning and storing a unique user name cookie on your device, we are able to offer you personalized collection, filtering and delivery of information that we feel will be of value to you, and we are able to save you the trouble of re-entering your contact information each time you visit the Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website, although certain functions and applications may be disallowed or not fully functional.

Here is some information about the different categories of cookies we may use:

* Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are essential to make this Website work. They enable you to move around this Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services that are necessary for you to be able to use the Website cannot be provided.
    
* Performance Cookies. These cookies collect information about how you have used a website, such as which pages are visited the most often, how people are moving from one link to another, and if they get error messages from certain pages. Overall, these cookies provide analytical information about how a website is performing and how the publisher can improve it.
    
* Social Media Cookies. To enhance your internet experience and make the sharing of content easier, some of the pages on this Website may contain links to third party social media service providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest. Through these links, the social media service provider may set its own cookies on your computer or device. We do not control these cookies and you should check the social media service provider’s website for further details about how they use cookies.
    
* Targeting Cookies. Some companies allow their advertising partners or other third party partners to use this type of cookie to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests. These cookies can remember that your computer or device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device’s browsing activity on other sites.
    

The length of time a cookie stays on your computer or device varies depending on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. How long a persistent cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the cookie to last. Session cookies are temporary and are erased when you close your browser at the end of your surfing session. The next time you visit that particular site, it will not recognize you and will treat you as a new visitor.

We may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services for online behavioral advertising.

**Click Stream Tracking.** We also employ “click stream tracking.” Clickstream or clickstream data reflect the specific web pages visited by an individual user, and the manner or traffic pattern by which a user moves from one page to another. We track and use this information to analyze trends, to understand how our users' habits are similar to or different from one another, to personalize the content, ads and promotions that you and other users see on our Website, and to administer the Website.

**Online Advertising and Analytics Providers.** We work with third-party network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers, and other vendors to provide advertisements on third-party websites and elsewhere online and to provide us with information about web traffic on our Website. These service providers may set their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you (such as usage information and device identifier). We also use Google Analytics, among other search engine tools, to analyze how the Website is used and to monitor its performance. We use the data gathered to diagnose and correct technical issues with the Website and to make improvements based on what users find most interesting or useful. To learn more about how to adjust your settings and the choices available to you, please visit Section 10 below.

**Social Media Plug-Ins.** We offer social media plug-ins for companies that include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. For example, we have Facebook like and share buttons, a tweet button for Twitter, and embedded videos that offer certain interactive features and we and the company track your interactions with these functions. Additionally, even if you do not choose to use these plug-ins, the relevant company may still collect certain tracking information about you and share it with us.

We may combine information we receive from other sources with information you give to us and information we collect about you. Depending on the types of information received, we will use the information received from other sources or the combined information for the purposes described in Section 3 (How We Use Your Information).

**Cross-Device Tracking.** We use data analytics companies, advertising networks, or social media companies, and the features they offer, to engage in “cross-device tracking,” which occurs when platforms, publishers, and advertising technology companies try to connect a consumer's activity across smartphones, tablets, desktop computers, and other connected devices. The goal of cross-device tracking is to enable companies to link a consumer’s behavior across devices.

Groupe SEB USA does not sell your personal information for monetary gain. Like many organizations, we engage third parties to help us deliver interest-based advertisements to you and may make use of third-party tracking technologies or other online marketing services. In doing so, we may make available or transfer your personal information (e.g., identifiers such as your IP address, geolocation data, and Internet or other similar network activity) to third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertising services, sponsored content providers, social media platforms, and other similar technology companies. These companies may use information about your activities on the Services – and other websites and services you visit across the various devices you use – to recognize you and your devices across the internet and to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Making such personal information available to these entities may constitute a “sale” of data under the CCPA. Please see your California Privacy Rights and Section 10 (Your Choices) for more information on how you can adjust your preferences.

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of individuals under the age of sixteen (16).

**C. California Privacy Rights**

If you are a California resident, the CCPA gives you certain rights concerning your personal information.

* **Right to know:** You have the right to request that we provide what personal information about you we collect, use, disclose, and sell. This includes the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 months.
    
* **Right to delete:** You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information that we have about you. We may not be able to fulfill your request if we (or our service providers) need to retain your personal information for certain authorized purposes, such as to provide a good or service you requested, to secure our Services, to protect against fraud, to improve our Services, or to comply with or exercise rights under applicable law.
    
* **Right to opt out of sale:** You have the right to request that we not “sell” your personal information. The term “sale” is defined broadly under the CCPA. To the extent that “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include interest-based advertising and similar data uses, you may stop this use of your personal information by adjusting your device or browser’s settings to limit how your online usage and device data is shared with third parties. You can refuse the installation of optional third-party cookies through your browser settings, and you may even be able to direct your browser to prevent the installation of third-party cookies by default. For your information on how to adjust your settings to opt out of these third-party cookies, please see Section 10 (Your Choices) below.
    
* **Right to non-discrimination:** You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment from us based on your exercising of any privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.
    

**D. How to Exercise Your CCPA Privacy Rights**

To exercise your rights, contact us at the contact details provided in Section 14 (Contact Us) below.

To make **a request to know or request to delete** your personal information, we may need to verify your identity (and if applicable, your agent’s authority to make the request on your behalf) before we are able to process your request. Only you or an authorized agent acting on your behalf have the ability to make the request related to your personal information.

To do so, we will ask you for certain information to verify your identity, such as your name, address and e-mail address. We also may contact you by e-mail to verify your identity and ask you additional questions, such as your last order with us so that we can match your identity with the personal information we have about you. In some instances, we may ask you to declare under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.

If you have an authorized agent who makes the request, then (i) we need proof that you have provided the agent power of attorney; or (ii) you must provide the agent signed permission to submit a request to know or delete; you must verify your identity directly with us; or you must confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

If we cannot verify your identity, or cannot confirm the agent’s authority to act on your behalf, we are not required to fulfill your request.

You also have the right to **request to opt out of the sale** of your personal information. As explained above, the term “sale” is defined broadly under the California Consumer Privacy Act. For more information on how to adjust your settings to opt out of third-party cookies, please see Section 10 (Your Choices) below.

**10\. CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with control over your information:
