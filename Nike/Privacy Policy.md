This Policy also applies to the personal information that Nike processes when you subscribe to receive marketing communications from us, communicate with us or engage with us via our Platform, or participate in contests, sweepstakes, and surveys.

Nike may provide you with additional privacy notices that will apply to certain personal information collected and processed by us. For example, we may provide additional notice to provide more specific information if you choose to take advantage of a particular partner promotion.  This Policy does not apply to your personal information if you work for us as an employee or independent contractor, apply for a job at Nike, or interact with third party partners or websites that are linked to or accessible from Nike’s Platform.

2.         Personal Information We Collect
==========================================

Nike collects personal information directly from you, automatically when you use our Platform or interact with us, and from third parties.   The definition of “personal information” depends on the applicable law of where you reside. For purposes of this policy, “personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual or household.  This does not include aggregated or de-identified information that is maintained in a form that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual or household.

3.         How and Why We Use Your Information
==============================================

Nike collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes the personal information we collect for the following business and commercial purposes:

* **To Provide the Features of the Platform and the Services You Request.** When you use our Platform, we will use your personal information to provide the requested product or service. For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com, we will use your personal information to fulfill your order and complete the transaction. If you participate in a promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the promotion. If you contact our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased, to help you resolve a problem or question.

If you use our Platform to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this personal information and store it so that you can review it in the Platform. Your fitness activity information may include information you enter about your activity or data collected by your device during your activity such as location and movement information. We may use this activity information to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the Platform.  
  
In many cases, to use particular features within our Platform you may need to provide Nike with additional information or additional consent to use particular information in a certain way. For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Platform, you may need to connect to a heart rate monitoring device. Similarly, to share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials to sign in.  
  

* **To Send Marketing and Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes.** If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the contact details you provide to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services, where permitted by applicable law (unless you have opted out). In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information.

Except for fitness and activity information (including Workout Info, defined below), we may use the information that you provide to us as well as information from other Nike products or services, such as your use of Nike’s Platform, to personalize communications and advertisements regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you. This may include information collected from your interactions with our Platform that are associated with your account across devices. For more information about how we use your fitness and activity information, see “[**Use of Fitness and Activity Information**](#Use_of_Fitness_and_Activity_Information)” below.  
  
We may also use information for event planning and management, including registration, attendance, connecting you with other event attendees, and contacting you about relevant events and services.

* **For Research, analytics, and improvement**. We use information to better understand how consumers engage with the Platform and our products and offerings, including consumer behavior and preferences. We administer surveys and questionnaires, such as for market research or member satisfaction purposes. We also use information for other research and analytical purposes, such as to evaluate and improve our Platform and business operations, to develop services and features, and for internal quality control and training purposes. For example, we may use information about how consumers engage with Nike.com to search for and find products, to better understand the best ways to organize and present product offerings in our storefront.
* **To Personalize Your Experience and Our Platform**. We use personal information, including inferences drawn from your personal information, to tailor and personalize your experience on our Platform.
* **To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services**. We use the personal information you provide to us to operate, improve, and maintain our business, products, and services. We may use personal information about how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our Platform. We also use information to consider and implement mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations, bankruptcies, and other business transactions such as financings, and as related to the administration of our general business, accounting, auditing, compliance, recordkeeping, legal and other internal functions.
* **To Protect Our or Others’ Rights, Property or Safety.** We use information to protect the Platform and our business operations; to protect our rights or those of our stakeholders; to prevent, detect and investigate actual or suspected fraud, abuse, illegal use, unauthorized or illegal activities and access and other misuse; and where we believe necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding situations involving potential threats to the safety or legal rights of any person or third party, or violations of our **[Terms of Use](https://agreementservice.svs.nike.com/us/en_us/rest/agreement?agreementType=termsOfUse&uxId=com.nike.commerce.nikedotcom.web&country=US&language=en&requestType=redirect)**.
* **To Comply with Legal Obligations**. We may also use your personal information as part of legal proceedings, to respond to legal process, and to comply with court orders, governmental requests, or applicable law. 
* **Use of Fitness and Activity Information.** We collect information about your fitness, activity, or your physical characteristics, some of which constitutes “Workout Info,” to provide certain services on our Platform. Because of the personal nature of this information, we strive to provide you with clear notice about how this information, including Workout Info, will be used. As this information may be considered sensitive in certain jurisdictions, we take appropriate measures in protecting and using this information and, where required by applicable law or under Nike’s internal policies, will obtain your consent for use of your fitness and activity information and Workout Info.

* **For Account Linking**. If you consent to link your Nike account with a membership account at a Nike partner, Nike will obtain personal information from the Nike partner, including your purchases and returns.  We use this information to give you access to selected benefits, such as access to exclusive Nike products, rewards, and experiences, when you shop with our partners.  Nike will also use the personal information to personalize your experience on the Nike Platform and to send your personalized marketing communications. 
* **Other purposes**. We may also use your personal information in other ways and will provide specific notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent where necessary.

We also use third party services to match information that we hold with personal information in their database to create custom audiences and tailor advertising to your interests on the Internet, including social media, as permitted by applicable law.

Providing tailored advertising services may be considered a “sale,” “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising, or “targeted advertising,” as defined by applicable law.

You may opt-out of cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising by using the relevant settings available in our Platform. Please see “[**Managing Your Privacy Rights and Choices**](#Managing_Your_Privacy_Rights_and_Choices)” below for additional information.

10.     About Cookies and Similar Technologies
==============================================

Nike, our service providers and third parties collect information, which may include personal information, from your browser, devices, or apps when you use our Platform using a variety of methods, such as cookies, pixel tags, identifiers for mobile devices, and other similar technologies. The information collected by these cookies and similar technologies may include your: IP address; unique cookie identifier and information obtained through cookies; unique device identifier and device type; domain, browser type and language, operating system, and system settings; country and time zone; previously visited websites; information about your interaction with our Platform such as click behavior, purchases and indicated preferences; and access times and referring URLs.

We use cookies and similar technologies to analyze and understand how you access, use, and interact with our Platform and our consumer’s preferences (such as country and language choices), as well as to assess, secure, protect, optimize, and improve the performance of our Platform. This enables us to provide services to our consumers and improve their online experience. We also use cookies and pixel tags to obtain aggregate data about Platform traffic and interaction, to conduct analytics, identify trends and obtain statistics so that we can improve our Platform. We also use cookies and similar technologies to target advertising and content across our Platform and third-party sites and services.

**_Third-Party Technologies and Services._** Some of the cookies and similar technologies we use are operated by third party companies. We use third-party services, such as Google Analytics and its advertising products, such as Google Signals and Google Ads, that may collect usage data (using cookies, pixel tags and similar tools) about our Platform to provide us with reports and metrics that help us to evaluate usage of our Platform, improve performance and user experiences, and serve relevant advertising to you. We also use third-party technologies and services, such as reCAPTCHA, to support the security of our Platform and protect against fraud and abuse.  In some cases, the processing of this data is subject to these third parties’ privacy policies (for example, for Google Analytics, see [Google’s Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and for reCAPTCHA see Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)).  
  
You may see our ads on other websites, such as our partner’s websites, because we use third-party ad services. Through these ad services, we can show you ads that may be tailored to your individual interests. These ad services may also track your online activities over time and across multiple websites and apps by collecting information through automated means. This data collection takes place both on our Platform and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad services.

**_Managing Your Cookie Preferences._** We make available several ways for you to manage your cookies within our Platform. Many of these are browser and device specific, which means that you need to set the preference for each browser and device you use to access our Platform; in addition, if you delete or block cookies, you may need to reapply these preferences. Further, opting out of cookies and advertising as discussed below does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising content from us. You may continue to receive generic or contextual ads from us. 

* **Mobile settings**. Some of our apps may include third-party advertising. You can adjust your advertising preferences on your mobile device at the device level. For example, turn off new app tracking requests, adjust your tracking preferences in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking. To adjust your advertising preferences in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads.
* **Industry ad choice programs**. You can also control how participating third-party ad companies use the information that they collect about your visits to our sites and your use of our mobile applications, and those of third parties, in order to display more relevant targeted advertising to you. If you are in the U.S., you can obtain more information and opt out of receiving targeted ads from participating third-party ad networks at **[aboutads.info/choices](http://aboutads.info/choices)** (Digital Advertising Alliance). You may also download the **DAA AppChoices** tool to help control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device.  
      
    Please note that opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or ‘contextual’ ads on our Platform. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.

* **Browser settings.** For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party accessing your web browser (through Nike Platform or otherwise), we recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose.
