TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

**User Terms**  

Effective 31 July 2024

Thank you for using Too Good To Go and joining the fight against food waste!

###   
1\. Joining the TGTG movement

1.1 We dream of a planet with no food waste. TGTG’s mission is to raise awareness of food waste and to reduce food waste worldwide. Our mobile application helps businesses and consumers fight food waste together by saving meals that would otherwise have gone to the bin (referred to as the “**Too Good To Go App**” or simply the “**App**”). With your use of the App you’re contributing to the goal of ensuring that all food produced is food consumed.

1.2 To support the goal we try to keep it simple and we provide an easy concept by which we empower consumers, like you, that use our App, collectively “**users**” (in these User Terms we refer to you as “**you**” or “**user**”) to save meals from retail and food service businesses like super markets, bakeries, canteens, restaurants, manufacturers and other businesses with surplus food (each a **“Store”**). Our App helps you to find Stores and reserve surplus food. Stores offer surplus food by listing a quantity of bags on the App they will fill with their surplus food and make available to be reserved by you (we call each of these bags a “**Surprise Bag**”). You may see Surprise Bags referred to by different names on the App depending on your geographic region. For purposes of these Terms, those too will be considered Surprise Bags.

1.3 As you use our App keep in mind, TGTG does not own, control, offer or manage the contents of any Surprise Bags made available by Stores for Reservation. TGTG is also not a party to the sale of the food that Stores provide to you in Surprise Bags.

###   
2\. What’s covered in these Terms

2.1 These User Terms (“**Terms**”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Too Good To Go (“**TGTG**”) that govern your use of the TGTG websites and App (collectively, the “**Too Good To Go Marketplace**”). In these Terms, the words “**TGTG**”, “**we**”, “**us**” and “**our**” refers to the TGTG entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting. By accessing or using any part of the Marketplace, you accept, without limitation or qualification, these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you are prohibited from using any portion of the Marketplace. The registration of an Account (as defined below) requires your express acceptance of these Terms.

2.2 These Terms reflect the way that TGTG works and among other things, the obligations that apply to our relationship with you. As a result, these Terms help define our relationship with you as you interact with us and use our Too Good To Go Marketplace. For example, these Terms include:

* What you can expect from us and our Too Good To Go Marketplace.
* What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our App.
* What to expect from Stores, which covers the basics of the interaction between you and Stores on our App.

2.3 Understanding these Terms is important because, by using Too Good To Go Marketplace you’re agreeing to these Terms. These Terms include all operating policies that are referred to herein (as such policies may be amended from time to time), including without limitation our Cookie Policy and our Privacy Policy that applies in your area.

By accepting these Terms, you confirm that you have read and accepted our Privacy Policy.

###   
3\. Using TGTG

3.1 **How to save a meal from waste using Too Good To Go.**

Too Good To Go App provides a simple method for you to save meals from the waste bin in 4 easy steps:

1. A Surprise Bag is made available by a Store that uses Too Good To Go for reservation by consumers like you.
2. A list of Stores with available Surprise Bags will be displayed to you in the App. Please note that a list based on your location can only be displayed if you allow the App to use location services where the App can track your location when you use the App.
3. You place a reservation of an available Surprise Bag from a Store you select in the App.
4. You Pick-up your reserved Surprise Bag at the relevant Store during the time period provided by the Store (see 3.5 below for Pick-up details).

3.2 **User Account**.

Your TGTG user account is where you manage the details of your relationship with us and use the App to make reservations with Stores. You must register and create an account by providing us with all the information we require during account registration or anytime after (“**Account**”) on the App. You must keep your Account information complete, accurate and updated. Any failure to provide or maintain this information may interfere with our ability to provide our services to you.

3.2.1 **You should never:**

* Select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person.
* Use as a username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization.
* Use as a username a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.
* Use another person’s Account or registration information.
* Share your Account with others.
* Publish, distribute or post login information for your Account or another’s.

3.3 **Reservations.**

You may reserve Surprise Bags available for sale by a Store by placing a Reservation with a Store you select via the App (each a “**Reservation**”). A list of active Stores with available Surprise Bags can be found on the App.

The list of Stores displayed to you is based on various criteria that you can filter for example by geographical location, pick-up time, or other options made available in the App from time to time.

**Keep in mind these two points**:

* By making a Reservation you reserve a Surprise Bag which may potentially be available from a Store. An example of when a bag you reserve is not available is when a Store does not have the quantity of surplus food available they originally projected, the Store may cancel the reservation (see 3.6 below).
* A Reservation is **not** a purchase, rather it’s an offer by you to the Store to reserve a Surprise Bag potentially available for Pick-up at the Store. The purchase of a Surprise Bag takes place upon Pick-up (see 3.5 below) at which time the purchase is exclusively concluded between you and the Store.

3.4 **Reservation Confirmation.**

Once we receive the Reservation, we will begin processing it by sending the Reservation to the relevant Store. We will notify you that the Reservation has been received and provide you with an order identification number (each a “**Reservation Confirmation**”) that is redeemable for a Surprise Bag at the applicable Store. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Reservation Confirmation in the App can be shown to the Store and swiped by you upon Pick-up.

3.5 **Pick-up.**

You must retrieve the Surprise Bag reserved on the App at the designated location during the time period stated on the App and in the Reservation Confirmation (“**Pick-up**”). Upon Pick-up, you shall show your Reservation Confirmation in the App to the Store, after which the Store will hand out the reserved Surprise Bag upon you swiping the receipt in the App. You should always make sure that the Surprise Bag handed out corresponds to your Reservation. If you do not Pick-up the Reservation within the time period set out in the Reservation Confirmation, the Surprise Bag may no longer be available and we will be entitled to charge you for the Reservation Price (as defined below).

3.6 **Reservation cancellation.**

At times Stores do not have the surplus food they originally anticipated or the surplus food may not be satisfactory to you. For these reasons and other, Reservations may be cancelled by you, Stores, and TGTG.

3.6.1 **Cancellation by you**

* **In App** - You may cancel a Reservation within the App at any time before the earlier of: (i) the conclusion of Pick-up or (ii) the end of the Pick-up time listed by the Store.
* **In Store** - You may cancel your Reservation in the Store for any reason any time before you Pick-up your reserved Surprise Bag. You must communicate your decision to cancel your Reservation to us via the complaint link in the App.

3.6.2 **Cancellation by Store**

Generally Stores may cancel your Reservation until one (1) hour before the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up. However, at times a Store may cancel later than one hour before the Pick-up time if needed (for example, if the Store sells out of the food they anticipated to be surplus at the time of Pick-up). If a Store cancels, you will receive a cancellation notification via email, SMS and/or the App provided you provided the correct contact information to us and that you agreed to receive such notifications.

3.6.3 **Cancellation by TGTG**

Reservations may be cancelled by us at our discretion when necessary, like in the event of a recall, dispute, or other matter we think requires that action to be taken.

### 4\. Contents of Surprise Bags

4.1 **TGTG’s role.** As the provider of the Too Good To Go Marketplace we have no insights into the contents of Surprise Bags. We do not own, control, touch, offer or manage any listings of Surprise Bags that Stores make available. We do not manufacture, sell, purchase, store, prepare, produce, process, mark, pack, deliver or handle the Surprise Bags. We have no responsibility or liability for the contents of the Surprise Bag (including the quality, ingredients, and allergens), for the information provided by the Stores or for the availability of information regarding the Surprise Bags on the App. We are exclusively an intermediary and as a result we are not a party to the sale of the food Stores provide to you in Surprise Bags. If you have any questions regarding Surprise Bags displayed on the App you should contact the relevant Store. The Store’s contact information will appear on the App.

4.2 **Store’s role.** Upon Pick-up and prior to swiping the Reservation Confirmation, the Store is responsible for providing you with information regarding the list of ingredients, allergens and other labeling-related information as well as the actual contents regarding the Surprise Bag. We are not responsible for any ingredient, allergy, caloric or other nutritional information provided by the Stores or otherwise found on the App nor will we assume any liability for any adverse reactions from content in the Surprise Bag for any reason. It is yours and the Stores’ responsibility to confirm whether any allergens are present in the Surprise Bag. If you are in doubt about allergy warnings, contents of a Surprise Bag or any other information, you should confirm with the Store directly before the conclusion of Pick-up.

###   
5\. Price, payment, refunds

5.1 **Price.** The Surprise Bags’ stated value on the App is a minimum value had the Surprise Bag not been sold as surplus food. All prices are indicated in the currency of the country in which the Store is located.

**Outside the US and Canada**: For all Reservations made outside of the US and Canada, prices include VAT.

**US and Canada**: For Reservations made in the US and Canada, prices are exclusive of applicable sales tax.

5.2 **TGTG as Store’s agent for collecting payments**. The Reservation Price you pay is collected from you by us on behalf of the Store. Stores have granted power of attorney to TGTG to receive payments from you on their behalf in full discharge of your payment obligation for the Surprise Bags you Reserve and the Stores sell to you.

5.3 **Packaging and other fees.** In some locations mandatory regulation requires adding a packaging fee or other fees for Surprise Bags. If applicable, such fee(s) will be displayed in the App.

5.4 **Payment process.** The payment flow may vary slightly depending on the selected payment method due to internal processes at the payment provider, but the flow described below is the typical flow associated with common credit cards. Upon placing a Reservation, the price listed on the App by the Store for the Surprise Bag (“**Reservation Price**”) is reserved to the payment method in your Account and completing a Reservation in the App authorises us to reserve the Reservation Price to the selected payment method. The Reservation Price is charged to your Account upon Pick-up or at the end of the Pick-up time if the reserved Surprise Bag is cancelled outside the parameters of 3.6.1 above unless local laws or regulations apply that require a different procedure. If a Reservation is cancelled in accordance with section 3.6 of these Terms, the amount reserved will be released or refunded to you if you were already charged without any other compensation owed to you (unfortunately some payment methods trigger immediate charge of the Reservation Price due to the payment provider’s internal processes). TGTG may amend, modify or restructure the payment procedure for its users at any time, as it deems reasonable.

5.5 **Payment method.** When completing a Reservation the Reservation Price will be reserved on the payment method (e.g. credit card) you have associated with your user profile in the App. You can pay with accepted debit and credit cards or by other payment methods made available on the App. If using a debit or credit card, you must provide all required information such as your card number, expiration date, security code and other details we may reasonably require. Any such information will be collected, stored and processed by TGTG’s payment service provider, and TGTG does not have access to the information.

5.6 **Refunds.** At times we may refund users at our discretion to resolve issues like complaints and recalls. When we do, we may provide refunds to users for some or all of the amounts collected in connection with a Reservation or Pick-up.All refund requests must be submitted to us within 30 days of the end of the Pick-up window for the Reservation. You will not be entitled to a refund if you submit a refund request to us after 30 days following the date of the end of the Pick-up window for the Reservation.

###   
6\. User complaints

6.1 Complaints should be submitted through the Help Center in the Account section of the App before taking any other action. You must include the reason you are unsatisfied and any other information reasonably requested by us. After receiving the complaint, we will process the complaint in accordance with our internal complaint practices and when needed in cooperation with the Store. These Terms do not limit the means otherwise available to you to resolve any dispute you have with the Store under applicable law.

###   
7\. Your responsibilities

7.1 We can’t cover everything here but we’ve highlighted a few areas that are an important part of your relationship with TGTG.

7.4 **Reviews.** At times you may have the opportunity to review Stores that you made Reservations with on the App. Any reviews that you submit through the App must be accurate and never contain any discriminatory, offensive, or defamatory language.
