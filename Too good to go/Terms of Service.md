TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

### 1\. INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Too Good To Go ApS’ app, which is owned by Too Good To Go ApS, CVR-no. 37561304, Landskronagade 66 , 2100 København Ø, Denmark (“TGTG” or “we”).

TGTG´s mission is to raise awareness of food waste and reduce food waste worldwide by making surplus food available for consumers.

We provide a way for the end user (“Customer”) to communicate his or her reservations for surplus food and other surplus products, including unspecified products in “Magic Bags” (“Products”) at food stores, restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, hotels, gas stations, etc. (“Stores”) displayed on our platform (the “Service”).

These terms and conditions (“Terms”) apply to any reservation and sale of the Products which are carried out via our websites or app (“Platform”).

When placing a Reservation Order (as defined below), the Customer accepts these Terms and thus, the Customer is required to review the Terms thoroughly before the Customer places an order on the Platform.

TGTG’s cookie and privacy policy, as available at all times on the Platform, shall form an integrated part of these Terms and shall be automatically accepted upon acceptance of these Terms.

### 2\. TGTG CONCEPT

The Products are made available for reservation on the Platform, and Customers may reserve the Products by placing a Reservation Order (as defined below) on the Platform.

The Products are reserved by the Customer when TGTG confirms through a Reservation Confirmation (as defined below).

Once a Customer reserves a Product and the Store accepts the Reservation, the Customer commits to be present at the Store at the Pick-up time (as defined below) while the Store commits to offer the Products for sale, as specified herein. Both parties have a right of cancellation as defined below.

TGTG is solely arranging the sale of Products on the Platform on behalf of a Store, and there shall be no contractual relationship between TGTG and the Customer with regard to the Products or the sale of Products. TGTG has no responsibilities in respect of the Products or fulfilment of the agreement between the Store and the Customer.

TGTG is solely collecting the Purchase Price (as defined below) for the Products on behalf of the Store and is thus merely acting as a payment agent on behalf of the Store.

### 3\. ACCEPTANCE

When placing an order on the Platform, the Customer confirms:

* To be legally capable of entering into binding agreements,
* to be a consumer shopping for personal purposes and
* to be 18 years old and in the possession of a valid debit, credit card or other payment means available for payment on the Platform.

By accepting these Terms, the Customer accepts to receive all relevant information in English. Furthermore, the Customer accepts that all agreements between the Customer and TGTG and any related information necessary for conducting the Services are stored by TGTG in accordance with TGTG’s privacy policy.

Furthermore, by accepting these Terms, the Customer accepts to receive emails and text messages related to any orders placed by the Customer. This is required by TGTG in order to ensure that the Customer receives all essential notifications related to the order.

TGTG reserves the right to revise and amend the Terms from time to time. The Customer’s order will be subject to the Terms applicable at the time when the Customer placed the order.

### 4\. TGTG’S CONTACT INFORMATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE

Too Good To Go

11 Curtain Road  

EC2A 3LT London

United Kingdom

### 5\. PRODUCT AND PRODUCT INFORMATION

TGTG is exclusively arranging the contract between the Customer and the Store and TGTG has no responsibilities in respect of the Products or fulfilment of the contract between the Store and the Customer.

TGTG does not, in any way, manufacture, sell, purchase, store, prepare, produce, process, mark, pack, deliver or handle the Products. TGTG has no responsibility for the fulfilment of the contractual obligations towards the Customer regarding the Products, including the manufacturing, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, marking, delivery, quality, ingredients, allergens or handling of the Products, and the compliance with applicable legislation, including with respect to the above, unless TGTG is explicitly designated as the manufacturer or seller of the Product on the Platform.

The Customer can find information about the Products and a description of the Products on the Platform. This information is only instructive and for the purpose of giving the Customer the best prerequisites for evaluating selected Products before making the reservation. There may be instances where the Platform is not updated and where the actual product range, stocked items etc. is not as stated on the Platform. In such cases, TGTG is of no liability. It is the Stores that are responsible for providing information about the Products and to ensure that it is factually accurate and up-to-date. TGTG does not undertake any such responsibility and, hence, has no liability for the contents of or availability of information regarding the Products.

If the Customer is in doubt about allergy warnings, contents of a dish or any other menu information, the Customer shall confirm with the Store directly before ordering. The Store’s contact information will appear on the Platform. The Customer may always cancel the Reservation Order, if the cancelation is due to ingredients, allergens or other labelling related information regarding the Product.

Upon Pick-up (as defined below), the Store shall provide the Customer with information regarding list of ingredients, allergens and other labelling related information regarding the Product. Any Products purchased via the TGTG Platform shall be consumed immediately after Pick-up and/or as instructed by the Product Label or the Store. TGTG will not assume any liability for Customers’ adverse reactions from Products for any reasons, including if consumed inconsistently with the labelling or the information set out in these terms or given directly by the Store.

TGTG is not liable or responsible for any failure to perform or any delay in the performance of any obligations relating to the Products, including with respect to manufacturing, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, marking, delivery, quality, ingredients, allergens or handling of the Products.

### 6\. RESERVATION OF PRODUCTS

A list of active Stores can be found in the app. If the Customer has allowed the app to use location services, the app will track the Customer’s location and the list will show stores near the Customer. Once the Customer has selected the Store and Product, the Customer will be given the opportunity to submit his or her order by clicking “reserve”, “place my reservation” or a similar button.

The list is solely established in consideration of a geographical criteria. The Customer has the possibility to filter the results in consideration of the availability of Products to reserve, of the Pick-up hour, of the nature of Products contained in “Magic Bags”, or as otherwise determined by TGTG.

The referenced Stores are the ones who are active on the Platform.

The supply of Products on the Platform is only an invitation to the Customer to place a reservation.

A reservation order made by the Customer via the Platform (“Reservation Order”) is considered an offer by the Customer to the Store to purchase a Product.

The Reservation Order shall be accepted by the Store upon Pick-up and, hence, the reservation shall be final and binding upon the Store and Customer upon Pick-up of the Product (as defined below), subject, however, to the limitations in the cancellation rights due to the nature of the Concept, as described in clause 7 below.

### 7\. RESERVATION CONFIRMATION

Upon receiving the Reservation Order, TGTG will begin processing it by sending the reservation to the relevant Store. TGTG will notify the Customer, that the Reservation Order has been received (“Reservation Confirmation”) and is being processed. Please note that any confirmation page that the Customer may visit on the Platform merely indicates that the reservation has been received and is being processed and does not mean that the reservation has been accepted by the Store

The Reservation Confirmation should be saved by the Customer. The Reservation Confirmation will contain information regarding the reservation placed by the Customer.

Please note that the Reservation Confirmation does not mean that the reservation is accepted, but is merely a confirmation of receipt of the Reservation Order.

### 8\. RIGHT OF CANCELLATION

TGTG’s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products and therefore, if the Store has no Products in excess, the Store may cancel the Reservation Order up until two hours before the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up (as described below). In this case, the Customer will receive a cancellation notification from TGTG or the Store via email and/or SMS/and or a notification from the Platform provided that the contact information provided to TGTG is correct, and that the Costumer has agreed to receiving such notifications.

Since the Products are perishable goods and since TGTG’s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products, the Customer can only cancel the Reservation Order up until two hours before the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up. However, the Customer may cancel the Reservation Order until Pick-up, if the cancelation is due to ingredients, allergens or other labelling related information regarding the Product.

The decision to use the right to cancellation shall be communicated by the Customer to TGTG via the complaint link in the Platform. If the Customer cancels the Reservation order outside of the rights set out above, the Customer will not be entitled to refund.

### 9\. PICK-UP

Products reserved on the Platform must be picked-up by the Customer at the stated pick-up address (“Pick-up”). The Pick-up time will normally be in a time period of 10-30 minutes but can be both shorter and longer. Store description and details about when and where the Products can be picked up will appear on the Platform and is stated in the Reservation Confirmation as well. If the Customer arrives at the Pick-up address before the specified pick-up time, we ask him or her to please wait outside for the sake of the Store’s guests. Be aware that if the Customer arrives too late, the Store may be closed and/or the Product may be unavailable.

Since the Products are perishable goods and since TGTG’s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products, the Store is entitled to sell the Product to another customer if the Customer does not Pick-up the Reservation Order within the time period set out in the Reservation Confirmation. In this event, TGTG is entitled to charge the Purchase Price (as defined below) from the Customer.

Upon Pick-up, the Customer shall show his or her Reservation Confirmation in the TGTG app to the Store’s employees, after which they will “swipe” the receipt and hand out the Products reserved. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the Reservation Confirmation in the app can be shown at Pick-up. The Customer is required to make sure that the Products and number of Products handed out correspond to the Customer’s reservation.

### 10\. PRICE

All prices are indicated in the currency of the country in which the Store is located and is including applicable VAT but may exclude any online payment administration charges, unless otherwise is specified.

Any fees related to the order and payment will be calculated and listed when the Customer places the Reservation Order.

Any value of the Products stated on the Platform is a minimum value had the Products not been sold as surplus food.

### 11\. PAYMENT

The Customer can pay with several brands of debit and credit cards as well as other payment methods made available on the Platform.

If using credit or debit card, the Customer must enter his or her card number, the expiration date and the security code when placing a Reservation Order.

Upon placing a Reservation Order, the amount stipulated by the Store for the Products (“Purchase Price”) is authorized or reserved at the Customer´s account (depending on the chosen payment method) (“Account”). The Purchase Price is charged at the Customer´s account upon reservation of the Product or at or immediately after Pick-up (depending on the chosen method of payment). If the reservation is cancelled in accordance with these Terms, the Purchase Price is cancelled or refunded to Customer.

The Purchase Price is collected by TGTG from the Customer on behalf of the Store. TGTG may amend, modify or restructure the payment procedure for its Customers, as it deems reasonable.

The Platform uses PCI compliant Payment Service Providers. Payment by debit or credit card on the Platform is safe and certified by the card issuer. All payments are made through an encrypted internet connection.

TGTG does not store any debit or credit card information. Such information is handled by the Payment Service Providers. However, such information may be stored by the Payment Service Providers.

If the Customer’s credit card or payment method is rejected when trying to pay for an order, the Customer should verify that the entered information is correct.

If the Customer has corrected the error and the credit card is still rejected, TGTG recommends that the Customer contacts his or her bank.

Due to standard banking procedures, once the Customer has submitted a Reservation Order by use of a credit or debit card and the payment has been authorized, the bank or card issuer will reserve the full amount of the Reservation Order If the Reservation Order is subsequently rejected by the Store or cancelled for any other reason in accordance with these Terms, the bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the order to TGTG and will instead refund the Customer by releasing the relevant amount back into the Customer’s available balance. However, this may take up to 10 working days (or longer, depending on the Customer’s bank or card issuer), and TGTG does not have authority to make enquiries to a Customer’s bank or card issuer on specific payment issues. The Customer must do so.

By accepting these Terms, the Customer accepts the method of payment set out above and acknowledges and agrees that TGTG is not responsible or liable to the Customer in relation to the above.

### 12\. RIGHT OF COMPLAINT

In case of a complaint concerning a Product (including the “Magic Bag” and its contents), the Customer shall address the complaint to the Customer Service of TGTG before considering any other action. TGTG will handle all claims ((including with respect to the “Magic Bag” and its contents) as TGTG deems correct and any decision by TGTG regarding the Product is entirely up to TGTG.

In the event that the intervention of TGTG is not to the satisfaction of the Customer, these Terms do not limit the means available to the Customer to resolve the dispute it has with the Store under statutory law. The Services are covered by statutory consumer protection legislation and other statutory legislation regarding purchase of goods (in Denmark Købeloven) and provisions set out herein regarding defects and delays.

All complaints are handled exclusively by TGTG and the Customer shall direct complaints against TGTG and not the Store.

The Customer shall verify the content of the Products upon receipt.

In case of a complaint, the Customer shall contact TGTG via the complaint link on the Platform and provide the requested information and information about the Products and why the Customer is unsatisfied. After receiving the complaint, TGTG will process the complaint in cooperation with the Store if relevant and the Customer will receive a reply from TGTG within 10 business days.

In case the Customer is not satisfied with TGTG’s reply, the Customer may submit a complaint to the relevant consumer protection authority (in Denmark Forbrugerklagenævnet).

### 13\. CUSTOMER REVIEWS

In particular (but without limitation), any reviews that the Customer submits through the Platform may not:

* contain any defamatory, obscene or offensive material;
* promote violence or discrimination;
* infringe the intellectual property rights of another person or legal entity;

The Customer will not receive compensation or benefits from making reviews through the Platform.

There may be a delay between the filing of the review and the publishing hereof.

The Customer is informed that in case of inappropriate behaviour towards the Store, the other customers of the Store or TGTG, or if the Customer commits a crime against or in the Store in connection with the Service, or violates the code of conduct rules of the Store or TGTG or any other similar behavior, TGTG may, in particular after complaints made by the Store, ban, exclude or suspend the Customer from the Platform and the Services. The intervention of TGTG does not deprive the Store of the means and rights at its disposal to obtain possible reparations.
