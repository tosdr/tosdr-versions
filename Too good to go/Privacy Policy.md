For Partners or employees of Partners:

We will use some of the personal information collected about you for the purpose of helping us in our continuous efforts to spread the word about food waste. This may entail:

* personalizing, measuring, and improving our advertising,
* analyzing how you and our other Partners use the Platform in order to tailor our promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information,

6.3.1 Targeted advertising

We may ourselves, or with third-party vendors, use your information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you use our Platform or visit other websites. Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information related to our services, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on our App and our services. This form of advertising, sometimes called “targeted advertising,” “behavioral advertising,” or “cross-context behavioral advertising,” enables us and our vendors to know about your interests in connection with the delivery of a specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because it allows you to see advertisements that are relevant to your interests.

6.3.1.1 Supplementary information concerning the USA

We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).

You may opt out of receiving targeted ads from certain data and advertising partners that participate in certain industry self-regulatory programs. The DAA provides a website at [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers) with information about how to opt out of targeted advertising from some or all of the DAA’s participating companies. Additionally, the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) offers a website at [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) where you can opt out of interest-based advertising from some or all of the NAI’s members. Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities.

For targeted advertisements delivered through mobile apps, Users may opt out of certain ads or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings. To learn how to limit ad tracking or to reset the advertising identifier on your iOS and Android device, visit the following links:

* iOS - [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074)
* Android - [https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl%3Den)

You can also install the DAA’s AppChoices app on your device to opt out of targeted advertising by certain providers, and to select system-level advertising preferences on your device (such as “Personalized Ads” on Apple devices, or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” on Android devices).

Finally, to learn more from the NAI about how to opt out of targeted advertising on mobile devices, you can also visit the following link: [https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/](https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out).

6.4 Automated decisions

TGTG uses automated decision-making in using your personal information for some services and products. An example is our fraud prevention and detection efforts on our Platform used to protect our business against fraudulent use of our services and to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of our Platform.

You may request that TGTG provides information about the decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that the automated decision has been made correctly.

We may reject the request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime. However, generally in these circumstances we will verify that the algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias.

### 7\. REASONS WE SHARE INFORMATION

7.1 Sharing with your consent or at your direction

Where you provide consent, we share your information as described at the time of consent, such as when authorising a third-party application or website to link to your TGTG account or participating in promotional activities with TGTG Partners or third parties.

If you have opted-in to marketing cookies on our Platform, we may share your data with third party advertising platforms to increase awareness of our Platform and mission, drive traffic to TGTG, or otherwise promote our Platform as further described in section 6.3 of this Policy and our Cookie Policies for [Users](https://toogoodtogo.com/cookie-policy) and the [Store side of the Platform](https://space-euw1.toogoodtogo.com/cookie-policy), respectively.

7.2 The TGTG group

To support us in providing, promoting and improving the Platform, we may share personal information within our corporate family of companies globally that are related by common ownership or control. When we share data within the TGTG group, we have appropriate contractual as well as technical and organisational security measures in place to protect your personal information in accordance with applicable law.

7.3 Data processors

We may share personal information with service providers to help us run our business and deliver the Platform. These service providers may assist us to fulfil the purposes set out in this Policy, including (but not limited to) by:

* Processing payments for reservations, purchases and refunds on the Platform,
* hosting software functions which enable the functioning and development of our Platform,
* providing hosting services,
* supporting tools for improving the functionality, availability, resilience and security of the Platform,
* performing data analytics,
* providing performance measurements for our ads and campaigns,
* automating SMS, email and ads delivery, such as e.g. sending out newsletters,
* managing our social media and online advertising presence,
* providing integrated tools which helps us deliver customer care services.

Whenever we use a service provider to process personal data on our behalf, we make sure that they are contractually bound to protect your personal information by way of a data processing agreement.

Some of our service providers are established and process your personal information in countries that are not deemed as providing an adequate level of protection of personal data according to the laws of the EU/EEA, Switzerland and the UK. When this is the case, we make sure that your personal information is adequately protected by ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with the applicable law governing the transfer and as further explained in section 8 of this Policy.

We use Google “ReCAPTCHA” on our Website, which allows us to verify that you are not an automated software. To do so, this tool analyses different parameters, such as IP address, device information, and cursor movement patterns, which may lead to the processing of your personal information. ReCAPTCHA features are subject to the then-current versions of Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl%3Den-US) and [Terms of Use](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl%3Den-US).

7.4 Third party geo-location services

We use third party geo-location services, whom we share data with, to provide our Platform and to help us run our business as described below. These third party geo-location services may process personal information for their own purposes as controllers.

If you are a User of our Website we may share your approximate geo-location (city level) (subject to your consent as described in section 4.1) with our third party geo-location service provider, Google.

If you make a purchase in the App, which is available for delivery, we share the specified delivery address with our third party geo-location provider, Google, to validate the delivery address. Our legal basis for sharing this information is our legitimate interest in being able to verify that the specified delivery address is in fact an existing address so that our courier is able to deliver your order.

If you are a user of the Store side of the Platform, we share the address of your Store with our third party geo-location provider, Google, based on our legitimate interest in being able to see where your Store is located on a map for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us in order to:

* provide, improve and develop the Platform
* communicate with you
* provide, tailor, measure, and improve our advertising and marketing.

Google Maps features and content is subject to the then-current versions of the: (1) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at [https://maps.google.com/help/terms\_maps.html](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps); and (2) Google Privacy Policy at [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy). We encourage you to familiarise yourself with these terms before using our Services.

7.5 Franchisors (only relevant for franchisees)

If you are an employee of a franchisee, we may share your name and email address relevant for the Platform with the franchisor.

Our legal basis for sharing this personal information is our and the franchisor’s legitimate interest in being able to manage your franchise chain’s agreement with us and your Store’s presence on the Platform.

7.6 Public authorities

We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, including to the police in connection with criminal investigations, only if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law.

7.7 PR and media agencies

We may share your personal information with third parties such as PR, media and or other types of promotional agencies, if you have consented to participate in our promotional activities or have entered into a contract with us for participation in such promotional activities. Depending on the circumstances these PR and media agencies may be processing personal information as either independent controllers or as processors, processing personal information on our behalf and under our instruction. Where the PR or media agency is processing personal information as data processors, our relationship will be governed by a data processing agreement in accordance with applicable legislation.

7.8 Business transfers

In the event we are involved in a bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, acquisition or reorganisation event, your personal information may be transferred or shared as part of that transaction (e.g., for due diligence purposes) with advisors, counterparties, authorities and other relevant third parties as necessary. This Policy will continue to apply to your information also after the information has been transferred or shared with any new TGTG entity.

7.9 Sharing with other third parties

In order to provide you with our services, we may need to engage third party service providers such as freight carriers or logistics partners, to assist us in fulfilling our contractual obligations and for purposes of our legitimate interest in sending out advertisements. These service providers will have access to personal information solely for the purposes of performing the services on our behalf. We ensure that any third party service providers that we engage are bound by appropriate data protection and confidentiality obligations.

To be clear, these rights are granted only to the extent that you are a California consumer and we are acting as a “business” under the CCPA with respect to your personal information.

2\. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose, or sell or share your personal information, subject to your right to opt out (see personal information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights, below). The information above under Information We Collect; How We Collect It; How We Use It describes the entities with which we may disclose your personal information.

3.RIGHTS TO YOUR INFORMATION

3.1 Right to know

As a California consumer, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale/sharing of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Your Rights, below), and subject to certain limitations that we describe below, we will disclose such information. You have the right to request any or all of the following:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
* The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
* The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
* The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (see Data Portability Rights below).

3.2 Right to delete

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Your Rights, below), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. However, we may retain personal information that has been de-identified or aggregated. Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to perform certain actions set forth under the CCPA, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.

3.3 Right to data portability

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we have collected and maintained about you in the past 12 months. The CCPA allows you to request your information from us up to twice during a 12-month period. We will provide our response in a readily usable (and usually electronic) format.

3.4 Right to correct

You have the right to request the correction of any personal information we maintain about you.

3.5 Right to opt out of selling or sharing your personal information

You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, along with the right to opt in to the sale of such information. We do not sell or share the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is less than 16 (but greater than 13) years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. To our knowledge, we do not sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

To exercise the right to opt out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page: "[Do Not Sell or Share My personal information](https://toogoodtogo.com/privacy-settings)". Alternatively, you may submit an opt-out request by emailing us at [privacy@toogoodtogo.com](mailto:privacy@toogoodtogo.com). We will also treat Global Privacy Control browser signals as valid opt-out requests.

You may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clearing cookies in your browser settings and accept non-essential cookies on our website or by changing your preferences in the account settings of the app.

3.6 Right to limit the use of your sensitive personal information

You have the right to limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information (“SPI”) if we are using your SPI beyond what is reasonable and proportionate to provide the requested goods or services. We do not collect, use or disclose your SPI, other than your precise geolocation for showing you nearby Stores in the App. You can limit our use or disclosure of your precise geolocation by removing our App’s access to your precise geolocation in the settings on your phone or tablet. If you are not a User of the App, we do not knowingly collect your SPI.

3.7 Right to non-discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, including but not limited to, by:

* Denying you goods or services.
* Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.

Or, for App Users:

* Exercise your rights directly in your profile settings in the App. 

After submitting a request, we will take steps to verify your identity in order for us to properly respond and confirm that it is not a fraudulent request. In order to verify your identity, we will ask, at a minimum, that you provide your name, email address, and relationship to us, so that we can seek to match this information with the information existing in our systems. When providing us this information, you represent and affirm that all information provided is true and accurate. Depending on the request, if we are unable to verify that the consumer submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected personal information, we may contact you for more information, or we may not be able to meet your request.

Only you, or an agent legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to your personal information. If you are making a request as the authorized agent of a California consumer, we will ask you also submit reliable proof that you have been authorized in writing by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.

We will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us. If you have a complex request, the CCPA allows us up to 90 days to respond. We will still contact you within 45 days from when you contacted us to let you know we need more time to respond.

4\. NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

We may offer various financial incentives, such as discounts or other benefits to customers from time to time. In particular, from time to time, we may offer you rewards when you create an account or sign up for our services. During the sign-up process and thereafter, we may collect personal information from you, such as identifiers (such as your name and email address), commercial information (such as purchase history and product preferences), inferences drawn about your preferences, and other categories of your personal information. We may use this personal information to tailor your experience and our communications to you based on products and services we think may be of interest to you, and for measurement and analytics. We believe that the benefits you receive from signing up for our services, including any rewards we may offer, are reasonably related to the value of your personal information.

You can opt into a financial incentive by following the applicable sign-up or participation instructions provided, and, for any ongoing benefits, you can opt-out at any time by following the unsubscribe or opt-out instructions for the applicable program or contacting us at [privacy@toogoodtogo.com](mailto:privacy@toogoodtogo.com).

To request the above information, please contact us by email at [privacy@toogoodtogo.com](mailto:privacy@toogoodtogo.com).

### SCHEDULE 2 - VIRGINIA/COLORADO/CONNECTICUT AND SIMILAR U.S. STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS

The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act and similar laws in other U.S. states (“State Privacy Laws”) provide their consumers with specific rights regarding their personal data. To the extent that you are a resident of one of these states, this section describes your rights under the State Privacy Laws and explains how you may exercise these rights.

The categories of personal data we process, our purposes for processing your personal data, the categories of personal data that we share with third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom we share it are set forth in the terms of the Policy above.

1\. RIGHTS TO YOUR INFORMATION

In addition to the rights set forth in our Policy, the State Privacy Laws provide you with the following rights:

* Right to know. You have the right to know whether we process your personal data and to access such personal data.
* Right to data portability. You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data that you previously provided to us in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the data to another business without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means. You may request such personal data up to twice annually, subject to certain exceptions.
* Right to delete. You have the right to delete personal data that you have provided by or that we have obtained about you. Please note that we may deny such request if the requested deletion falls under an exception as set forth in the State Privacy Laws. Additionally, if you request deletion of your personal data and we have obtained such information from a third-party source, we may retain such data by keeping a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary to ensure that your personal data remains deleted from our records and that such retained data is not used for any other purpose, or we may opt you out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those allowed under the State Privacy Laws.
* Right to opt out. You have the right to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of: (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of personal data; or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you. As of the latest date of the Policy:
* We DO process personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;
* We DO NOT sell your personal data for monetary or other valuable consideration (while we do share your personal data with third parties for purposes of targeted advertising, we do not believe this constitutes a “sale” under State Privacy Laws); and
* We DO NOT engage in profiling decisions based on your personal data that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning you.
* Right to correct. You have the right to correct inaccuracies in your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes for which we process it.
* Right to nondiscrimination. You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights. Unless permitted by the State Privacy Laws, we will not:
* Deny you goods or services;
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

2\. HOW TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS

2.1 Verifying your identity

To exercise any of your privacy rights, or if you have any questions about your privacy rights, you may contact us by:

* Emailing us at [privacy@toogoodtogo.com](mailto:privacy@toogoodtogo.com)
* Visiting our privacy rights page at [https://space.toogoodtogo.com/privacy](https://space.toogoodtogo.com/privacy)

After submitting a request, we will take steps to verify your identity in order for us to properly respond and/or confirm that your request is not fraudulent. We may contact you for additional information as reasonably necessary to authenticate your request, but if we are ultimately unable to authenticate your request using reasonably commercial efforts, then we may not be able to comply with it.

Only you or your authorized agent may make a verifiable request related to your personal data. If you are making a request as the parent or legal guardian of a known child regarding the processing of that child’s personal data, we may ask you to submit reliable proof of your identity.

3\. RESPONSE TIME

3.1 Your right to appeal

We will make every effort to respond to your request within 45 days from when you contacted us. If you have a complex request, the State Privacy Laws allow us up to 90 days to respond. We will contact you within 45 days from when you contacted us to inform you of the need for additional time and the reason for such extension. We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover administrative costs if your requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.

If we decline to take action on a request that you have submitted, we will inform you of our reasons for doing so, and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision. You will have the right to appeal within a reasonable period of time after you have received our decision. Within 60 days (45 days for residents of Colorado) of our receipt of your appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If we deny your appeal, we will provide you with a method for contacting your state attorney general’s office to submit a complaint.
