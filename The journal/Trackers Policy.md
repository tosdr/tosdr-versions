**Website Analytics and Performance Cookies**

We use Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors engage with our Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies to store non-personally identifiable information. You can find out more in [Analytics cookies and privacy information.](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage?hl=en-GB)

**Personalised Advertising and Targeting Cookies**

Personalisation of ads improves the relevance of the adverts you see and the value these ads create for advertisers. This helps fund our Sites, keeping our free services. We can not identify you from personalising ads.

Advertisers may use third parties’ technology to target an ad. These third parties may use information they collected from your use of other websites to create an ad profile that informs the ads they show you.

If you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by advertisers, you can manage your preferences by going to [https://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/).

If you want to switch off all advertising targeting cookies you can do that from our Cookies Preference Centre by clicking the "Cookie preferences" button above.

**Subscription Cookies**

Piano Software Inc, provide subscription, payment, identity management and analytics services to us, for the purpose of content monetisation.

Some of the personal data it collects is in order to provide a seamless but secure purchasing environment. No data is sold to third parties and it is processed solely for the provision of the service.

You can see a full listing of the Subscription Cookies by clicking the "Cookie preferences" button above and looking at the listings under “Necessary Cookies”.

**Controlling individual cookies**

You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish through your browser. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.

You can manage your cookies preferences directly in individual browsers here:

* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
* [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)

* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac)

If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.

You can learn in greater detail about cookies and how to manage them here:

[https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies)

**Local Storage**

LocalStorage is another common way to save data, similar to cookies, but the data is not automatically sent to the website server by the user's browser.

Data stored locally has no expiration date and will exist until the browser cache is manually cleared. On your PC, if you are using Internet Explorer, Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox you can quickly clear your cache with a keyboard shortcut. While in your browser, press Ctrl + Shift + Delete simultaneously on the keyboard to open the appropriate window. On MacOS the shortcut is Command + Shift + Delete.

We utilise local storage in a single case as soon as the user opens the website. A BugSnag anonymous ID is persisted in local storage to capture and log errors on the website that need to be addressed.

### Privacy

Journal Media Limited is committed to protecting your Personal Data. This Privacy Notice applies to your use of the websites and applications: TheJournal.ie, The 42, Noteworthy.ie, Factchecking.ie (each, a “Site”) and sets out how we collect, use and protect your personal data. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Notice, please do not use the Sites.

We comply with Data Protection Law and this Notice applies to the personal data collected, processed and stored by us through your use of a Site. Under Data Protection Law, personal data is information that identifies you as an individual or is capable of doing so.

For the purposes of Data Protection Law, we are the data controller of your Personal Data. You will find our contact details in the “Contact us” section below.

**How we gather data and Personal Data**

We gather data from your use of a Site for example through the use of cookies. We are not able to identify you from this data. You can find out how we use cookies and how to change your preferences by clicking the “Cookie Preference Centre” button above.

We gather Personal Data when you have logged in with a social media account or when you have provided us with Personal Data for example by contacting us via email or through the Site.

**What kinds of Personal Data do we collect?**

We receive and store information you enter on a Site or give us in any other way, including when registering for a commenting account, installing an application, subscribing to a mailing list, making a purchase, as well as provided in your comments and requests.

If, during your use of a Site, you log in with your social media account we will collect your social media account details as well as the name and e-mail address associated to that social media account (if available).

If, during your use of a Site, you post comments, we will keep a record of your commenting history.

The Sites create a user profile when you install an application. We will collect or process data you provide to us in the course of creating or updating a user profile. This information will vary but typically includes your device ID, the versions of our apps you have installed on your device, your reading interests in our Sites.

Our Sites offer location based features. When you enable these features we ask for your permission to access location data. We do not track your location.

If, during your use of a Site, you sign up to notifications or e-mail newsletters, we will also collect your preferences.

If you purchase goods we will collect your shipping address, order contact, payment method and purchase history.

**Legal basis for processing**

Given the varied functionality of each Site we rely on the following legal bases under Data Protection Law in processing your Personal Data:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Legal Basis | Example |
| Performance of a contract | We will process your Personal Data to the extent required to deliver the service requested. |
| Compliance with legal obligations | We may need to disclose Personal Data to comply with a request from law enforcement, or other government agencies or court order. |
| Legitimate interests | We may need to disclose Personal Data in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any comment or content posted by that user. |

**How we may use your Personal Data**

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Notice, we will not disclose Personal Data that we collect to any parties other than those with whom we partner or are affiliated with, without your consent. Except as disclosed below, we will not sell, share, trade, rent, or give away your Personal Data.

We may use your Personal Data to process any requests made by you for example, to create a user account, subscribe to a mailing list or make a complaint about a comment/post, respond to your inquiry, and communicate with you when necessary to provide customer service and/or follow-up information related to the Site. We may also use information you provide to communicate with you about your interest in our events and our company, to help us improve, operate and enhance your experience on a Site, to promote our events, notify you about important functionality changes to a Site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable, to tailor advertisements, content, and other aspects of your experience on and in connection with a Site, for other administrative purposes, to prevent or detect abuses of our terms of use, and to enable third-parties to carry out technical or other functions on our behalf as well as any other purpose that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request your Personal Data. We may combine non-personal information that you provide with supplemental information (including mailing address updates and demographic data) that we obtain from public sources or reputable third-parties. Information combined with personally identifiable information becomes, and is treated as, Personal Data under this Privacy Notice.

When you contact us, we may request your affirmative, positive consent to use your contact information for marketing or other business purposes.

If you are a member of a social media platform or website, and log in to such social media or platform, the interfaces may allow the social media platform or website to connect your visit to a Site to your Personal Data. The social media plugins also may allow the social media website to share information about your activities on a Site with other users of their social media platform. We have no control over the information that other websites or social media websites or plugins collect, store, or use. Before you choose to access other websites from a Site or “like” or share information from a Site through any social media platform or website, please be certain that you review the privacy notice of that social media platform or website.

**Do we disclose Personal Data to anyone else?**

We disclose customer information to third parties only when it is necessary as part of business practices or when there is a legal or statutory obligation to do so. Whenever we disclose customer information to third parties, we will only disclose that amount of information necessary to meet such business need or legal requirement. Third parties that receive customer information from us must satisfy us as to the measures taken to protect the personal data such parties receive, in accordance with Data Protection Law and as stated in this Privacy Notice. Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that all such disclosures or transfers of customer information to third parties will be completed in a secure manner and pursuant to contractual safeguards.

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, including processing credit card payments, marketing, and providing analytics assistance. From time to time, we may also share Personal Data or non-personally identifiable information with third-parties that we have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of certain aspects of a Site, including to customise, deliver, measure, analyse, improve and support our services, content, advertising and layout, your interaction with those aspects, and to deliver more relevant messages and advertisements to you.
