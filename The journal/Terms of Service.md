Terms of Use
============

**1\. Introduction**

Thank you for visiting our websites (TheJournal.ie, The 42, Noteworthy and Factchecking.ie websites and applications)(each a “Site” and together “our Sites”)) owned and operated by Journal Media (references in these Terms of Use to ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ are references to Journal Media Limited). Please read these terms of use (the “Terms of Use”) carefully as they constitute a binding legal agreement between you and us in relation to your use of the Sites.

By viewing any of our Sites whether it be via a web browser, our mobile phone application, Twitter, Facebook, e-mail or any other platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree then you must not use any of our Sites.

**2\. Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. Please read our [Privacy Notice](https://www.thejournal.ie/cookies-privacy-policy/) to see how we collect, use and protect your personal information. We recommend that you do this before using any of our Sites.

**3\. Changes to Terms of Use**

We may change, modify, add to or delete portions of these Terms of Use at any time. When we do, we will notify you of the changes by adding an “updated” icon next to the Terms of Use link on the front page of the Sites for two weeks from the date of the change. However it is your responsibility to regularly review the Terms of Use for changes. By continuing to use any of our Sites you will be deemed to have read, understood and agreed to be bound by these changes.

**4\. Your use of our Sites**

Our Sites are made available for your personal, non-commercial use only, except where otherwise authorised by us.

It is your responsibility, bearing in mind the global nature of the internet, to comply with all relevant laws which may apply to your use of our Sites and to the material you post, including but not limited to laws relating to acceptable content, online conduct and the export of data.

Failure to comply with all applicable laws or these Terms of Use may result in deletion of posts, suspension of posting privileges and/or banning.

**(i) Your Account**

If you register an account then as part of the registration process you may be asked to select a user name and password. You are responsible for all activities occurring under your username and for keeping your password secure. We strongly recommend you do not reuse a password which you also use elsewhere.

You may not select or use a username that:

1. Contains the name of any Site or otherwise misrepresents your relationship with any Site or any other party;
2. Contains any profanity, is vulgar or offensive, or promotes an illegal activity;
3. Violates any trade mark or other proprietary right; or
4. Impersonates someone else.

We reserve the rights to change usernames at our discretion.

We reserve the right to log off or deactivate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time.

You may not use the account or password of another user and must not disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorised use of your account or access to your password.

We shall not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using or accessing your password or account, either with or without your knowledge.

You may be held liable for losses incurred by us or any other party as a result of someone else using or accessing your password or account if you have not taken reasonable steps to keep your password or account secure.

We may at our absolute discretion refuse you access to any Site, delete posts by you or suspend/terminate your account without prior notice for any reason and you shall not be entitled to any compensation in respect of this.

These Terms of Use, including, in particular, the indemnities contained herein, shall survive any suspension or termination of your account.

**(ii) Your Posts**

We are committed to providing an open forum for discussion and debate on stories in the news. Each Site has a comments section available to its users to facilitate such discussion and debate. Please note that you are liable for the contents of any comments you post on any of our Sites. We shall not be liable whatsoever for any comments posted by you or any other user. Any views or comments expressed in the user posts are not necessarily the views of Journal Media, any entity associated with us or any of our Sites’ editorial team. We strongly advise that you read our separate [Comments Policy](https://www.thejournal.ie/comments-policy/) before posting any comments on our Sites.

It is our policy not to allow users post comments anonymously and we therefore require users to log-in using a Twitter of Facebook account (a “Social Media Account”) to make a post in order to ensure that comments are attributable to a user.  By logging-in with a Social Media Account you warrant and represent that you are the owner of the Social Media Account and that you are the person identifiable by that Social Media Account. You may not use the Social Media Account of another person or otherwise assume a false identity for the purposes of posting a comment on our Sites.

We are not responsible for and do not endorse the contents of users’ posts or warrant the accuracy, truthfulness, legality or reliability of user’s posts. You are entirely responsible for material which you post on our Sites and shall indemnify in accordance with section 13 of these Terms of Use.

We expect you to act responsibly in posting comments. You agree, through use of this service, not to post any material which:

1. Violates the criminal law;
2. Promotes or encourages illegal activity;
3. Is defamatory, invasive of privacy, abusive, harassing, threatening, profane, violent, sexually explicit, or which otherwise violates the rights of others;
4. May prejudice ongoing civil or criminal proceedings, violate the sub judice rule or may otherwise amount to a contempt of court;
5. Infringes the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, database right, right of privacy or publicity or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any person;
6. Includes any spam, unauthorised advertising or any other form of commercial publicity;
7. Is irrelevant, repetitive or imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our servers, bandwidth or infrastructure;
8. Falsely claims to be sponsored or endorsed by us; or
9. Contains any virus or similar harmful and/or disruptive material.

Due to the real-time nature of our Sites, we cannot and are not required to review the contents of posted comments, nor do we confirm the validity of information submitted. We do not actively monitor user comments and we are not responsible for and give no warranty or make any representation in relation to any user comments. If you deem any comments offensive or objectionable, please bring these to our attention by identifying the specific material that you consider objectionable. You can do this by clicking  ‘report this comment’. You will be asked to give your reasons for wanting the comment removed.

Whilst we do not monitor comments, we reserve the right to take down material that comes to our attention via a complaint or otherwise. Commenters who repeatedly flout our [Comments Policy](https://www.thejournal.ie/comments-policy/) or these Terms of Use will be barred from joining discussions on our Sites. This operates on a “three-strikes-and-you’re-out basis”: if we have to remove three comments posted by you, you will be blacklisted. You will not necessarily be notified when comments are removed. We will not enter into any correspondence with or about users who have been blacklisted.

We reserve the right to immediately ban a user if there has been a serious breach of the [Comments Policy](https://www.thejournal.ie/comments-policy/) or these Terms of Use. All decisions in relation to these matters are carried out at our sole discretion.

We reserve the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any comment or content posted by you.

By posting any material on any Site, you grant us a licence to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such material. The licence you grant to us is non-exclusive, royalty free and fully paid up, sub-licensable, and worldwide. You also waive to the fullest extent permissible by law any moral rights in such material. You are responsible for making sure that you have all rights to what you post, including the rights necessary for you to grant the licence above.

By posting any material on any Site you represent and warrant that: (i) you own the material posted by you or otherwise have the right to grant the licence above, and (ii) the posting of the material does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any other rights of any person. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, or any other monies owing any person by reason of any material posted by you.
