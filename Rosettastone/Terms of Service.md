14\. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE

You agree that: (i) the Website shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Website shall be

deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in

jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the

State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this

Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences

with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall

be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). This Agreement is a contract for the

provision of services and not a contract for the sale of goods. The provisions of the Uniform Commercial

Code (UCC), the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA), or any substantially similar

legislation as may be enacted, shall not apply to this Agreement. If you are located outside of the territory of

the United States, the parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

Sale of Goods shall not govern this Agreement or the rights and obligations of the parties under this

Agreement.



You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Mateo County,

California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court

of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of

our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set

forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable

harm. You agree that San Mateo County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration

award or for trial court proceedings if the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.



15\. ARBITRATION

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE

THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM

ROSETTA STONE. For any dispute with Rosetta Stone, you agree to first contact us at

legalnotices@ixl.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that

Rosetta Stone has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to

resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as

provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this agreement, or the breach or alleged

breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited

Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at

www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in San Mateo County, California, unless you and

Rosetta Stone agree otherwise. If you are an individual using the Website for non-commercial purposes: (i)

JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully

obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of

arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and

(iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but

this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any

judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Rosetta Stone from seeking injunctive or other

equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,

misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.



16\. CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER

WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE

OBTAINED OR USED THE WEBSITE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES,

ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A

PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION,

PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS

WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE

ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE

THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ROSETTA STONE ARE EACH

WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,

COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE

PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.



17\. GENERAL

a) Entire Agreement. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Rosetta Stone

and governs your use of the Website, superseding any prior agreements between you and Rosetta

Stone with respect to the Website. You will be subject to additional terms and conditions that will

apply when you use or purchase Rosetta Stone services and products.

b) Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Rosetta Stone to exercise or enforce any right or

provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of

the Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless

agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the

provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.

c) Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or

cause of action arising out of or related to the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such

claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
