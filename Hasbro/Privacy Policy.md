WELCOME!

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Hasbro, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies that operate within the United States (collectively, "Hasbro", “we”, “our”, or “us”) collect, use and disclose your information when you visit our websites. This Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites and other online products and services where this Policy is posted (collectively, the “Services”) or interact with us offline regarding the Services.

As a licensee of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our Services and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB. If you are a California resident, please see the [“Additional disclosures for California residents”](https://docs.hasbro.com/en-us/legal/privacy#H) section below.

**2\. What information is collected from me?**

**Information That You Provide**

Hasbro may collect information that you provide when you use the Services, such as when you:

(1) send questions or comments via email or live chat to Hasbro customer support;  
(2) fill out online surveys;  
(3) sign up for our newsletter or other email alerts;  
(4) share a website with a friend;  
(5) share a news release through our investor website;  
(6) provide information necessary to obtain parental consent; or  
(7) otherwise communicate with us through the Services.

Depending on the activity, the types of personal information that we or our service providers collect, including in the last 12 months, may include:

(1) your first and/or last name;  
(2) email address  
(3) telephone number;  
(4) address (including billing address and/or shipping address); and  
(5) other contact or identifying information that you choose to provide.

In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you refer someone to our Services (including promotions). We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your requests, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us. If you provide us with information regarding another individual, you represent that you have that person’s consent to give us his or her information and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this policy.

**Information We Collect Automatically From You.**

When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about your visit (collectively, “Online User Activity”). When you visit our websites, the personal information we collect is your computer's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which we use for the support of our internal operations. Other information we and our service providers may collect includes your operating system, access times, browser type and language, country, and the URL of the website you visited before navigating to our Services. If you access our Services via a mobile device, we may also collect your device make and model, mobile carrier, operating system version, language your device is set to, mobile web browser type and version, the country in which you are using your device, and non-personal analytics and statistical data regarding use of the websites (e.g., downloads, number of users, sessions, frequency of use, retention, territories, and in-game events).

To collect this Online User Activity, we use various technologies, including the following:

* **Cookies:** Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. In addition, when you view a video on our Services, we may set a "flash cookie" (sometimes called a "flash object") on your computer or device. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see ["What are my information choices?"](#F) below.
* **Clear GIFs:** Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.
* **Log Files:** Log files record website activity on our Services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have accessed or used our Services, which pages of our Services they've visited, and other similar data.
* **Do Not Track (DNT) Signals:** Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your personal information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may associate the information we collect from these technologies with other personal information that you provide for the purposes described in this Policy.

**Information We Collect from Other Sources**

We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you connect with us on a social media service or log into a Hasbro account using a third-party “social sign on”, we may have access to certain information from that party, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.

**Third-Party Website Technology and Analytics**

Third party technologies include analytics services and software to help us understand how users access and use the Services. These tools and services use cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies on our Services to track website traffic and performance. The data collected typically includes Online User Activity such as IP address, Internet Service Provider, web browser, the time spent on web pages, the links clicked and the products or advertisements viewed on various pages. We use this information to improve our Services and your experience, to see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and to count visits.

* Operate and improve our Services, including by linking or combining your information with other information we get from third parties;
* Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and provide administrative messages, such as changes to this Privacy Policy or our Terms;

**4\. How does Hasbro handle children’s information?**

**NOTE TO PARENTS**

Hasbro has developed its Services to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages, including those under 13 (“Child(ren)”). Please discuss this Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Services. Hasbro believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Services will inform choices and decisions about how to use the Services and will better protect its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this section.

Hasbro is committed to compliance with the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)](http://www.esrb.org/privacy/faq.aspx#12), a federal law designed to protect Children online. We take Children's privacy seriously and encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their Children's privacy and online experience at all times. As shown on our website, we are Privacy Certified by ESRB for Kids, which indicates that our Services were subject to a third party review to ensure they restrict the collection and use of personal information in compliance with COPPA.

**Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information**

Hasbro may collect and store certain persistent identifiers (e.g., cookies, IP addresses, etc.) from Children without parental consent for the purpose of supporting the internal operations of the Services or as otherwise permitted under COPPA.

Hasbro may collect and store other personal information about Children if this information is submitted by a Child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child. If a Service is directed to children under COPPA, we may ask users to verify their dates of birth before collecting any personal information from them. Those users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process.

Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a Child when submitted by a Child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child: first and/or last name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect the Child's mailing address and/or telephone number when necessary to respond to an inquiry or fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a Child such as the Child's date of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences, and combine such information with the Child's personal information. Please refer to the sections entitled ["What information is collected from me?"](#B) and [“How does Hasbro use my information?”](#C) for further details on the information we collect and the tools we use to collect it.

When registering an account to play online games, we may collect a username and password from registrants for the purpose of saving that user’s gaming activities (e.g., pets collected in Littlest Pet Shop). Once collected, we may also use the game play information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors in order to better meet their needs, or as otherwise described in this Policy. Please note that we use aggregated (i.e., non-personal) information for analytics purposes.

Additionally, we are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a Child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the Child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the Child's phone number) to allow the Child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it, even with parental consent. To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all users’ personal information, please see our section on ["Security"](#G).

**Disclosure of Children's Personal Information**

We follow our standard policy [("With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?")](#E) for the disclosure of personal information collected from and about Children.

**Parental Access**

A parent who has already given Hasbro permission to collect and use his or her Child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or delete the Child's personal information; and/or (2) discontinue further collection or use of the Child's personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact [Hasbro Consumer Care](http://corporate.hasbro.com/en-us/consumer-care). Please be sure to include your Child's name and email address, your name and email address, and the name of the site on which your Child is registered. Alternatively, you may contact us at:

Hasbro, Inc.  
Attention: Website Administrator  
1027 Newport Avenue, Mailstop A906

**5\. With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?**

**Social Sharing Features**

The Services may offer third party social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook widget), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides these features. The third party provider may also collect other information in connection with your use of their features, including your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.

**Linking to Third Party Sites**

To provide relevant information not found on our Services, to facilitate online shopping, and to allow you to interact with other websites and/or applications in which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites), Hasbro may provide links to or embed third-party applications that allow login from our Services to third party websites. Your use of these third party websites and/or applications is subject to the third parties' privacy policies and terms of use, and we encourage you to read the third parties' privacy policies and terms of use before submitting personal or other information or using the websites and/or applications.

[Back to top](#top)

**7\. Security and Retention**

Hasbro has established a security program with administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction. For example, Hasbro strives to provide only those employees performing a legitimate business function with access to users’ personal information. Hasbro also reviews its security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.

Hasbro retains your information based on a number of factors, including (i) for business purposes such as for as long as your account is active, as long as is reasonably necessary to provide you with our products and services, and for the other purposes we use your information as described above, and (ii) as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a reasonable period of time.

Despite our efforts, please be aware that no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. To that end, Hasbro will notify users of a data breach when Hasbro determines that is reasonably necessary in accordance with applicable law, and you agree to receive such notice via email where possible.
