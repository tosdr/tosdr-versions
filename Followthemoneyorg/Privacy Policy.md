#### We merged to form OpenSecrets!

The National Institute on Money in Politics and the Center for Responsive Politics joined forces to become OpenSecrets.

This website displays state campaign finance data that is current through the 2024 election year. While the data is current, the site isn't maintained as we integrate with OpenSecrets and you may find bugs.  
You can find our federal data at [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/?utm_source=ftm).
