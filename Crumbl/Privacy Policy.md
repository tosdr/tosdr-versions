We collect your information when you interact with us directly, including when you:

* access, navigate, and create an account on our Sites;
* purchase our Products;
* engage in Communications with us, including via our customer service team online;
* visit our Stores;
* participate in a promotion, such as a sweepstakes or contest;
* post a tagged photo or other content on a third party social network;
* post a Product review, question, answer, or other information on the Sites;
* or otherwise interact with us.

The information we collect when you interact with us directly includes:

* **Contact Information**, such as your first and last name, mailing address, delivery address, email address, and telephone number.
* **Account Credentials**, such as your username, password, password hints, and information used for authentication and account access.
* **Demographic Information**, such as your age, gender, zip code, and country.
* **Billing Information**, such as your payment information (e.g., credit or debit card number), expiration date, security code, bank account information, or other financial information relating to your purchase of our Products.
* **Profile Information**, such as your interests, preferences, shopping lists, email preferences, purchasing history, and favorites.
* **Communications**, such as any messages you send to us through feedback and questions to customer support, information you publicly post on our Sites or other websites (such as product reviews or blog comments), e-mail messages, and recordings of telephone calls with customer service or other First Leaf representatives.

**Information we automatically collect from you**

When you interact with our Sites, Products, and Communications, we automatically receive certain information about you from your devices and browsers, including:

* **Usage Information.** Information such as the features you use on our Sites, the links you click and the items you view, pages you visit, emails and advertisements you view, Products you view and purchase, the time of day you browse, and your referring and exiting pages. From time to time, this information may be collected through the use of first and third-party cookies such as though engaging in what’s commonly known as “session replay” cookies, and payment providers such as Stripe.
* **Device Information.** Information about the device you are using, including but not limited to the type of device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifier (UDID) placed by us or our service providers, the IP address of your device, the MAC address, advertiser ID, your operating system, the type of browser you use, and data from the way you use our Sites. From time to time, this information may be collected through the use of first and third-party cookies such as though engaging in what’s commonly known as “session replay”, and payment providers such as Stripe.
* **Location Data.** Information such as imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level). Our Sites may also collect information about the location of your device. We and our service providers may use this approximate location along with other information submitted by you, to provide you with location-based services like local Store information, search results, special offers, and other personalized content.
* **Cookies.** Cookies are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies on our Sites: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Sites and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Sites. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.
* **Pixels (also known as web beacons).** This is a type of code that is embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us to track our communications, bring you advertising both on and off the Sites, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Sites with your social media account.
* **App Technologies.** Information concerning technologies included in our mobile applications and Sites that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our Sites may include SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server. These SDKs allow us to track our Communications, bring you advertising both on and off the Sites, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Sites with your social media account.

**Internet-based advertising / Do Not Track**

We may, from time to time, collect information about users over time and across different websites when you use this Sites. Our third-party partners may also collect information in this manner. For example, we may use one or more third-party online advertising networks to serve ads on our behalf on third-party websites. The third-party ad network may collect information about your visits to our Sites and your interaction with our online ads. This is primarily accomplished using technology such as cookies, action tags, web beacons, and/or GIF tags which are placed in various places within our Sites and our online ads. Some browsers have a 'do not track' feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so our Site is not currently designed to respond to those signals unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.

**Social media widgets and single sign on services**

Our Sites use third-party social media widgets. Such third-party features may collect information about you, like your IP address and the page(s) you visit on our Sites. They may also place cookies on your device. These social media widgets are either hosted by a Third Party or by our Sites. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the third-party social media networks that provide them.

This Site is directed to adults, and does not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent.
