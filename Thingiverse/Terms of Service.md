Such Third-Party Sites & Ads are not under the control of the Company and the Company is not responsible for any Third-Party Sites & Ads. The Company provides these Third-Party Sites & Ads only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third Party Sites & Ads. You use all Third-Party Sites & Ads at your own risk. When you link to a Third-Party Site & Ad, the applicable third party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Sites & Ads.

Your interactions and transactions with other Users are solely between you and such User.

You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available through such Application. The Applications may be subject to third party terms and policies, including privacy and data collection practices and it is your responsibility to review all such terms and policies.

6.3.2 User Content. Company has implemented measures on certain User Content licensed under specific secondary licenses from being accessible through Applications. These measures mean that, subject to the terms of the secondary license that you selected as referenced in Section 4.1 above, you either: 1) need to provide your express permission in sharing User Content through Applications; or 2) you may automatically be opted into having that content be accessible through Applications. You may opt-out of sharing your User Content under 2) above by: a) revoking permission to the Application as specified on the Site; and/or b) choosing a different license. For secondary licenses for which you are not automatically opted-in, you may give permission to make your applicable User Content available through the Application by: a) granting permission to the Application as specified on the Sites; and/or b) choosing an appropriate alternative license. User permission will override the license. A User is responsible for the license they choose for his or her User Content. Regardless of such measures, the Company cannot guarantee that your secondary license will in fact be observed by the Applications. For all Applications, you are solely responsible for ensuring that their Applications comply with the secondary licenses. If you think a Developer is breaching your secondary license, please contact the Developer or Company.

6.3.3 Tipping. If you make your User Content available under Section 6.3.2 above, you may be able to make Tips (as described and defined in more detail in the User-to-User Payment Terms.

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

12.2 Governing Law and Venue. These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
