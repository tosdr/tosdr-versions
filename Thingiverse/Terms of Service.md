Such Third-Party Sites & Ads are not under the control of the Company and the Company is not responsible for any Third-Party Sites & Ads. The Company provides these Third-Party Sites & Ads only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third Party Sites & Ads. You use all Third-Party Sites & Ads at your own risk.

You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available through such Application. The Applications may be subject to third party terms and policies, including privacy and data collection practices and it is your responsibility to review all such terms and policies.

6.3.2 User Content. Company has implemented measures on certain User Content licensed under specific secondary licenses from being accessible through Applications. These measures mean that, subject to the terms of the secondary license that you selected as referenced in Section 4.1 above, you either: 1) need to provide your express permission in sharing User Content through Applications; or 2) you may automatically be opted into having that content be accessible through Applications. You may opt-out of sharing your User Content under 2) above by: a) revoking permission to the Application as specified on the Site; and/or b) choosing a different license. For secondary licenses for which you are not automatically opted-in, you may give permission to make your applicable User Content available through the Application by: a) granting permission to the Application as specified on the Sites; and/or b) choosing an appropriate alternative license. User permission will override the license. A User is responsible for the license they choose for his or her User Content. Regardless of such measures, the Company cannot guarantee that your secondary license will in fact be observed by the Applications. For all Applications, you are solely responsible for ensuring that their Applications comply with the secondary licenses. If you think a Developer is breaching your secondary license, please contact the Developer or Company.

6.3.3 Tipping. If you make your User Content available under Section 6.3.2 above, you may be able to make Tips (as described and defined in more detail in the User-to-User Payment Terms.

IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

Continued use of our Sites or Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.

12.2 Governing Law and Venue. These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Any action or proceeding relating to a claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of or relates to these Terms of Use or the Sites or Services (a “Claim“) must be brought in a federal or state court located in New York, New York, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding, unless such claim is submitted to arbitration as set forth below.

12.3 Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use, and any supplemental terms, policies, and guidelines incorporated herein, including, but not limited to the MakerBot Terms of Sale, MakerBot Privacy Policy, and related Company End-User License agreements, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Sites and Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. If any provision of these Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to the Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms of Use, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without the Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
