In the event that an Organization purchases a subscription to the Services, they will have access to aggregate reporting relating to usage of the Services by Users and other related analytics associated with their Organization. By default, Organizations will not have access to the content of Notes or Feedback Messages of Users who create this content.

Children under 13
-----------------

Fellow does not knowingly offer its Services to children who are under 13 years of age. If we become aware of usage of its services by individuals in this age group, we will attempt to delete all related information immediately.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance
----------------------------------------------------

For residents of the European Economic Area, Fellow generally processes Personal Data in order to fulfill contracts we have with the Organizations that are our customers and Users, as well as to pursue our legitimate business interests as set out in this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, Fellow will obtain consent from an Individual User in respect of processing of Personal Data.

When we process data on behalf of Organizations under an agreement with that Organization, Fellow is acting as the “data processor” and the Organization is the “data controller”.

Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) have certain data protection rights under applicable laws (including under the GDPR), including the right to request access to, obtain, correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your personal data. Individual Users who wish to exercise these rights, should contact Fellow using the contact information. In circumstances where Fellow is a data processor and the Organization is the data controller, Individuals may be required to contact the Organization to avail themselves of such rights.

Information collected from Users will be processed by us and some of our affiliate services and service providers (“Sub-Processors”). A list of our current Sub-Processors is available [**here**](https://www.fellow.app/fellow-app-sub-processors/). We will take reasonably necessary steps, including contractual measures and other legal requirements, to ensure that your Personal Data is dealt with the same level of caution and care as described in this Privacy Policy.

Data transferred from the European Economic Area to Fellow or a Sub-Processor shall be in accordance with approved international transfer mechanisms under applicable law.

Security
--------

We take security seriously and use appropriate technical measures corresponding to the types of Personal Data we store, and the risks associated with processing such data. In the event of a data breach we will contact those affected as well as any applicable regulators as required by law. You can learn more about Fellow’s security and compliance practices [**here**](https://help.fellow.app/en/articles/4302231-security-compliance).

Types of Data We Collect
------------------------

When using our Services, we collect information from you – some of which is considered “Personal Data” and can be used to identify you, and some of which is “Anonymous Data” which is not linked to any identifiable individual. In the following sections, we will outline the details of what we collect and how:

### Information You Provide

When you sign up, we create an account for you on our servers (“Account”) to access our Services. We will store information such as your first name, last name, job title, department and email address.

Fellow’s primary objective is to help you manage your work relationships through the logging of discussions, feedback, goals/priorities and more with others that you work with (whether individually or in groups). Fellow also offers smart suggestions on what actions you may want to take in order to optimize these relationships (for example, “you should [ask for feedback](https://fellow.app/blog/feedback/how-to-ask-for-feedback-in-a-professional-setting/) from someone in particular”). In order to provide such suggestions, we need to compute a “work-graph” that will give us insights into the people that you work with and how often you work with them. In order to offer these Services, we require access to the following information:

* Calendar: We access data about the events that you participate in such as organizer, title, attendees and optional attendees (names and emails), date, time, duration, calendar resources (meeting rooms) and recurrence of events.

Once you sign up, we may ask you more information including your job title, department, who your manager is and whether you have a 1on1 with this manager and which calendar event this corresponds to. We also provide the opportunity for you to invite other individuals into the platform so that you may collaborate with them (in order to invite others, we may ask you for some further information about those Users including their name, email address and reporting relationship with you).

Your main interactions with Fellow will either directly through our Platform, one of our communications platform apps, or via one of our integrations.. Users on the system will be able to collaborate on notes in relation to 1:1 and group meetings, goals/priorities and request feedback from one another and provide feedback to each other. The content created by these Users will be stored and accessible through the Services. This information is by default only accessible to Users who were part of the interactions and is not accessible by managers of the company (unless those that were part of the feedback interactions explicitly share such feedback with others such as managers). Metadata about the interactions (such as stats on usage) will be available to managers. The only exception to this rule will be if the policies of the Organization require us to share this information upon request from the Organization.

### Information Collected through Systems

#### Servers

Our servers (hosted by Amazon Web Services) collect information including the type of browser and O/S you use, your IP Address, domain name and the timing / duration of your visit to our Site. This information is collected to make our Services more useful to you.

#### Logs

We record some information from your interactions with our Services automatically in our logs. This data includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information is used to analyze trends and usage patterns all in an effort to better tailor our Services to your needs.

#### Cookies

Fellow and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track Users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Fellow Services when you visit. Fellow keeps track of the pages you visit within Fellow, in order to determine what portion of the Fellow Services is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the Fellow Services to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

#### Pixel Tags

We use “Clear Gifs” also known as “Pixel Tags” similar to cookies to track the usage of our Services by Users. These “Clear Gifs” are effectively transparent images that allow us to glean some information about said usage. An example common use case is to use this technology to understand the open-rate of emails that we send to you. Ultimately, like cookies, we use this tool as another method to customize our offerings for our customers.

#### Analytics Software and Advertising Platforms

We use some analytics services from third party vendors such as Google Analytics in order to analyze usage of our Services. These services utilize information that they retrieve from cookies on our Web Application or other information that we send them directly to provide us with aggregated analytics that we can use to perform our analysis. These analytics services will have their own privacy policies and terms of use. By using our Services, you are agreeing to the processing of this data by such analytics services.

We participate in network advertising programs that display advertising about our services on other unaffiliated websites. We use third party social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Linkedin, etc.) to show you [customized social media ads and interest-based ads](https://fellow.app/privacy-policy/advertising-definitions/).

### Information Collected from Others

By connecting your Calendar as mentioned earlier in this document, we will be able to determine who works with whom with your organization so as to offer you smart suggestions on how to improve your working relationships with people in your network, as well as allow the ability to take notes on each of your meetings.

Below we list the types of data we collect from the various Fellow apps for the communications platforms that we support. Each is only applicable if you or your organization has installed the respective app on the third party platform.

Note that the Fellow for Microsoft Teams app is enabled by the Microsoft Bot Framework. The Microsoft Bot Framework is a set of web-services that enable intelligent services and connections using conversation channels you authorize. As a service provider, Microsoft will transmit content you provide to our bot/service in order to enable the service. For more information about Microsoft privacy policies please see their privacy statement here: [**http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). In addition, your interactions with this bot/service are also subject to the conversational channel’s applicable terms of use, privacy and data collection policies. To report abuse when using a bot that uses the Microsoft Bot Framework to Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft Bot Framework website at [https://www.botframework.com](https://www.botframework.com/) and use the “Report Abuse” link in the menu to contact Microsoft.

We use anonymized data retrieved from our database (i.e. where personally identifiable information has been obfuscated) in order to create analytics that will help us surmise how to improve our Service. Some of the reports created with this anonymized data may be shared with your Organization so that they can understand the overall usage of our product by their employees/constituents.

Disclosure of Personal Information
----------------------------------

Disclosures of your Personal Data are described as below

### Designated 3rd Parties

We will share your Personal Data with parties that you have already consented to share information with such as your Organization and those in your Work Network. For example, feedback that you exchange with other Users in your Work Network will be viewed by them.

### Third Party Service Providers

We use a set of third parties as part of our system in order to offer you the Services that we do. Examples include analytics services (as described previously) and email service providers. Service Providers who process Personal Data on our behalf are considered Sub-Processors.

We use a set of third parties in order to offer you Artificial Intelligence (AI) Services such as processing intent, smart suggestions for your meetings, meeting recording services, transcription services, summarization, content creation, editing, question answering, intelligent search, etc…

The transfer of your organizations’ data to AI-related third party service providers can be controlled by administrators in your organization with a toggle in your Workspace settings in the Platform (Workspace Settings -> Security -> Artificial Intelligence). When this toggle is disabled, any features which rely on these third-party AI providers will also be disabled.  When the toggle is enabled, certain additional features will be available for your account that rely on these services (exclusively on a per-use basis of the respective features, not via background transfers). Any such features are appropriately decorated within the Platform with similar iconography.

A full list of our sub-processors, including our AI sub-processors is available [**here**](https://www.fellow.app/fellow-app-sub-processors/).

### Disclosure to Organization

Your organization may have specific policies in place regarding how Personal Data is shared to which we will have to comply.

### Business Transfers
