Symbaloo Privacy Policy
=======================

 Effective Date: November 12, 2024

Introduction
------------

At Symbaloo, we care deeply about privacy and recognize its importance to the educators, students, parents, and all users we serve. We are committed to following our legal obligations and best practices regarding the collection, usage, sharing, and storage of information.

This Privacy Policy applies to personal data collected at [www.symbaloo.com](https://www.symbaloo.com/) and other Symbaloo websites, as well as data collected through the provision of Symbaloo’s products or services, and it explains what information we gather, how we use it, and under what conditions, if any, we disclose it.

Privacy and your Institution
----------------------------

Symbaloo offers many products and services provided to end-users in connection with educational, corporate, or government institutions, which may have their own privacy guidelines. If you are an end-user using a Symbaloo product or service in connection with your institution, we recommend consulting with your institution to address any questions or concerns you may have. Symbaloo’s products or services are often customized by your institution to best meet its needs and comply with its own privacy guidelines.

Please note that this policy does not supersede the terms of any agreement Symbaloo may have with your institution, nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between your institution and you or any other third party. Be sure to read the terms of any privacy policy or agreement you enter into with any party, including your institution, as that policy or agreement may explain how your personal information will be collected, stored, and used.
