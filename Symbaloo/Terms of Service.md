These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access and use the Products (the “Users”).

By accessing or using the Products you agree to be bound by these Terms. We may revise these Terms from time-to-time, the most current version will always be at the referenced link. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you through the Products or through Email. By continuing to access or use the Products after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms supersedes or limits your rights under (1) the terms and conditions of any written agreement you have entered into with Symbaloo regarding the use of Products, or (2) any applicable laws or regulations, to the extent these Terms are prohibited by such laws or regulations. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions of any applicable written agreement you have entered into with Symbaloo, the terms and conditions of the written agreement shall control.

1\. General Terms
-----------------

You are responsible for your use of the Products. Your access to and use of the Products, and the extent of any such access and use, may be controlled at Symbaloo’s sole discretion.

Symbaloo’s Products are always evolving, and the form, nature, and/or functionality of the Products may change from time to time, without prior notice to you. Symbaloo retains the right to temporarily or permanently stop providing a Product and/or a feature within a Product to you or to Users generally, without prior notice. Symbaloo also retains the right to create and/or modify limitations on usage or storage at its sole discretion at any time without prior notice.

If you are accepting these Terms and using the Products on behalf of an institution, company, organization, government, or other legal entity (individually or collectively, an “Institution”), then (a) “you” includes you and that institution, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the institution with the authority to bind the institution to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the institution’s behalf. You may use the Products only in compliance with these Terms, any agreement entered into by your institution relating to the Products, and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.

In cases where you have authorized or registered another individual, including a minor, to use Symbaloo’s Products, you are fully responsible for (i) the online conduct of such user; (ii) controlling the user’s access to and use of the Products; and (iii) the consequences of any misuse.
