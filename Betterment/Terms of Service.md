Choice of Law
-------------

All Website activity or use and these Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the United States of America and the applicable laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate
------------------------------------------

You and Betterment (for purposes of this section, “the parties”) agree that any claim or controversy that may arise between you and Betterment relating in any way to your use of the publicly available portions of the Platform will be determined by binding arbitration conducted under the auspices of JAMS pursuant to its Arbitration Rules and Procedures. This arbitration agreement includes any controversy involving the performance, construction, or breach of these Terms and Conditions.

You and Betterment agree that the arbitration shall apply the substantive law of New York to all state law claims, that limited discovery shall be conducted in accordance with JAMS’s Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and that the arbitrator may not award punitive or exemplary damages, unless (but only to the extent that) such damages are required by statute to be an available remedy for any of the specific claims asserted. In accordance with JAMS’s Arbitration Rules and Procedures, the arbitrator’s award shall consist of a written statement as to the disposition of each claim and the relief, if any, awarded on each claim. The award shall not include or be accompanied by any findings of fact, conclusions of law, or other written explanations of the reasons for the award. You understand that the right to appeal or to seek modification of any ruling or award by the arbitrator is severely limited under state and federal law. You acknowledge that you are waiving your right to a jury trial. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction and the parties hereto and their respective representatives hereby submit to the jurisdiction of any such court for the purpose of such arbitration and the entering of such judgment.

Federal and state statutes of limitation, repose, and/or other rules, laws, or regulations impose time limits for bringing claims in federal and state court actions and proceedings. The parties agree that all federal or state statutes of limitation, repose, and/or other rules, laws, or regulations imposing time limits that would apply in federal or state court, apply to any Controversy, and such time limits are hereby incorporated by reference. Therefore, to the extent that a Controversy would be barred by a statute of limitation, repose or other time limit, if brought in a federal or state court action or proceeding, the parties agree that such Controversy shall be barred in an arbitration proceeding.

Any award of the arbitrator or a majority of the arbitrators will be final and binding, and judgment on such award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This arbitration provision will be enforced and interpreted exclusively in accordance with applicable federal laws of the United States, including the Federal Arbitration Act. Any costs, attorneys’ fees or taxes involved in confirming or enforcing the award will be fully assessed against and paid by the party resisting confirmation or enforcement of said award.

You agree to the following additional provisions regardless of your place of residence at the time a Controversy arises:

* You agree that any arbitration hearing will be held in New York, New York;
* You agree to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New York, United States, to interpret and enforce the arbitration provisions described in these Terms and Conditions; and
* All arbitrations will be held in the English language, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

You agree that this agreement to arbitrate shall be binding on you, your heirs, administrators, representatives, executors, successors and assigns.

Class Action Waiver
-------------------

You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. You agree that you may bring claims against us only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.

Waiver and Severability
-----------------------

Any waiver of any provision contained in these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other right, term, or provision of these Terms and Conditions. If any provision in these Terms and Conditions is determined to be wholly or partially invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the extent it is legal and valid and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.

Assignment
----------

You may not assign these Terms and Conditions (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Betterment, and any prohibited assignment will be null and void. Betterment may assign these Terms and Conditions or any rights hereunder without your consent.

Platform and Terms Subject to Change
