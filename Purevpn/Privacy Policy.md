Other than users’ data, it is important for PureVPN to keep a record of all user correspondence to ensure smooth service delivery and superior customer service. We keep a record of all correspondence, be it questions, complaints or compliments submitted via our apps, website or extensions.

PureVPN uses multiple third-party platforms for customer support and correspondence:

* Zendesk: for support tickets (read their privacy policy [here](https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/privacy-policy//)).

The customer’s name and email address are stored with the third-party platform when they correspond with PureVPN while using any of these services.

#### International data transfers

Our systems are spread across the globe, which means the stored data is traveling through servers in multiple locations which might or might not be in the customer’s country of residence. While we rely on some third-party service providers to deliver our services, we make sure that the stored data is protected during this process. PureVPN has strict data protection agreements in place with all providers.

It is important for users to understand that their stored data will be transferred and/or processed when required, as it is an integral part to maintain excellence in our services and live up to our Terms of Service.

![](https://images.purevpn-tools.com/public/images/security-data.png)

Security of collected information
---------------------------------

With the exception to the stored data mentioned in section 2, PureVPN neither stores any user data nor shares, sells or rents it out to any third party. Hence no such information is kept with us.
