 Privacy Policy

Updated on May 14th, 2024

Privacy Policy
--------------

Your Privacy Matters
--------------------

Welcome to FlipHTML5.com ("FlipHTML5", "Platform" or "Site", "Website"). We understand that the privacy of our register members, subscribers, guests and/or visitors ("Users", "you" or "your") is very important. As such, we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal data is collected, processed, maintained and disposed by us and our 3rd party service providers ("Suppliers"). 

The Privacy Policy describes how we treat your Personal Information when you use FlipHTML5 services ("Services"). The following describes our privacy practices that are specific to FlipHTML5.com. We reserve the right to update it at any time, and all changes are effective upon posting without notice to you. You are encouraged to revisit this page from time to time. Your use of the Site or our Services after such changes constitutes your agreement to such changes.

1\. Who we are
--------------

1.1 FlipHTML5 is an international tech company, providing several Services that enables registered Users to upload, create, edit and promote their content, in particular publications and other content.

1.2 Our address headquarter is located at: Room 1003, 10/F, Tower 1, Lippo Centre, 89 Queensway, Admiralty, Hong Kong. The company is duly incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong.

1.3 Operationally we are in compliance with, though not bound to do so, the general requirements on personal data collection and usage recommended by the United States Federal Trade Commissions guidance on "Mobile Privacy Disclosures",  European General Data Protection Regulation and California's Online Privacy Protection Act. In particular, we carry out Privacy Compliance Assessment exercises periodically to ensure compliance in respect of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

1.4 Owing to the global nature of the Company's business conducted over the internet, it is practically impossible for us to comply with all applicable laws/rules/regulations (and the like) as may be prescribed by individual country/region/city. We endeavor to adopt internationally recommended "Best Practices" whilst adhering to the [Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance](https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/ordinance_at_a_Glance/ordinance.html), laws of Hong Kong which you must agree to as the applicable law in case of dispute arising herefrom.

**1.5  Data Controller**

1.5.1 FlipHTML5 is the data controller for the personal data collected from Users domiciled within the EU when using the Services.

1.5.2 We will process your personal data in compliance with European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").

1.5.3 This privacy policy covers our processing of personal data processed if you are domiciled within the EU, when you use the Services.

2\. What info we collect 
-------------------------

The types of Personal Information that we collect fall under two general categories: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). PII consists of any information which can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas non-PII consists of aggregate information or any information that does not reveal your identity. The following paragraphs explain what PII and non-PII we collect from you, and how we use such information.

**2.1 Cookies.** We use "cookies" to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our Website or using our Services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new ones. They also allow us to save member preferences and track member trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our Website; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the Website will not function properly and you may not enjoy all of our Services. Members who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality of our Website. We do not link the cookies to any of our members' PII. See more detailed information in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.wonderidea.com/cookie-policy/).

**2.2 Log activity.** We receive information every time you view or interact with content on our site, even if you don't have an account. Log activity information covers a variety of data that is available to FlipHTML5 either through 3rds party service providers or collected directly by us: browser information, OS type, device used, IP, chat activity, date, time and duration for each site visit, referring web page, page visits, search terms, location, cookies, clicks, views and session duration for all site pages. We generally analyze sets of data to make sure our services are fully functional, to ensure reliable and secure performance. We also use such information to better understand user needs, to improve our site performance, and to send relevant marketing messages that match your interests.

**2.3 Web Beacons.** "Web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs" and "pixel tags") are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our Website for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our visitors. We may also use web beacons in email communications sent to you in order to understand the behavior of our members. We do not link the web beacons to any of our members' PII.

**2.4 Mobile Analytics.** We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use our application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any of your submitted PII within the mobile application.

**2.5 Your Information.** When you register or subscribe to any of our Services, we collect a wide variety of information about you. 

**2.6 Purchase Information.** You may provide payment information on our site, when purchasing a premium subscription. We do not store payment information, such as debit/credit card number, CVV code or PayPal address on our database or servers. This information is processed and stored on the servers of our reliable and secure payment processors in order to enable recurring payments to us.

Our e-mail messages may contain codes that enable our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were opened.

None of these details are mandatory for setting up an account, but we recommend displaying them on your profile, if you have any interest in branding or promoting your content. You are responsible for the information that you share on your profile and the content of your catalogs, so you should think carefully about what you want to publish publicly. For sensitive information that you wish to keep private or share with a limited group of individuals, we recommend publishing your content privately.

If you update your public information on our site it may automatically be updated on our website.

In addition to displaying your public information and your content on our site, we also provide technology such as APIs and embeds to give you the option to make your content available on other sites or platforms.

Your password is non-reversibly encrypted before being saved to the database, for your protection, so it cannot be copied or stolen, even in case of a hacking attack. We also use your email address to get in touch with you and to send you information about our services and to market to you according to your country's laws.

We make this data available directly in the publisher's account under statistics and in Google Analytics (for premium users who are using the Analytics integration). This type of information is important for our users who need to understand how their publications are performing in order to be able to optimize them or refine their marketing strategies.

All data collected on the Services are safe and secure. We will not make public any private information or content published privately on our site. We may, however, disclose your private personal data to a few, reliable 3rd party service providers ("Suppliers" ), solely for the purpose of operating our services: to help us provide, analyze, and improve the service, including data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the site's functionality.
