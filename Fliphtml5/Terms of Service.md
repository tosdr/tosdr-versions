**3.2 Payment Information.**  
You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your FlipHTML5 account in a timely manner with a valid payment method.

● Your "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service.

Your Payment Method will still be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date.
