The applicable Paid Service will automatically commence, and your Payment Method will be charged in accordance with Section 3.2, at the end of the Free Trial unless you log into your account and cancel the Paid Service before the end of the Free Trial.

**3.2 Payment Information.**  
You are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your FlipHTML5 account in a timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize FlipHTML5 or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method identified by you ("Payment Method"), which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid Service, including all applicable taxes.

**3.3 Subscriptions.**  
For purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:  
● Your "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service. For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for your first monthly subscription and all other monthly subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next month or year, as applicable.  
● For any subscription to a Paid Service that you purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established, your Payment Method will first be not charged a pro-rata amount of the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment Method will still be charged the full periodic subscription fee for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription Billing Date.

You agree that our 3rd party payment processors shall be permitted to charge your credit card monthly in advance of providing the Service if you choose monthly payment mode.

Accounts that are not collectable by our 3rd party payment processors may be turned over to an outside collection agency for collection.

**3.4 Termination of Subscriptions.**

You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period's (i.e., month's or year's) subscription fees to your Payment Method. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information).

For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your FlipHTML5 account upon demand, (ii) FlipHTML5 may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) FlipHTML5 reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one or more FlipHTML5 Services or your account with FlipHTML5.
