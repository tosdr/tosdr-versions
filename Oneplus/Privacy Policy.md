In addition to the personal data you provide yourself, we may also automatically collect information about your use of our Services, particularly when you are using your device. The personal data we may collect includes the following:

   **• Device information:** This may include the device name, device model, region and language settings, device identification number (IMEI number), device hardware information and status, IP address, MAC address, operating system version and the settings of the device used to access the Service.

   **• Log information:** This may include when and how long the Service is used, search terms entered through the Service and the device error logs. The Android system on your smartphone and/or wearable is designed in such a way that your error or crash log will contain information collected at the time of the event, which allows us to analyse the reasons for the crash. Such information may sometimes include your personal data, such as phone number, email address, Google account or Facebook account. However, we have implemented security measures to ensure that this information is used only for error log analysis and not for personal identification or other purposes.

   **• Location information:** This may include the GPS signal of the device or information about Wi-Fi access points and base stations near you, or the device location ID and network service provider ID when you access some location-based services (for example when you use the weather app).

We do not link information that we store in analytics software to any personal data you may submit through our mobile apps.

We and our third-party partners also use Cookies to analyse trends, manage websites, track user activity across these websites and collect aggregate demographic information about our user base.

Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.

### If the "Do Not Track" function is enabled in your browser, we will respect your choice.

Where required by law, we will provide you with further information about cookies.

### V. How Long We Keep Your Personal Data

We will only store your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the collection purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. If we are required by law to store your personal data beyond this period (such as for tax and commercial law reasons), we will delete the personal data at the end of this storage period.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use and disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and the applicable legal requirements.

If, after you sign up for our promotional emails, you unsubscribe from receiving our promotional emails, we will delete your personal data from our mailing lists. However, we will continue to store your email address in a blocklist to ensure that you will not receive any further communication.

### VI. How We Disclose Your Personal Data

At times OnePlus may make certain personal data available to other companies that are wholly or jointly controlled by us (**"Affiliates"**) and other third parties that work with OnePlus in order to provide Services to you. Your personal data will not be shared with third parties for their own independent marketing purposes.

   **• Affiliates:** Your personal data may be shared with OnePlus's Affiliates for the purpose of rendering our Services to you. If Affiliates wish to process data for a different purpose, they must first seek your consent, unless another lawful basis exists.

   **• Service Providers and Partners:** SSome of our Services will be provided with the assistance of third parties. We may also share some personal data with our partners in particular so as to deliver you a better service and improve your user experience. For example, when you use the security centre app, third-party service providers are used to scan for viruses and free up storage space on your phone, and we engage third-party service providers to provide you with enhanced customer service. We may also rely on service providers to identify and serve targeted advertisements, provide email services, provide tax and accounting services, organise competitions and deliver web hosting or analytics services. Any such service providers will, through appropriate data processing agreements, be bound to only process personal data on OnePlus’s behalf and under our instructions, unless such service providers act as independent controllers.

   **• Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction:** Where a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation or similar action takes place, we may transfer or disclose your personal data to a limited, but necessary extent to the applicable third party.

   **• Law enforcement, regulators and other parties for legal reasons:** We may also disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law, or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a subpoena or other legal proceedings, legal actions or government agency requests; (b) when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (c) to protect and exercise our legal claims, rights and property; (d) to protect your rights, property or personal safety or that of others; (e) to investigate fraud and (f) to protect the security or integrity of our Services.

   **• The public, when posted in certain public spaces:** Some of our Services allow you to connect and interact with others. Your profile information or information that you post in a forum or on a blog, including personal data, will be accessible to other users or the general public by default when you create it. Such content will be accessible by the general public or the members of the Service depending on the Service used.

   **• Otherwise with consent:** We may disclose your personal data to certain other third parties with your consent.

### VII. How Your Personal Data Is Transferred Globally

We leverage our resources and servers around the world to provide Services. We have data centres in the U.S., France, Singapore, India and Indonesia, which means that in compliance with applicable laws, your personal data might be transferred to or accessed from countries or regions outside the province or country where you use our Services.

Please note that different countries or regions offer different levels of data protection. This means that your personal data could be stored in a country or region that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than the country or region in which you are located. However, in such cases, we will take measures to ensure that the personal data we collect is processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws, and that your personal data is adequately protected. For example, we might ask your permission to transfer your personal data across borders, and we will implement adequate security measures (such as encryption and de-identification where feasible) and sign the necessary data transmission/sharing agreements with the recipients of your personal data prior to the transfer taking place. We will also specifically ensure that we comply with laws that require us to store data locally within a specific country or region.

### VIII. How We Protect Your Personal Data

The security of your personal data is very important to us. We have taken reasonably practical, technical and organisational measures in accordance with industry standards to protect personal data collected in connection with our Service and prevent it from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. However, please note that while we have taken reasonable measures to protect your personal data, no websites, Internet transmissions, computer systems or wireless connections are absolutely secure. In particular:

   • Where appropriate, we will de-identify your personal data to mitigate the risk that other organisations or individuals may identify you on the basis of that personal data. We may also implement full security encryption during storage and transmission to prevent your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure (such as by using SSL to encrypt many Services). We regularly review practices regarding personal data collection, storage and processing (including physical security measures) to prevent unauthorised access to or tampering with our various systems and your personal data.

   • We only allow our employees and personnel of authorised service companies to access such personal data on a need-to-know basis, in order to process such personal data or provide relevant Services to you. These employees and external personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held liable and/or their relationship with OnePlus may be terminated.

   • When transmitting and storing special categories of personal data, we use extra security measures, such as encryption of the transmitted content. We also use technical measures to process your personal biometric information so that we only need to store essential data (such as basic parameters necessary to identify a person, but not the raw facial and fingerprint data).

   • We carefully select our business partners and service providers and ensure that they are sufficiently bound to protect personal data and will be subject to privacy audits and assessments.

   • We conduct security and privacy protection training, testing and other activities to enhance employee awareness of and proficiency in personal data protection.

   • We use international and industry-recognised standards to protect your personal data and actively pursue relevant security and privacy protection accreditation.

   • We promise not to sell personal data to any third party and guarantees the legitimate and fair use of user information only to the extent permitted by law.

In case of a personal data security incident, we will act in accordance with applicable law and notify you and/or the competent data protection authority of any such security incident where required, and take measures to mitigate any risks arising therefrom.

### IX. Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data

Subject to applicable laws in your jurisdiction, you may have specific rights regarding your personal data. This may include the following rights in particular:

   **• The right to be informed:** OnePlus is publishing this Privacy Notice to keep you informed as to how we handle your personal data and what options and rights you have regarding your personal data.

   **• The right to access:** If you wish to access your personal data, some of our Services provide an interface through which you may directly search for or access certain personal data. You may also request access to the personal data we hold about you and information about its processing.

   **• The right to rectification:** If you find that the personal data we process about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to ask us to make rectifications without undue delay and request the completion of your personal data where appropriate.

   **• The right to withdraw consent:** You may withdraw your consent to our use or disclosure of your personal data at any time. In some cases, withdrawal of your consent may mean that we will no longer be able to provide certain products or services. Please also note that certain data will remain within the Services for us to fulfill our contractual obligations, even after you withdraw your consent.

      **• You can opt out of the User Experience Program at any time through your device settings or by contacting us:** (please refer to the section "Contact Us" below). After you opt out of the Program, we will delete or anonymise all data collected from your device for the Program.

      **• Unsubscribe from marketing communications:** If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications, you may unsubscribe from such communications at any time using the method provided in each promotional message.

      **• The right to deactivate your OnePlus account.** You can deactivate your account via [https://www.oneplus.com/ca\_en/customer/info#/](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/customer/info#/), by choosing “Deactivate my account”. Your account will have a 15-day deactivation period, followed immediately by account deletion. You may choose to reactivate your account at any time within 15 days. Afterwards, your account will be permanently deleted.

You may also have additional privacy rights depending on the region in which you are located. In particular, if you live in Europe, please see the GDPR-specific Section.

If you wish to exercise a privacy right, you may contact our privacy officer at [privacy.na@oneplus.com](mailto:privacy.na@oneplus.com).

In the interest of security, we may ask you to verify your identity before processing your request. In principle, we do not charge a fee for responding to your reasonable request. However, for multiple and repetitive requests that exceed a reasonable limit, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover some of our costs, depending on the nature of the request. We are entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, and we may refuse requests that are manifestly unfounded, unreasonably repetitive or that require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests that require the development of new systems). In addition, we may not respond to requests that directly concern significant issues of public interest or may cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of you or other individuals or entities.

Certain regions might entitle you to refer the complaint to the relevant regulatory authority if you are not satisfied with the response you received.

### X. How We Process Children's Personal Data

Our Services are mainly intended for adults. A child should not use our Services without his/her legal guardian’s consent. We treat anyone less than 18 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age for full legal capacity in the relevant jurisdiction) as a child.

If we discover that a child's personal data has been collected, we will delete the corresponding data as soon as possible.

If you believe that we might have any personal data concerning a child, please contact us using the "Contact Us" section.

### XI. Third-Party Websites

OnePlus Services may contain links to third-party websites, products and services. You can choose whether to access websites or accept products and services provided by third parties or not. For example, the "Follow us" function on our official website provides links to our official social media accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter) where you can view marketing or promotional information published by OnePlus .

We do not control third-party privacy and data protection policies and do not accept any responsibility or liability for such policies. At the same time, such third parties are not bound by this Privacy Notice. Therefore, before submitting personal data to third parties, we strongly recommend that you refer to the privacy protection practices of such third parties.

### XII. How This Privacy Notice Is Updated

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Notice from time to time. We will, as appropriate, send you notifications of material updates to this Privacy Notice in a form we deem appropriate and we will update the "last updated" date at the start of this Privacy Notice.

### B. GDPR-Specific Provisions

### I. Legal Bases for the Processing of Personal Data

Our processing of your personal data as described in the Section "How We Use Your Personal Data" is based on the following legal grounds:

1\. the recipient of the personal data is located within a country that benefits from an "adequacy" decision of the European Commission;

2\. the recipient has signed a contract based on "model contractual clauses" approved by the European Commission, obliging them to protect your personal data;

3\. or in the absence of the above appropriate safeguards, we will ask you for your explicit consent for the cross-border transfer of your personal data or take any other measures that are recognised as providing a sufficient level of protection for your personal data.

   **• The right to erasure:** You can submit a request to us to delete personal data, and we shall have the obligation to erase it without undue delay in some circumstances – for example, if we do not have a legal reason to continue to process the personal data to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations. Please note in so far as you delete all the data that is contained in your device, this does not mean that you have deleted all data that OnePlus collects and processes about you. Therefore, we encourage you to contact us (please refer to the section "Contact Us" above) to request that your personal data is deleted.

   **• The right to restriction of processing:** You have the right, in certain circumstances, to request OnePlus to temporarily restrict the processing of your personal data, such as where the accuracy of that personal data is contested by you, while we verify the accuracy of that personal data.

   **• THE RIGHT TO OBJECT:** You have the right to object to any processing justified by legitimate interests based on grounds relating to your particular situation at any time. Should you decide to object to the processing of your personal data, we will stop processing personal data that concerns you, unless we can demonstrate compelling reasons for continuing to process your personal data that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or in the case that we establish, exercise or defend our legal claims. You can object to direct marketing activities at any time for any reason whatsoever.

   **• The right to data portability:** You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format and transmit such data to another provider or have such data transmitted to another provider under certain circumstances.

If you withdraw your consent, we may no longer be able to provide you with the corresponding Service.
