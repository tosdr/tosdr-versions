7.2 All User Content must comply with the Content Standards set out in Article IX, below, of these Terms of Use.

7.3 When you share User Content, you continue to own the intellectual property rights thereto and you are free to share it with anyone else wherever you want.

By sharing any User Content on the Site, you grant to us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns, a non-exclusive, unlimited, worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable right to use, copy, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, translate, publish, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose. You further agree that OnePlus may sublicense such rights.

8.2 OnePlus may also take any other action with respect to any User Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Content (intentionally or unintentionally) violates the Terms of Use (including the Content Standards set forth in Article IX below), infringes any intellectual property right or other right of OnePlus or any other person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or could create liability for OnePlus. OnePlus also may disclose your identity or other information (including any transmittal or communication by you through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site) about you if we determine (subject to applicable laws and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/legal/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy")) that such disclosure is necessary: (i) to enforce our legal rights under these Terms of Use and to protect the security and integrity of the Site; or (ii) in connection with any claim by OnePlus or a third party that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes).

8.3 Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Site.

8.4 We do not, however, undertake to review all material before it is posted on the Site, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party.

Moreover, if OnePlus does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms of Use, OnePlus will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to OnePlus.

14.7 THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

### XV. Limitation of Liability

15.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ONEPLUS, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, AND WHETHER BASED ON TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ONEPLUS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, AND EVEN FOR ANY CLAIMS YOU MAY BRING AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY THAT PARTY FOR SUCH CLAIM.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE FOREGOING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE BENEFITS OF THE SITE AND YOU WILL ACCEPT SUCH RISK AND/OR INSURE ACCORDINGLY.

15.2 If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, OnePlus is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF ONEPLUS, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, AND DIRECTORS shall in no event exceed the greater of (I) us$100.00; OR (II) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO ONEPLUS (in the six (6) months prior to the date of your initial claim) FOR THE APPLICABLE CONTENT, PRODUCT(s), OR SERVICE(s), INCLUDING any subscription or similar fees with respect to your OnePlus account (or any other service or feature of or on the Site), out of which the liability arose.

Some jurisdictions do not allow such a cap on liability resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct, or death or bodily injury caused by products you purchase, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.

15.3 NONE OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

### XVI. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless OnePlus, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, predecessors, successors, and assigns, from and against any third-party claims, actions, demands, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (i) your violation of these Terms of Use; (ii) your use of the Site, including, but not limited to, your User Content, any use of the Site’s Content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use, or your use of any information obtained from the Site; or (iii) any violation of any laws or regulations or the rights of any third party by you.

### XVII. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Limitation on Time to File Claims

17.1 All matters arising out of or relating to the Site and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), are governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and (only to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of Article XVIII below and the substantive and procedural provisions of the FAA) the internal laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of California. The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving OnePlus to which you are not a party. Other than claims that must be resolved through binding arbitration (or that may be brought in small claims court), any disputes relating to these Terms of Use or the Site will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California; the parties consent to personal and exclusive jurisdiction in these courts and waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than claims that must be resolved through binding arbitration (or that may be brought in small claims court), OnePlus reserves the right to institute proceedings and/or apply for injunctive remedies (or any equivalent type of urgent legal relief) against the user in the courts having jurisdiction in the place where the user has its seat or in any jurisdiction where harm to OnePlus is occurring.

17.2 These Terms of Use will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

17.3 ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

### XVIII. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ONEPLUS.

18.1 YOU AND ONEPLUS ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS FURTHER SET FORTH BELOW IN THIS SECTION 18) OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

18.2 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES, OR CONTROVERSIES (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT, OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE, AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND ONEPLUS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) THE SITE; (II) THESE TERMS OF USE AND PRIOR VERSIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE, OR THE EXISTENCE, BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION, SCOPE, WAIVER, OR VALIDITY THEREOF; OR (III) YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ONEPLUS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “COVERED DISPUTES”), WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE COVERED DISPUTE OCCURRED OR ACCRUED BEFORE OR AFTER THE DATE YOU AGREED TO THESE TERMS OF USE.

18.3 Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms of Use, this agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and the FAA will govern its interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties to be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, that the applicable arbitration provider’s rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law, and that the agreement to arbitrate be broadly interpreted.

18.4 This agreement to arbitrate applies (i) whether your dispute is with OnePlus, its subsidiaries, affiliates, or parent company, or any suppliers or service providers involved with the Site or OnePlus’s products and services, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, assigns, predecessors, and successors; and (ii) regardless of the legal theory on which you base your claim (such as breach of warranty, breach of contract, negligence, etc.). This agreement to arbitrate will also be binding upon, and shall include any claims brought by, any other third parties, including, without limitation, your spouse, heirs, third-party beneficiaries, successors, and assigns, where their underlying claims arise out of or relate to a Covered Dispute.

18.5 For Covered Disputes specifically relating to these Terms of Use or the Site, this agreement to arbitrate supersedes any terms regarding dispute resolution in any other agreement between you and OnePlus and contains the whole agreement between you and OnePlus with respect to any such disputes or claims.

18.6 The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and will be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures applicable to consumer disputes, and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules, unless the parties agree to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this Article XVIII. The JAMS Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com.

18.7 For disputes arising in a jurisdiction where JAMS cannot or will not administer the arbitration, the parties shall be required to meet and confer to select a neutral arbitration provider. Such an arbitration provider shall have operations in the state in which the dispute arises. If the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitration provider, then either party may invoke 9 U.S.C. § 5 to request that a court of competent jurisdiction appoint an arbitration provider with operations in the state in which the dispute arises. Any arbitration provider appointed by a court under 9 U.S.C. § 5 shall conduct arbitration solely on an individualized basis as set forth herein. Once the parties mutually agree upon a neutral arbitration provider, or an arbitrator provider is appointed under 9 U.S.C. § 5, the ensuing arbitration shall commence pursuant to the rules of the designated arbitration provider, except as otherwise designated herein. Once an arbitration provider is agreed upon or appointed, an arbitrator shall be appointed. The arbitrator will be either (i) a retired judge, or (ii) an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration is conducted with experience in the law underlying the dispute. The arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the applicable arbitration provider’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator after a good faith meet and confer effort, then the applicable arbitration provider will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with its rules.

18.8 We each agree that, as a condition precedent to initiating any arbitration or other legal proceedings, the parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve any Covered Dispute. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve any Covered Dispute within a reasonable period (which, in any event, shall not exceed sixty (60) days), you or OnePlus may initiate an arbitration proceeding by (i) sending a written notice (entitled, and referred to herein as a, “Demand for Arbitration”) to the other party by mail; AND (ii) sending an electronic copy of the Demand for Arbitration to legal-usa@oneplus.com (if the Demand for Arbitration is from you) or to any email address that you provide to us when registering a OnePlus account or purchasing OnePlus product(s) or that you otherwise publish through the Site (if the Demand for Arbitration is from OnePlus). Any Demand for Arbitration that you send to OnePlus should be delivered to our principal place of business at: OnePlus, Attn: Legal Department, Re: Demand for Arbitration, 2479 E Bayshore Rd STE 120, Palo Alto, CA 94303.

18.9 Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place (at your option) in Santa Clara County, California or in the county in which you reside. However, subject to the approval of the arbitrator and OnePlus, you may decide whether you want the arbitration to be conducted instead: (i) based on written submissions without an oral hearing, or (ii) through a telephone or videoconference hearing.

18.10 All issues in dispute are for the arbitrator to decide. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 18.14 below, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, arbitrability, and/or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, whether a dispute can be arbitrated, or the interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge to the effect that these arbitration provisions or these Terms of Use are void, voidable, or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator shall, in accordance with the JAMS Rules, allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute, and shall enter orders as appropriate in order to protect the parties’ trade secrets or confidential information. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator is not bound by decisions reached in separate arbitrations, and the arbitrator’s decision shall be binding only upon the parties to the arbitration that are the subject of the decision. The arbitrator shall award reasonable costs incurred in the arbitration to the prevailing party in accordance with the law(s) of the state in which arbitration is held.

18.11 Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, OnePlus will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the cost of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the cost of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, OnePlus will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the parties will use the JAMS Rules to determine whether you or OnePlus is responsible for the filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees.

18.12 The foregoing notwithstanding, if a party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, either party may choose to take the claim to that court instead of arbitration as follows: (i) a party may take its claim to small claims court without first sending a Demand for Arbitration to the other party; (ii) a party that receives a Demand for Arbitration can, within thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of the Demand for Arbitration (the “Forum Determination Period”), send written notice (in the manner prescribed in Section 18.8 above) to the opposing party that it wants the case decided by a small claims court; (iii) after the expiration of the Forum Determination Period and after a case is filed with JAMS, but before the issuance of a Commencement Letter (as such term is defined in the JAMS Rules), a party can send written notice (in the manner prescribed in Section 18.8 above) to the opposing party and JAMS that it wants the case decided by a small claims court (after receiving this notice, JAMS will administratively close the case); and (iv) after the expiration of the Forum Determination Period, after a case is filed with JAMS, and after the issuance of a Commencement Letter, the parties may mutually agree in writing that the arbitration case should be closed and the dispute decided in small claims court. The small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy and will not be consolidated with any other action or conducted on a class-wide, representative, or class-action basis. Neither party may file a case with jams (for a claim that is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court) until after the expiration of the Forum Determination Period.

18.13 The forgoing notwithstanding, you or OnePlus may file suit in court to address an intellectual property rights infringement claim (as set forth in Section 17.1 above).

18.14 You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR ONEPLUS WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER USERS OF THE SITE IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, IN A REPRESENATIVE CAPACITY, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of you, the individual party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief that is warranted by your individual claim, and not any remedy that affects other users of the Site or third parties. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations set forth in this Section 18.14 as to a particular claim for relief or remedy (such as declaratory or injunctive relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and must be brought in the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California or in the county in which you reside, while the remaining claims and remedies (such as individual damages or restitution) will still be resolved through binding arbitration.

18.15 You can choose to reject the agreement to arbitrate (“opt out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these Terms of Use. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to OnePlus at the following address: OnePlus, Attn: Legal Department, Re: Opt-Out Notice, 2479 E Bayshore Rd STE 120, Palo Alto, CA 94303. Your Opt-Out Notice must include a statement that you intend to opt out of the arbitration agreement in the OnePlus Website Terms of Use, together with your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and any email address that you used in connection with registering a OnePlus account or purchasing OnePlus product(s) or that you otherwise published through the Site. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice in order for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of the Terms of Use will continue to apply. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements you may have with us.

18.16 Subject to the provisions of Section 18.14 above, if any provision of this agreement to arbitrate is found unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the balance of this agreement to arbitrate will remain in full force and effect. Severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the agreement to arbitrate. To the extent any claims must proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

18.17 Subject to the provisions of Section 18.14 above, (i) the substance of any disputes where public injunctive relief is available shall be decided by the arbitrator; and (ii) only if the claimant succeeds on its claim permitting the remedy of public injunction may such claimant request that a court of competent jurisdiction enter an injunction in conformity with the arbitral award.

### IX. Miscellaneous

19.1 No waiver by OnePlus of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of OnePlus to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

19.2 If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, such that the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

19.3 These Terms of Use, our [Terms of Sale](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/legal/terms-of-sales "Terms of Use"), [Privacy Policy](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/legal/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy"), [Copyright/Intellectual Property Policy](https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/legal/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy"), any additional terms that accompany the Site, any amendments, and any additional agreements you may enter into with us shall constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and OnePlus regarding the Site and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Site. As set forth in Article XI, above, depending on which of our products or services you use, additional terms may apply. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that govern your use of third-party services, content, or software.

19.4 Except as expressly stated herein, these Terms of Use are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.

19.5 You may not voluntarily, or by operation of law, assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under these Terms of Use without the prior written consent of OnePlus. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your obligations under these Terms of Use. OnePlus, however, may transfer its rights and obligations under these Terms of Use to another organization.

19.6 You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any applicable export laws or regulations. You are responsible for complying with United States and foreign export controls and for any violation of such controls, including any United States embargoes or other rules and regulations restricting exports. You represent that you are not: (i) located in, or a resident or a national of, any country subject to a government embargo or other restriction, or that has been designated by any government as a “terrorist supporting” country; or (ii) on any government list of restricted end users.

19.7 Any provisions within these Terms of Use that by their nature should continue to be in effect, shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use, and remain valid and binding, including but not limited to Articles IV, V, VI, VII, X, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII.

19.8 The captions of sections of these Terms of Use are for convenience and reference only, and the words contained therein shall in no way be held to explain, modify, amplify, or aid in the interpretation, construction, or meaning of these Terms of Use. Any pronouns or references used herein shall be deemed to include the masculine, feminine, nonbinary, or neutral genders as appropriate. Any expression in the singular or the plural shall, if appropriate in the context, include both the singular and the plural. These Terms of Use shall be construed according to the fair meaning of their language and (to the extent legally permissible) the rule of construction, to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, will not be employed in interpreting these Terms of Use.
