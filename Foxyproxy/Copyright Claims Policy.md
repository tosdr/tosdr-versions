DMCA Policy
===========

FoxyProxy DMCA & Copyright Policy
---------------------------------

FoxyProxy implements automated virtual private network (“VPN”) and proxy services. Our service is completely automated. We do not log our users' activities. We do not select the recipients our users transmit to or the material our users access while using our services. We do not store, access, or modify any content that our users access while using our services.

Therefore, FoxyProxy's VPN/Proxy services qualify as a provider of transitory digital network communications under 17 U.S.C. § 512(a) of the Copyright Act. Since we do not store any content accessed by our users, we are unable to delete any infringing content. Because we do not log our users' activities in order to protect and respect their privacy, we are unable to identify individual users that may be infringing upon the lawful copyrights of others.

Copyright Infringement Notification
-----------------------------------

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, in order to file a copyright infringement notification with us, you must send written communication that includes:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
* Sufficient information for us to locate the allegedly infringing content;
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.
* Sufficient information to permit us to contact the complaining party such as an email address, telephone number, and physical mailing address.
* A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Your written Notification of Claimed Infringement must be sent to our Designated Copyright Agent at the email address below. We review and address all notices that substantially comply with the requirements identified above. If your notice does not substantially comply with all of these requirements, we can not respond to your notice.

Please note that you may be liable for damages if you make a false claim of copyright infringement. Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material is infringing is be subject to liability.
