Terms of Service
================

Last Update: June 2018

Service Agreement
-----------------

1\. Introduction
----------------

If you wish to access the products, services and computing equipment (referred to collectively as "Services" in this document) at getfoxyproxy.org ("Website") you must agree to abide by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). You accept these Terms if you access any of the Services.

2\. Eligibility
---------------

You must be of at least 18 years old and be legally eligible to access these Services.

3\. Termination
---------------

FoxyProxy may terminate your access immediately for violation of these terms. FoxyProxy may also terminate your access for any reason it deems injurious to the security or integrity of its Services and users.

4\. Third-Party Content And Services
------------------------------------

You acknowledge that FoxyProxy has no control over products and services provided by third parties, including (but not limited to) open proxies and that if you access these products and services, you do so at your own risk.

5\. Changes To Terms
--------------------

FoxyProxy may update these Terms at any time by making them available on the Site.

6\. Liability
-------------

FoxyProxy does not guarantee the results of the Services, and any use that you make of them shall be at your sole risk and expense. FoxyProxy shall not be liable to you for any special, indirect, consequential, lost profits, or punitive damages.

7\. Performance
---------------

FoxyProxy does not provide a specific bandwidth Service Level Agreement (SLA) or warrant the suitability of the Services for any particular application unless such an SLA or warranty is mutually agreed upon by you and FoxyProxy prior to your use of the Services. You acknowledge that streaming video applications may from time to time be adversely impacted by server and network load.

8\. Restrictions and Limitations
--------------------------------

Under normal circumstances, no restrictions or limitations are imposed on your Services. You are free to connect to any IP address, URL, or network device available on the public internet at unrestricted speeds and with unmetered bandwidth. However, in order to provide quality of service to all customers, FoxyProxy reserves the right to impose restrictions on your Services as it deems necessary. Such restrictions include but are not limited to: bandwidth throttling, bandwidth capping, temporary account disablement, changes to IP addresses, hostnames, or ports, restrictions on accessing IP addresses. FoxyProxy will make every reasonable effort to notify you of such restrictions or limitations prior to their implementation.

You agree not to share username, password, hostname, and IP address (referred to collectively as "account") with anyone except FoxyProxy Customer Support. You are welcome to use an account on any number of devices, but you agree that only one person will use the account.

9\. Force Majeure
-----------------

FoxyProxy shall not be responsible for delays or failures (including any delay by FoxyProxy to make progress in the prosecution of any Services) if such delay arises out of causes beyond its control. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God or of the public enemy, fires, floods, epidemics, riots, strikes, earthquakes, electrical outages, computer or communications failures, and severe weather, and acts or omissions of subcontractors or third parties.

10\. Refund Policy
------------------

You are entitled to a refund to one account for most any reason for 7 days after purchase. However, refunds are granted by FoxyProxy's sole discretion only. Here is a non-exhaustive list non-refundable transactions:

* Transactions older than 45 days cannot be refunded. This is a limitation of our bank.
* Refunds are not granted if your Service worked with a website at the time of purchase but stopped working before your term expired.
* Refunds are not granted if you use excessive bandwidth during or after the "7-day refund" period.
* Refunds are not granted for recurring payments that you failed to cancel before the billing date.
* Refunds are not granted for payments made using crypto currencies.
* Pro-rated refunds are not granted for partial service.
* If your account is terminated due to a Terms of Service violation, you are not entitled to any refund.
* If you purchase multiple accounts, the 7-day refund policy only applies to only one of those accounts. This is to prevent abuse.
* Refunds are not granted if you threaten and/or use offensive or abusive language.
* One-time setup fees (if any) and consulting fees (if any) are not refundable unless previously negotiated.
* Custom orders are not refundable unless previously negotiated. This is because we typically purchase items from our vendors for custom orders, and those vendors do not refund us.

11\. Governing Law
------------------

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. The language of these Terms shall be deemed to be the result of negotiation among the parties and their respective counsel and shall not be construed strictly for or against any party. Each party (i) agrees that any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be brought solely in courts of the State of Delaware, (ii) hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and (iii) agrees that, whenever a party is requested to execute one or more documents evidencing such consent, it shall do so immediately.
