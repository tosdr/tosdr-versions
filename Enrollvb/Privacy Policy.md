HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices
---------------------------------

This notice describes how health information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. We are required by applicable federal and state laws to maintain the privacy of your Protected Health Information (“PHI”), if applicable. This notice describes our privacy practices and our legal duties concerning your PHI. We will follow the privacy practices that are described in this notice while it is in effect. We reserve the right to change our privacy practices and the terms of this notice at any time and to make the terms of our notice effective for all PHI that we maintain.  Before we make a significant change in our privacy practices, we will change this notice and send the new notice to you.

### How We May Use Your Information

#### Without Specific Authorization

We have the right to use and disclose health information in certain instances. For example, we may use or disclose your health information:

* To You: We must disclose your PHI to you, as described in the Your Rights section of this notice.
    
* For Payment: For example, we may use and disclose PHI to pay claims for services provided to you by doctors, dentists or hospitals. We may also disclose your PHI to a health care provider or another health plan so that the provider or plan may obtain payment of a claim or engage in other payment activities.
    
* For Health Care Benefits: For example, we may use or disclose PHI to conduct quality assessment and improvement activities, to conduct fraud and abuse investigations, to engage in care coordination or case management, or to communicate with you about health related benefits and services or treatment alternatives that may be of interest to you. We may also disclose PHI to a health care provider or another health plan subject to federal privacy laws, as long as the provider or plan has or had a relationship with you and the PHI is disclosed only for certain health care operations of that provider or plan. We may also disclose PHI to other entities with which we have contracted to perform or provide certain services on our behalf (i.e. business associates).
    
* For Public Health and Safety: We may use or disclose PHI to the extent necessary to avert a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of you or others. We may also disclose PHI for public health and government health care oversight activities and to report suspected abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to government authorities.
    
* As Required by Law: We may use or disclose PHI when we are required to do so by law.
    
* For Process and Proceedings: We may disclose PHI in response to a court or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process.
    
* For Law Enforcement: We may disclose PHI to a law enforcement official with regard to crime victims and criminal activities.
    
* Special Government Functions: We may disclose the PHI of military personnel or inmates or other persons in lawful custody under certain circumstances. We may disclose PHI to authorized federal officials for lawful national security activities.
    
* For Research, Death, and Organ Donation: We may use or disclose PHI in certain circumstances related to research, death or organ donation.
    
* For Workers’ Compensation: We may disclose PHI as permitted by workers’ compensation and similar laws.
    

#### Only After Authorization is Received

You may give us written authorization to use your PHI or disclose it to anyone for any purpose not otherwise permitted or required by law. If you give us an authorization, you may revoke it in writing at any time. Your revocation will not affect any use or disclosure permitted by your authorization while it was in effect.

While the law permits us in certain circumstances to disclose your PHI to family, friends and others, we will do so only with your authorization. In the event you are unable to authorize such disclosure, but emergency or similar circumstances indicate that disclosure would be in your best interest, we may disclose your PHI to family, friends or others to the extent necessary to help with your health care coverage arrangements.

### Complaints / Violations

If you are concerned that we may have violated your privacy rights, you may inquire with us using the contact information listed on our privacy notice. You may also submit a written complaint to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We will provide you with the address for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services upon request. We support your right to protect the privacy of your PHI. We will not retaliate in any way if you choose to file a complaint with us or with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
