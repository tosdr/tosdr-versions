9\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
============================

Electronic transmissions, including the internet, are public media, and any use of such media is public and not private. Information related to or arising from such use is public, or the property of those collecting information, and not personal or private information.  
Services are provided to you as is. We expressly disclaim all warranties, representations, and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied  
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, design, accuracy, capability, sufficiency, suitability, capacity, completeness, availability, compatibility or arising from course of dealing or course of performance.

You assume the entire risk of loss of content and/or damage due to your use of services.  
If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding the release, then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this agreement, waive the applicability of California civil code section 1542, which states, “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” You hereby waive this section of the California civil code, and every similar provision in law, regulation, or code applicable in your jurisdiction with similar intent or effect as the aforementioned provision.

10\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
============================

Your use of services is entirely at your sole risk. Neither we nor our owners, directors, officers, employees, licensors, vendors, and/or agents shall be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages or losses (including without limitation loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses), whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, which you may incur in connection with the use of, or inability to use services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or loss.  
In the event we are held liable for any damages related to such matters, your sole and exclusive remedy will be limited to reimbursement for services or products paid by you to the entity held liable which were not provided by such entity. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claim or action related to such matters in any forum beyond one (1) year after the first occurrence of the kind of act, event, condition or omission upon which the claim or action is based.

11\. INDEMNIFICATION
====================

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Foundation and its employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and agents from and against any and all allegations, demands, claims, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties or costs of whatsoever nature (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), from or in any way related to (a) Your Content; (b) your use of the Services; (c) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (d) your violation of any third-party rights; (e) your violation of law; and/or (f) use of any services provided by third-party service providers. You may not settle or compromise any claim without our prior written consent. You shall cooperate with us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.

================

You may terminate your account and use of Services by notifying us at any time and closing your account for Services. Termination of your account may result in the immediate deletion of any or all of Your Content. We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. Upon termination, you must cease use of the Services and return all materials obtained from such us and all copies thereof, whether made under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. All provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation,  
ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution.

14\. ACCESSIBILITY
==================

We care about our community and strive to incorporate Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (“WCAG”) and other measures to assist with making Services user-friendly and accessible to visitors with disabilities. WCAG principles provide for website content to be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. We have a team of dedicated professionals who regularly evaluate Foundation Material in relation to WCAG’s recommendations and who accordingly assist with operationalizing the same. Not all WCAG principals are operational and you understand that the application and use of WCAG recommendations will vary based upon the dynamic nature of Foundation Material.  
Please contact us at the email or physical address or phone number in the Contacting Us section below (Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) for assistance with Services.

15\. THIRD PARTY LINKS
======================

Our Services and the Agreement contain links to other websites provided for your convenience. If you click a third-party link you will be directed to that third party’s website. The Foundation does not exercise control over third-party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, solicit personally identifiable information from you, or contain information you may find inappropriate or offensive. The Foundation’s Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you through our Services. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the  
Personal Data you submit to them. Please read the terms of use and privacy policies of the other websites you visit. The inclusion of any link to a website does not imply endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of the site’s privacy or information security policies or practices. Accordingly, if you decide to access a third-party website linked to on our Site, you do so at your own risk.

16\. PRIVACY
============

We collect and use information about you and your use of Services. Our Privacy Policy includes our Data Processing Agreement, which details more information on what information we collect and how such information may be used. Please review the Foundation’s [Privacy Policy](https://imaginationlibrary.com/privacy-policy/) for more information.

17\. COMMUNICATIONS
===================

By providing your email address to us or creating an account you consent to receive our newsletter, emails, and/or other communications from us regarding Services. You may unsubscribe from these communications at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link included in any email or by contacting us via email at [\[email protected\]](https://imaginationlibrary.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the word “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line.

18\. CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE
============================

The laws of the State of Tennessee, U.S.A. (without regard to its conflict of laws principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all transactions it contemplates,  
including, without limitations, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.

19\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION (PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY)
============================================================

(a) General. Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that this intended Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of, related to, or connected in any way to your use of Services, (collectively, “Dispute”), then you agree the Dispute shall  
be submitted to confidential arbitration in Knoxville, Tennessee, and you agree that all disputes will be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to choice of law principles. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”). Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorneys’ fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect our intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. You hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Tennessee. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court or tribunal with jurisdiction over the parties. As permitted by applicable law, you agree that any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of, related to, or connected in any way with your use of Services must be filed by you within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned. Any and all claims, judgments, and awards will be limited to actual third-party, out-of-pocket costs incurred (if any), but in no event will attorneys’ fees be awarded or recoverable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you understand that you are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court.

20\. NO CLASS ACTIONS
=====================

You and the foundation agree that any claims brought against each other must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, no arbitrator or court may consolidate more than one person’s claims, or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and may not award class-wide relief.

21\. SEVERABILITY; HEADINGS
===========================

In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it. If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, we shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force. Headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not be used in its construction and/or interpretation.

22\. NON-WAIVER
===============

We reserve all rights permitted to us under this Agreement, as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or applicable law will not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any other time.

23\. ASSIGNMENT
===============

We may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our sole discretion.

24\. CONTACT INFORMATION
