These third-party service providers are required not to use Personal Data we share other than to provide the Services requested by us. We will remain responsible to you for your Personal Data and work with third-party service providers to ensure their use of your Personal Data is consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### 7\. NON-PERSONAL DATA

The following are types of Non-Personal Data we may collect throughout Services, including through our Site:

a. Cookies. Cookies are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow Services to remember important information that will make your use of Services more convenient. Cookies will typically contain the name of the domain from which the Cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the Cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. We use Cookies in several ways, including:

i. Analytical Purposes. We use Cookies to analyze your use of our Services in order to improve the same. We may use Google Analytics or similar tools to help analyze how users use our Services. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often users visit our Site, what pages they visit, and what other websites they used prior to coming to our Site.

ii. User Preferences. We use Cookies to store certain preferences regarding your use of Services.

iii. Marketing. We use Cookies from and for third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for marketing purposes. These Cookies allow us to display promotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet.

iv. Device. We may use Cookies to remember your computing device when it is used to return to the Site to help customize your experience. We may associate Personal Data with a Cookie file in those instances.

b. Log Data. When you visit our Site, we automatically collect technical and statistical data about your visit, such as your browser type, internet service provider (ISP),referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data, the pages you visit and any search terms you use (“Log Data”). We will use and share Log Data for any purpose including industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.

c. Pixel Tags. We may use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that are used to track online movements of users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a readable format, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to

ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Personal Data.

d. IP Address. We also collect your public IP address when you visit our Site. We may use your public IP address in order to determine whether certain requests are fraudulent or frivolous and we may automatically cross-reference your public IP address with your domain name (usually the domain name of your ISP or employer). Because you may be visiting our Site from your personal residence, your IP address and any associated domain name are treated as “Personal Network

Information” instead of Personal Data. “Log Data” does not include Personal Network Information. Although such Personal Network Information may be used to administer and maintain Services, it is not shared with any third parties, except as described above in the sections titled “Third-Party Service Providers,” and “Other Disclosures.” Please note: depending on your jurisdiction your IP address may be considered personal data. In all such cases, it will be accordingly treated as such.

e. IP Address. We may use Non-Personal Data for any reason, including to: (i) administer our Site for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes; (ii) improve our Site to ensure content is presented in the manner most effective for you and for your device; (iii) allow you to participate in interactive features of our Site, when you choose to do so; (iv) as part of our efforts to keep our Site safe and secure.

### 8\. AGGREGATED DATA

After removing any personally identifying information from within the set of Personal Data, Personal Network Information, and Log Data we collect from you, we may combine that information with information we collect from other users and customers (collectively the “Aggregated Data”) in order to improve the quality and value of our Services and to analyze and understand how our Site is used. We may share Aggregated Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes.

### 9\. YOUR CHOICES

a. Access Your Information. You can access any of the Personal Data that we collect online and maintain it either online or by requesting access from us at the e-mail or regular mail address specified in the Contacting Us section below.

You may also opt out of providing us certain information in the following ways:

i. Google Analytics. You may opt out of Google Analytics by following this link.

An Authorized Adult may later view the child’s Personal Data and correct or remove the information, in whole or in part; instruct us to discontinue all use of the child’s Personal Data and/or not to communicate further with the child; or revoke or modify the consent, by contacting us at the e-mail or physical address in the Contacting Us section below and including the child’s name and email address and the parent or guardian’s name and email address.
