Privacy Policy.** When you sign up for our service, we will ask you to provide contact information such as your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and payment information such as credit card number and expiration date. This information will be stored in a protected database. If you contact us for customer support, we may ask you certain questions about your computer setup to better assist you. When you visit our Web site we will capture your IP Address, time of and duration of visit, and time and duration of the pages on our Web site that you view. We may tie this information to the personally identifiable information we have about you. Information we have on file will be used primarily for our services. We will never transfer or sell your information for inclusion on third party e-mail or other marketing lists. **18\. Service for Minors.** Users under the age of 18 are not allowed to sign up for our service. By agreeing to the Terms of Service, you agree that you are over the age of 18. Users under 18 may get a parent or guardian to sign up for them. By agreeing to the Terms of Service, you agree that you are over 18, and are able to legally enter a contract. Users under the age of 18 may be allowed to be the primary contact on an account providing that a parent or guardian is on the account and is the responsible party for said account. **19\. Sever ability.** A portion of this agreement deemed to be unenforceable, or illegal, will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary in order for this Agreement to remain in effect in accordance with its terms as modified by such reformation. **20\. Domain Names.** Clients who register domain names through Evolucix agree to the domain terms of service. These rules follow ICANN regulations and these terms. For clients who are registering or transferring a domain name, you must also agree to the Domain Name Registration Agreement below. Domains shall be renewed at the same price as new registrations. The current pricing is displayed on our website. Domain renewal reminders will be sent in advance of expiration via email to the address stored in your client area. Should an expired domain enter the redemption period, the cost of restoring the domain shall be no more than $30. Please note the following ICANN documents and policies - [Registrant Education Materials](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/educational) and [Registrants' Benefits and Responsibilities](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits). There are several reasons for these prohibitions on free services. The reasons include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  
a. First, free services generally do not require any reliable means of identifying the person who registers for them. As such, it can be practically impossible to track down persons who abuse the free services.  
b. Our customers, including (resellers) are all paying for prompt, reliable service and we have built a solid reputation for delivering excellent service to them. We cannot risk having unidentified persons damage our reputation.  
c. Users of free services are notorious for registering for free accounts and immediately spamming or otherwise consuming very large amounts of system resources and bandwidth before their accounts are shut down. Such abusers often register for successive or multiple accounts and cause many problems for the servers and network.  
d. Spammers, operators of phishing and pharming scams, distributors of spy ware, viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and other malware, operators of illegal Warez sites, operators of illegal or unauthorized file-swapping or archive sites, and hackers frequently abuse free online services. Allowing free services would expose our servers to severe abuse and could harm US/ all of our customers, and all the customers of our resellers.  
e. Free services lead to various forms of abuses that may violate criminal laws or even foster terrorist activities. Because such abuses violate applicable laws as well as our policies, we must prohibit them.  
If the Customer violates this prohibition on free services, we may suspend their account immediately, with or without notice, as we in our sole discretion deem necessary to address the situation.  
Additional Information. Evolucix reserves the right to request additional identification on any order. The request for additional identification will be sent to the customer before services are established  
This Agreement supersedes and replaces any prior understanding or communication, written or oral. This Agreement may be modified at any time with or without notice of Evolucix. **22\. Acceptable Use Policy. The acceptable use policy is contained beyond this point.** **1\.
