Foursquare privacy center
=========================

We make it easy for you to learn more about  
our data practices and how to exercise your privacy rights.

.

.

Data is a privilege
-------------------

As pioneers in location technology, we believe it is our duty and responsibility to set best practices related to data privacy and the ethical use of data. The data we collect powers our apps and location platform solutions for enterprises responsibly, always protecting user privacy.

#### Transparency, Notice & Choice

We know that location data is some of the most sensitive data out there. That’s why people must be in control of what personal data they share and how it is used. We empower our customers to make choices and exercise their rights.  
  
We believe that:   
• Mobile apps that want to collect location data need to ask permission from consumers in everyday language.  
• Consent should not be buried within terms and conditions.  
• Alerts should be clear and identify the purposes for which data will be used.  
• People should benefit from the collection of location data, so we only make our location technology available when there is a clear and legitimate use-case for location data.   
 

![Privacy Transparency](https://location.foursquare.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/tiles-privacy-transparency-control.png)

#### Privacy by Design

All of our products, services, applications, processes, and procedures are designed and built with privacy in mind. Our Privacy Team closely partners with our Product and Engineering teams to ensure that our products are embedded with privacy-protecting features

![Privacy Responsible](https://location.foursquare.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/2_Privacy-07-1.png)

#### Protecting sensitive places

We are committed to protecting against potential harms that may result from the abuse of location data, particularly around sensitive locations. In accordance with our long-standing internal policies, as well as our commitments under [NAI’s Precise Location Information Solution Provider Voluntary Enhanced Standards](https://thenai.org/accountability/precise-location-information-solution-provider-voluntary-enhanced-standards/), we maintain an inventory of sensitive location categories to ensure additional protections are in place to prevent the misuse of data associated with locations such as:   
  
• Places of worship;  
• Places primarily intended to be occupied by children;   
• Medical facilities catering to sensitive conditions (including women’s reproductive health clinics);  
• Domestic abuse shelters;  
• Military bases, and  
• Many other types of sensitive locations.

![Privacy Sensitive Places](https://location.foursquare.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/2_Privacy-05.png)

#### Call for Accountability

We are leading the call to action for accountability in our industry. Location technology can be a tool to serve the greater good, but regulation is needed to raise the bar. We are a vocal advocate for comprehensive federal privacy legislation to protect consumers from unethical, unfair, or opaque practices.

![Privacy Accountability](https://location.foursquare.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/2_Privacy-06.png)

Your privacy choices
--------------------

Foursquare knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We seek to be transparent about our data practices and give you control over your personal data.

**Cookies & similar technologies**
----------------------------------

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other devices. They are generally used to remember you and your preferences for one visit (through a “session cookie”) or multiple visits (using a “persistent cookie”).

![Cookies Privacy](https://location.foursquare.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/2_Privacy-04-1.png)

`Last Updated: April 05, 202`4

About cookies
-------------

This Cookie Policy should be read in connection with our privacy policy and our terms of use.

The cookies that we set are known as “first party cookies.” Cookies set by third parties, such as companies who serve content, provide advertising or perform analytics are known as “third party cookies.” You can learn more about cookies at [all about cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as web beacons or pixels. Web beacons and pixels are small blocks of code on web pages and in emails that enable us to perform analytics, and are often used in connection with cookies. However, web beacons and pixels are not stored in the same ways as cookies. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

Learn more about why Foursquare uses cookies and similar technologies in the following sections.

Strictly necessary cookies
--------------------------

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts may not function properly. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

Performance & analytics cookies
-------------------------------

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

Targeting cookies
-----------------

These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. These cookies are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.

Social media cookies
--------------------

These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.

Functional cookies
------------------

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.

Can cookies be turned off?
--------------------------

Most web browsers have an option to customize your cookie settings. For example, you can adjust your permission settings to block all cookies or only third party cookies. Please be aware that limiting the ability of websites to set cookies may worsen your overall user experience, and in some cases the services will not work properly without cookies, local storage, and similar technologies. Some web browsers incorporate “do not track” features. Currently, no industry standard exists for handling “do not track” requests, therefore at this time, we do not honor “do not track” browser signals.

Limited internet-based advertising
----------------------------------

To opt out of seeing interest-based ads from us or our third party advertising partners on various platforms, please follow these instructions:

**Desktop or Mobile Web Browser (US only)**. You may opt out of seeing interest-based ads from us or our third party advertising partners on your desktop browser and/or mobile web browser by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) [AdChoices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

**Connected TVs (US only)**. You may also opt out of seeing interest-based ads on TV streaming devices and connected TVs by visiting the NAI’s [Internet Connected TV Choices](https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/).

**Mobile Apps (US only)**. You may opt out of seeing mobile app interest-based ads and ad delivery/reporting by downloading the DAA’s AppChoices mobile application, which is available here:

– [DAA AppChoices iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870)  
– [DAA AppChoices Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en_US&gl=US)  
– [DAA AppChoices Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Advertising-Alliance-AppChoices/dp/B00SVQ4FMO)

When you opt out on a particular device, we will stop using and transferring data from that device for purposes of interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, other linked devices. Additionally, we will also stop using data coming from other linked devices for interest-based advertising on, and ad delivery/reporting to, the device from which the choice was exercised. If you use more than one device, you should opt out on each device. Certain versions of your device’s operating system permit you to opt out of interest-based advertising. Please visit your device settings to limit such tracking.

Please note that you will still see ads when you opt out of interest-based ads, but they will no longer be based on your interests or behavior. In addition, we may also continue to collect, use and transfer browser data for purposes other than interest-based advertising and ad delivery/reporting, as described in our privacy policies.

Google has also developed a web browser plugin to allow you to opt-out of Google Analytics’ tracking software. Visit [Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on (by Google)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en) to download.
