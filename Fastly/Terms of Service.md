**7\. Fees and Payment.**

**7.1 Fees.** Subscriber will pay all fees specified in Service Orders and provide accurate and updated billing contact information. Minimum commitments in Service Orders are (a) based on Services purchased and not actual usage; (b) non-cancelable; and (c) cannot be decreased during the specified term. Fees paid for minimum commitments and actual usage are not refundable. Subscriber’s payments of fees are neither (x) contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features nor (y) dependent on statements not set forth in the Agreement.

**7.2 Invoicing Terms.** If the Service Order specifies that payment will occur by a method other than a credit card, Subscriber will provide a purchase order number in the applicable amount (or reasonable alternative proof of Subscriber’s ability to pay the fees specified in a Service Order), and promptly notify Fastly of any changes necessary for payment of an invoice. Fastly will invoice Subscriber either monthly or according to the billing frequency stated in the Service Order. Invoices to be paid by credit card are due on the invoice date, all other invoices are due net 30 days from the invoice date. If any invoiced amount is not received by Fastly by the due date, then without limiting Fastly’s rights or remedies: (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, (b) Fastly may condition future subscription renewals and Service Orders on shorter payment terms or (c) provide a notice to Subscriber with a notice of non-renewal for all outstanding Service Orders. If Subscriber is paying for Services by credit card, Subscriber will provide Fastly with valid credit card information and promptly notify Fastly of any changes necessary to charge the credit card. The provision of credit card information to Fastly authorizes Fastly to charge the credit card for all Services specified in a Service Order, and any renewal subscription.

**7.3 Suspension of Service and Acceleration.** If any amount owing by Subscriber is 30 or more days overdue (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of invoices to be paid by credit card), Fastly may, without limiting any rights and remedies, accelerate Subscriber’s unpaid fee obligations to become immediately due and payable, not renew any Service Order, and suspend the provision of Services to Subscriber until the overdue amounts are paid in full. Fastly will give Subscriber at least 10 days’ prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with Section 18 (Manner of Giving Notice), before suspending services to Subscriber.

**7.4 Payment Disputes.** Fastly will not exercise any rights to suspend Services, accelerate payments, impose late charges or change payment terms under Section 7.2 (Invoicing Terms) with respect to an overdue amount for so long as Subscriber is disputing the overdue amount in good faith. The parties shall cooperate diligently to resolve the dispute.

**7.5 Refund or Payment upon Termination.** If Subscriber terminates the Agreement in accordance with Section 5.2 (Termination for Cause), Fastly will refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Service Orders after the effective date of termination. If the Agreement is terminated by Fastly in accordance with Section 5.2 (Termination for Cause), Subscriber will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Service Orders. In no event will termination relieve Subscriber of its obligation to pay any fees payable for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

**7.6 Taxes.** Fees for Services do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, **“Taxes”**). Subscriber is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its Service Orders. If Fastly is obligated by law to pay or collect Taxes for which Subscriber is responsible, Fastly will invoice Subscriber and Subscriber will pay that amount unless Subscriber can provide a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Subscriber will provide Fastly any information Fastly reasonably requests to determine whether Fastly is obligated to collect Taxes. Fastly is solely responsible for taxes assessable against its income, property, and employees.

**8\. Confidentiality.**

**8.1 Confidential Information.“Confidential Information”** means all information about the relationship created by the Agreement disclosed by a party (**“Discloser”**) to the other party (**“Recipient”**), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or, given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, should be understood to be confidential. Confidential Information of each party includes the terms and conditions of the Agreement and all Service Orders, including pricing, as well as business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed in connection with the Agreement.

**8.2 Protection of Confidential Information.** Except as provided in Section 8.3 (Compelled Disclosure) Recipient shall not disclose or otherwise make available any Confidential Information of the Discloser to anyone except those of its employees, attorneys, agents and consultants who: (a) need to know the Confidential Information in connection with the purpose of the Agreement and (b) who have previously agreed to be bound by confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those in the Agreement. Each party shall safeguard all Confidential Information of the other party with at least the same degree of care (but no less than reasonable care) as it uses to safeguard its own confidential information.

**8.3 Compelled Disclosure.** If the Recipient is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Discloser, then to the extent legally permitted, Recipient shall provide the Discloser with prior notice of the compelled disclosure and reasonable assistance, at Discloser’s cost, if the Discloser wishes to contest the compelled disclosure. Any compelled disclosure shall be limited to the extent required, and shall be subject to confidentiality protections to the extent practicable. If the Recipient is compelled by law to disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Discloser is a party, and the Discloser is not contesting the disclosure, the Discloser will reimburse the Recipient for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.

Without limiting Fastly’s obligations pursuant to Section 3 (Fastly’s Obligations), Subscriber’s exclusive remedies for a breach of a warranty in this Section 15.1 (Services Warranty) shall be (i) to the extent applicable, allow Fastly to repair or replace a non-conforming software component or (ii) to exercise the express rights described in Sections 5.2 (Termination for Cause) and 7.5 (Refund or Payment upon Termination), and to the extent applicable, to claim the credits set forth in the applicable SLA.

**15.2 Support and Professional Services Warranty.** The support and professional services specified in the applicable Service Order will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. Subscriber’s exclusive remedies for breach of the warranty in this Section 15.2 shall be either (a) re-performance of the Support or Professional Services by Fastly; (b) to claim the credits set forth in the applicable SLA; or (c) to exercise the express rights described in Sections 5.2 (Termination For Cause) and 5.5 (Refund or Payment upon Termination).

**15.3 Disclaimers.** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 15, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER IMPLIED, EXPRESS, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

**16\. Indemnification.**

**16.1 Indemnification by Fastly.** Fastly will indemnify and defend Subscriber against any and all third party claims, demands, suits or proceedings (each a **“Claim Against Subscriber”**) and all related judgments, liabilities, awards, damages, costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, arising out of or in connection with, or alleging the Services or use of the Services by Subscriber in accordance with the Agreement infringe or misappropriate the third party’s intellectual property rights, provided Subscriber (a) promptly gives Fastly written notice of the Claim Against Subscriber; (b) gives Fastly sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Subscriber (except that Fastly may not settle any Claim Against Subscriber unless it unconditionally releases Subscriber of all liability related to the Claim Against Subscriber); and (c) gives Fastly all reasonable assistance, at Fastly’s expense. If Fastly receives information about an infringement or misappropriation claim related to the Services, Fastly may in its discretion and at no cost to Subscriber (x) modify the Service so that it no longer infringes or misappropriates, without breaching Fastly’s obligations under Section 3 (Fastly’s Obligations); (y) obtain a license for Subscriber’s continued use of that Service in accordance with the Agreement; or (z) terminate Subscriber’s subscriptions for that Service upon 30 days’ written notice and refund Subscriber any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the terminated subscriptions. The above defense and indemnification obligations do not apply to a Claim Against Subscriber that result, in whole or in part, from Subscriber Data, a Non-Fastly Service, the use or combination of the Services with hardware, software, data, or processes not provided or specified by Fastly, if the Services or their use would not infringe third-party rights absent such combination, any intellectual property claim(s) known to Subscriber prior to its subscription to the Services, or Subscriber’s breach of the Agreement.

**16.2 Indemnification by Subscriber.** Subscriber will indemnify and defend Fastly against any and all third party claims, demands, suits or proceedings (each a **“Claim Against Fastly”**) and all related judgments, liabilities, awards, damages, costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, arising out of or in connection with (i) Subscriber Data, or (ii) Subscriber’s use of the Services in breach of the Agreement, provided Fastly (a) promptly gives Subscriber written notice of the Claim Against Fastly; (b) gives Subscriber sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Fastly (except that Subscriber may not settle any Claim Against Fastly unless it unconditionally releases Fastly of all liability related to the Claim Against Fastly); and (c) give Subscriber all reasonable assistance, at Subscriber’s expense. The above defense and indemnification obligations do not apply to a Claim Against Fastly that result, in whole or in part, from the Services or Fastly’s breach of the Agreement. Except with respect to a dispute between Subscriber and Fastly, Subscriber will reimburse Fastly for all costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees for responding to third party or governmental requests for information arising out of or in connection with Subscriber Data or Subscriber’s use of the Services.

**16.3 Additional Indemnified Parties.** For purposes of this Section 16, (a) a Claim Against Fastly shall include a claim against Fastly, Fastly’s Affiliates, and Fastly’s or its Affiliates’ officers, directors, and employees and (b) a Claim Against Subscriber shall include a third-party claim against Subscriber, Subscriber’s Affiliates, and Subscriber’s or its Affiliates’ officers, directors, and employees; provided no indemnified party shall be entitled to any form of equitable or implied indemnification at any time.

**16.4 Exclusive Remedy.** This Section 16 states the indemnifying party’s sole liability to, and the indemnified party’s exclusive remedy against, the other party for any type of claim described in this Section 16.

**17\. Assignment.**

**17.1** Either party may assign the Agreement in its entirety, without the other party’s consent (a) to its Affiliate or (b) in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, unless the Subscriber is acquired by, sells substantially all of its assets to, or undergoes a change of control in favor of, a direct competitor of Fastly, in which case Fastly may, but is not required to, terminate the Agreement upon written notice, and in the event of such a termination, Fastly will refund to Subscriber any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the initial term of all Service Orders.

**17.2** Except as permitted in Section 17.1, neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

**17.3** The Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors, and permitted assigns.

**18\. Manner of Giving Notice.**

**18.1 Updates.** All updates to the Documentation will be posted to [http://docs.fastly.com/changes](http://docs.fastly.com/changes), and may be subscribed for using email or rich site summary or a successor protocol (**“RSS”**). Posted updates to (a) the AUP or (b) the Documentation that reflect (i) a reduction in the features, functionality or performance of the Services, (ii) changes to the Security Measures or (iii) a significant increase in Subscriber’s obligations (**“Significant Updates”**) may be separately subscribed for using email or RSS. Updates to the Documentation will be effective upon posting; provided, these updates shall not limit the warranties made by Fastly in Section 15.1 as of the start of the term of a Service Order. Updates to the AUP will be effective thirty (30) days after posting.

**18.2** Except as otherwise specified in the Agreement, all notices, permissions and approvals shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon (a) personal delivery; (b) the second business day after mailing; or (c) the first business day after sending by email (provided email shall not be sufficient for notices of an indemnifiable claim). Billing-related notices to Subscriber shall be addressed to the relevant billing contact designated by Subscriber. All other notices to Subscriber shall be addressed to the relevant Services system administrator or other person designated by Subscriber in writing, or, if applicable, as set forth on the Cover Page to the Agreement. Notices to Fastly should be addressed to gc@fastly.com or Fastly, Inc. Attn: General Counsel, PO Box 78266, San Francisco, CA 94107.

**19\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.** The governing law of California and controlling United States federal law will apply in any lawsuit arising out of or in connection with the Agreement and the Federal or state courts located in San Francisco, California, USA have exclusive jurisdiction over any such lawsuit. The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.

**20\. Relationship of the Parties.** The parties are independent contractors. The Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties.

**21\. Third-Party Beneficiaries.** Subscriber acknowledges that Fastly’s licensors and technology providers have required Fastly to agree to certain provisions with Subscriber, including Sections 4 (Subscriber’s Obligations), 9 (Licenses and Proprietary Rights), 13 (Limitation on Liability), 14 (Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages) and 16 (Indemnification). There are no third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement, AUP or the Documentation.

**22\. Authorized Reseller.** If Subscriber has validly purchased Services through a reseller authorized by Fastly (an **“Authorized Reseller”**) under an ordering document that binds the Subscriber to the terms of this Agreement (a **“Reseller Order”**), then Fastly will make the validly purchased Services specified in the Reseller Order available to Subscriber.  Fastly may share information regarding Subscriber with the Authorized Reseller when necessary for providing the Services or as needed for the Authorized Reseller to perform services for the benefit of Subscriber.  A Reseller Order shall be a Service Order for purposes of this Agreement, provided that, (a) Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.6 of this Agreement shall not apply; (b) Fastly will seek payment for all fees associated with Subscriber’s use of the Services from the Authorized Reseller, (c) any refunds or credits will be issued to the Authorized Reseller; (d) if any amount owing by an Authorized Reseller for Subscriber’s use of the Services is overdue, Fastly may, without limiting any rights and remedies, suspend the provision of Services to Subscriber until the overdue amounts are paid in full; (e) amounts paid by Subscriber to the Authorized Reseller for Services subscribed for by Subscriber shall be deemed to be payments made by Subscriber hereunder for purposes of Section 13 (Limitation of Liability); and (f) a Reseller Order cannot modify or take precedence over the Data Processing Terms, the Agreement, the AUP, or the Documentation.

**23\. Entire Agreement.** The Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following, the order of precedence shall be: (i) the Data Processing Terms, (ii) the applicable Service Order (other than a Reseller Order), (iii) the Agreement, (iv) the AUP and (v) the Documentation. Fastly and Subscriber each represent that it has validly entered into the Agreement and has the legal power to do so. Any term or condition stated in a Subscriber online supplier portal click-through, purchase order or other Subscriber order documents (excluding Service Orders) is void. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of the Agreement will be effective unless it exists in writing and is signed by the party against whom the modification, amendment, or waiver is to be asserted. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the Agreement will constitute a waiver of that right. If any provision of the Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in effect.
