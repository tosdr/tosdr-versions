**Privacy Policy**
==================

**Published on**: October 27, 2024

**1\. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE**
------------------------------

This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) covers and describes how Fastly, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Fastly”, “We” or “Us”) collect, use, share, secure and disclose the personal data we collect from individuals who interact with www.fastly.com and our websites that link to this Privacy Policy or who initiate communications with us (“Visitors”), individuals who sign-up for and register for products and services (“Customers”), individuals who register to use our products and services on behalf of a Customer (“Users”) individuals who register for or attend our marketing events or receive our marketing emails (“Attendees”) and individuals who submit an application for a career opportunity at Fastly (“Job Applicants”). 

Our websites, apps, and services are designed for businesses and their representatives. We do not target consumers – individuals who seek to use products and services for their personal or household use.  Accordingly, we treat all personal data we collect as pertaining to individuals in their business capacity and not their individual capacity.

**Fastly as a Data Processor or Service Provider.**

In their use of our products and services, Customers and their Users may submit content, configurations and credentials to Fastly to be processed. The security and privacy practices governing our Customers’ (and our Customers’ Internet clients’) use of our services and how we store, process, transmit and disclose the data submitted to the services by our Customers are described in and governed by our service contracts with our Customers. Our terms of service are available [here](https://www.fastly.com/terms). Our data processing terms are available [here](https://www.fastly.com/data-processing). To the extent a Customer submits to the services the personal data of European persons (including the United Kingdom and Switzerland) or other persons who are protected by similar data privacy laws, Fastly processes that personal data as a data processor or as the Customer’s sub-processor (as the case may be). Customers are solely responsible for establishing the policies governing, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to, the Customer’s (and the Customer’s Internet client’s) collection and submission of personal data to our services. Any personal data about an individual (i.e., a “data subject”) hosted, stored, or published by a Customer is the responsibility of the Customer and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

Fastly acknowledges that you may have the right to access your personal data. Fastly has no direct relationship with the data subjects whose personal data we process on behalf of our Customers. An individual who seeks to access, correct, amend, or delete personal data about them that we process on behalf of our Customers should direct their requests or queries to our Customer (i.e., the data controller). In addition, we will forward to the applicable Customer any request by a data subject received by Fastly regarding personal data processed on behalf of that Customer.

**Fastly as a Data Controller** 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand the categories and specific pieces of personal data we collect and how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal data of our Visitors, Customers, Users, Attendees, and Job Applicants, as well as the choices available to you regarding that information.  

**International Data Transfers** 

When Fastly operates as a data controller (i.e., when we determine the manner, purposes and means of the processing of others’ personal information), Fastly may collect from, transfer to, or process, and store your personal information in the United States and other countries other than the country where you live. When we transfer personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or UK to any other country, we will do so according to an adequate mechanism of transfer as required by applicable laws or regulations.

**Data Privacy Framework Notice**

Fastly complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Fastly has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  
  
Fastly has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  
  
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)

If you are located in the EU, UK or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the personal data that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend or delete your personal data if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Frameworks' principles. We will give you an opportunity to opt out where personal data we control about you is to be disclosed to an independent third party or used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us via the details provided below.

In compliance with the Framework,  Fastly commits to resolve DPF principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing abuse@fastly.com or via mail to: Fastly, Inc. 475 Brennan St #300, San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer. We will respond to your inquiry within 45 days of receipt and verification of your identity.

In addition Fastly commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to the EU DPA Panel, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the European Union. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request) for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPA Panel are provided at no cost to you.

If your DFP complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, you may invoke binding arbitration for residual claims not fully or partially resolved by other redress mechanisms. For more detailed information about binding arbitration, visit the Data Privacy Framework website, found [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/G%E2%80%93Arbitration-Procedures).

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Fastly’s  compliance with the Frameworks.  We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the Frameworks in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Fastly is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the Frameworks’ principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Fastly shall remain liable under the Frameworks' principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Frameworks’ principles unless Fastly proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**2\. FASTLY COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**
---------------------------------------------------------

### **2.1. What categories and specific types of personal data does Fastly collect?**

Information that we collect from or about you includes the following:

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

| **Categories of collected personal data** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Identification and Contact Information | Details such as name, postal address, e-mail address, or telephone number, either actively or passively, and billing information such as credit card number and tax address. |

Information you provide as a contributing user that is published or displayed (hereafter, referred to as “posted”) on public areas of our websites, or transmitted to other users of our websites or third parties. Your user contributions are posted and may be accessed by others at your own risk. Information you provide when applying for a job with Fastly, including your résumé. |

We do not collect any information about criminal convictions and offenses.

**Legal Basis and Purpose for Processing Personal Data** 

Where we process personal data as a processor or a service provider pursuant to service contracts with our Customers, we only process personal data on the instructions of the Customer, and only as necessary, appropriate and customary to provide our services.

If you are an individual located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or an individual whose personal data is protected by laws similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), our legal basis and purpose for collecting and using the personal data described above in this Section 2.1 will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where: (a) we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

**Examples of Legitimate Basis and Purpose for Collecting Your Personal Data**

In connection with your use of our services, we collect and process personal data to perform our contractual obligations related to the services that you have requested. Where we collect personal data in connection with operating our websites and services, we have a legitimate interest in ensuring our websites, services and associated networks and IT systems operate properly and securely. Where you have requested to receive information about our products, services and business or other marketing communications, then we process personal data based upon our legitimate interest in engaging in direct marketing with Visitors, Customers, Users, Attendees, individuals and companies that have requested to receive information from us. 

Where you have responded to a job posting on our websites, we collect and process personal data as part of our consideration of your application. Where we rely on your consent to process the personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal. 

Where we collect data about online behavior, including through the use of cookies, we have a legitimate interest in providing you with an optimal user experience and understanding and analyzing how Visitors interact with our website. You can find more about the use of cookies in our websites, please read and review our Cookie Policy found [here](https://www.fastly.com/cookies).

In connection with operating our global caching network’s general interaction with the Internet, Fastly collects client IP address information on a limited basis to provide and improve its services.

-------------------------------------------------------

### **3.1 Does Fastly share my personal data with others?**

**Third-Party Service Providers**

We engage third-party service providers in the operation of our business or to support our business. We consequently share information, including personal data, with these contracted third-party service providers in connection with using their services. These include cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools, customer relations management, security tools, staffing service providers, backup, storage, payment processing, analytics and other services. We also engage and share information with third-party service providers for fraud protection, credit risk reduction and payment collection associated with our accounts. Our service providers may have access to, process or store your personal data for the purpose of providing us with their contracted-for services. 

Our service providers are not authorized to process your personal data for purposes other than as necessary, appropriate or reasonable to provide the service we have purchased.

**Compliance with Laws; Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Our Rights**

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet law enforcement requirements.

**Corporate Events**

We may share your personal data to a potential buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Fastly’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal data held by Fastly about our websites users is among the assets transferred. We may also share your personal data with potential investors, financing sources, auditors or agents that may conduct due diligence of our business. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our websites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.

Some content or applications are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers who may collect your information as you interact with those parties through our websites.

This collection can occur under the following circumstances:

* When you log in to our websites using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.
    
* When you use social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.

These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.
    
* You can log in to our websites using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our websites to your profile page to share with others within your network.

They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.

### **3.3 Data Supplementation**

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal data about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. If we receive personal data about you from a third party in order to engage in marketing of our services, then we will market to you only in your capacity as representatives of companies we wish to sell to and we will present you an opportunity to opt-out of future communications.

Examples of the types of personal data that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include:

* Contact information about you, including your name, email address telephone number, from third party sources to verify your address so we can properly prevent fraud or communicate with you; or
    
* Data purchased from third parties, such as social networking sites and conference attendee lists, that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products. If you receive a marketing communication or promotion from us, you may opt-out of these communications at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link provided in the email or by sending a request to abuse@fastly.com.

-------------------------------------

### **5.1 How does Fastly protect my information and data?**

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.

Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any sensitive information is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) (sometimes referred to as Secure Sockets Layer or SSL).

You must also make sure that your personal data is safe and secure. Even if we give you (or you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Do not share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our websites, for example, message boards. The personal data you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our websites.

Information that is transmitted via the Internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our websites. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk. We are not responsible if you circumvent any privacy settings or security measures on our websites.

### **5.2 How does Fastly limit access to my personal data?**

We limit access to certain pages on our websites and allow you to set certain privacy settings via your account profile; however, be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
