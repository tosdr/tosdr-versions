Your renewed or continued use of the Services represents your consent to our processing of your Personal Data (including Sensitive Data) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy or wish to revoke your consent to our processing of your Personal Data, please email us at [privacy@FatSecret.com](mailto:privacy@fatsecret.com).**<br><br>  <br><br>1. **Introduction**<br>    <br>    This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products and services offered by Secret Industries Pty Ltd (FatSecret) including through its [mobile applications](https://www.fatsecret.com/connected) (the **FatSecret App**), [websites](https://www.fatsecret.com/Default.aspx?pa=sites) and [Platform](https://platform.fatsecret.com/) (all together **"FatSecret"**, **"we"**, **"us"** or **"our"**). FatSecret is an online diet, nutrition and weight loss community service that allows users to set up unique user profiles, track their activity, food and weight and contribute information and content to help people achieve their diet, nutrition and weight goals (collectively, the **Services**). We also provide paid services (**Premium Service**) where users have access to further personalised educational content, meal plans and other features which are only accessible within the Premium Service. Where we use the term "Services" in this Privacy Policy it includes "Premium Services", where applicable.<br>    <br>    We understand the importance of protecting the privacy of your Personal Data and take appropriate reasonable steps to protect it. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain what Personal Data we collect about you when you interact with FatSecret, including what Personal Data and other information we collect, how we use that information, with whom we share that information and what steps we take to protect that information.<br>    <br>    FatSecret servers are hosted in multiple locations, including Europe and the United States and if you are accessing FatSecret from outside the United States, please be advised that you may be transferring your Personal Data to the United States and that the United States may have data protection laws/standards that are different from where you live. Your continued use of FatSecret represents your consent to this transfer of information.<br>    <br>    **Personal Data** is information relating to you that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly, alone or together with other information (particularly by reference to an identifier). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term **Personal Data** encompasses the definition of "Personal Data" under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (**GDPR**) as well as the definitions of "personal data", "personal information" or other like terms applicable under the privacy laws where we carry on business. Unless specifically noted otherwise, when the term "Personal Data" is used in this Privacy Policy it includes "Sensitive Data".<br>    <br>    **Sensitive Data** is a category of Personal Data and encompasses the definition of "special categories of personal data" under the GDPR as well as the definitions of "sensitive data", "sensitive information" and other like terms applicable under the privacy laws where we carry on business.
