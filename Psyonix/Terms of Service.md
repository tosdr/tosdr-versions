10. ‌VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS
    
      
    
    If a Game allows you to purchase and/or earn through play a license to use Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods (as defined below), the following additional terms and conditions apply.
    
      
    
    1. The Games may enable users to (i) use fictional virtual currency as a medium of exchange exclusively within each such Game (“Virtual Currency” or “VC”); (ii) gain access to (and certain limited rights to use) virtual goods within the Game (“Virtual Goods” or “VG”); and (iii) barter or exchange VC and VG with other users of the Game. Regardless of the terminology used, VC and VG represent a limited license right governed by these Terms. Subject to the terms of and compliance with these Terms, Psyonix hereby grants you the nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited and revocable right and license to use VC and VG obtained by you for your personal non-commercial gameplay exclusively within the Games. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, VC and VG obtained by you are licensed to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to VC and VG is being transferred or assigned hereunder. These Terms should not be construed as a sale of any rights in VC and VG.
        
          
        
        VC and VG do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. You are prohibited from converting VC and VG into a unit of value outside of the Games, such as actual currency or actual goods. You acknowledge and agree that Psyonix may revise or take action that impacts the perceived value of or purchase price for any VC and/or VG at any time except as prohibited by applicable law. VC and VG do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to VC and VG will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the Games’ documentation, when Psyonix ceases providing the Services, or these Terms are otherwise terminated. Psyonix, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use VC or VG and/or may distribute VC or VG with or without charge.
        
          
        
    2. You may have the ability to purchase VC or to earn VC from Psyonix for the completion of certain activities or accomplishments in the Games. For example, Psyonix may provide VC or VG upon the completion of an in-Game activity, such as attaining a new level, completing a task, or creating user content. Once obtained, VC and/or VG will be credited to your user account (“**User Account**”). You may purchase VC and VG only within the Games, or through a platform, participating third-party online store, application store, or other store authorized by Psyonix (all referred to herein as “**Software Store**”). Purchase and use of in-Game items or currency through a Software Store are subject to the Software Store’s governing documents, including but not limited to these Terms. This online service has been sublicensed to you by the Software Store. Psyonix may offer discounts or promotions on the purchase of VC, and such discounts and promotions may be modified or discontinued by Psyonix at any time without notice to you. Upon completing an authorized purchase of VC from a Software Store, the amount of purchased VC will be credited to your User Account. Psyonix shall establish
        
        a maximum amount you may spend to purchase VC per transaction and/or per day, which may vary depending on the associated Software. Psyonix, in its sole discretion, may impose additional limits on the amount of VC you may purchase or use, how you may use VC, and the maximum balance of VC that may be credited to your User Account. You are solely responsible for all VC purchases made through your User Account regardless of whether or not authorized by you.
        
          
        
    3. You can access and view your available VC and VG in your User Account when logged into your User Account. Psyonix reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the available VC and VG in your User Account. Psyonix further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the amount of and manner in which VC is credited and debited from your User Account in connection with your purchase of VG or for other purposes. While Psyonix strives to make all such calculations on a consistent and reasonable basis, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Psyonix’s determination of the available VC and VG in your User Account is final, unless you can provide documentation to Psyonix that such calculation was or is intentionally incorrect.
        
          
        
    4. All purchased in-Game Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods may be consumed or lost by players in the course of gameplay according to the Game rules applicable to currency and goods, which may vary depending on the associated Game. VC and VG may only be used within the Games, and Psyonix, in its sole discretion, may limit use of VC and/or VG to a single Game. The authorized uses and purposes of VC and VG may change at any time. Your available VC and/or VG as shown in your User Account will be reduced each time you use VC and/or VG within the Games. The use of any VC and/or VG constitutes a demand against and withdrawal from your available VC and/or VG in your User Account. You must have sufficient available VC and/or VG in your User Account in order to complete a transaction within the Games. VC and/or VG in your User Account may be reduced without notice upon the occurrence of certain events related to your use of the Games. You are responsible for all uses of VC and/or VG made through your User Account, regardless of whether or not authorized by you. You must notify Psyonix immediately upon discovering the unauthorized use of any VC and/or VG made through your User Account by submitting a request
        
        [to](https://support.rocketleague.com/) support.rocketleague.com.
        
          
        
    5. VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods and services. You may not sell, lease, license, or rent VC or VG. VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-Game goods or services and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value or other goods from Psyonix or any other person or entity at any time, except as expressly provided herein or otherwise required by applicable law. VC and VG have no cash value, and neither Psyonix nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange your VC or VG for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency.
        
          
        
    6. All purchases of VC and VG are final and such purchases will not be refundable, transferable, or exchangeable except as required by law. Except as prohibited by
        
        applicable law, Psyonix has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify, suspend, and/or eliminate such VC and/or VG as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and Psyonix shall have no liability to you or anyone else for the exercise of such rights.
        
          
        
    7. Any transferring, trading, selling, or exchanging of any VC or VG to anyone, other than in gameplay using the Games as expressly authorized by Psyonix (“**Unauthorized Transactions**”), including, but not limited to, among other users of the Services, is not sanctioned by Psyonix and is strictly forbidden. Psyonix reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate, suspend, or modify your User Account and your VC and VG and terminate these Terms if you engage in, assist in, or request any Unauthorized Transactions. All users who participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Psyonix, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from such actions. You acknowledge that Psyonix may request that the applicable Software Store stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue, or reverse any Unauthorized Transaction, regardless of when such Unauthorized Transaction occurred (or has yet to occur) when it suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of these Terms, violations of any applicable law or regulation, or any intentional act designed to interfere or that otherwise has the effect of or may have the effect of intervening in any way with the operation of the Services. If Psyonix believes or has any reason to suspect that you have engaged in an Unauthorized Transaction, you further agree that Psyonix may, in its sole discretion, restrict your access to your available VC and VG in your User Account or terminate or suspend your User Account and your rights to any VC, VG, and other items associated with your User Account.
        
          
        
    8. VC is only available to customers in certain locations. You may not purchase or use VC if you are not in an approved location.

Any such program, including the eligibility and selection of users, the award, compensation or other benefit to be granted users, if any, and the duration, shall be at the sole and absolute discretion of Psyonix. You acquire no right or interest to participate in such program or to the impartial implementation of the program and distribution of any awards, compensation or benefits. You hereby expressly waive and disclaim any such right or interest. To the extent such program may involve one or more third parties and permitted by applicable law, you further expressly waive and disclaim any such right or interest against such third party. Psyonix may elect in its sole and absolute discretion to contact you with regard to a program or tournament.

15. ‌LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW
    
      
    
    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PSYONIX (AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON, WHETHER UNDER CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, AND/OR

16. ‌INDEMNIFICATION
    
      
    
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Psyonix, its officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt,and expenses (including but not limited to attorney fees) arising from your use of the Services, your violation of any of the Terms, your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, trade secret, privacy or property right, or any claim that your User-Generated Content caused damage to a third-party.
    
      
    
17. BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION
    
      
    
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND DISCOVERY PROCEDURES AND APPELLATE RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT.
    
      
    
    The term “**Dispute** ” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Psyonix arising from or relating to the Terms or Services, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section 17 (with the exception of the enforceability of the requirement that arbitrations must be conducted on an individual rather than a class basis). The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a Dispute with Psyonix or Psyonix’s officers, directors, employees and agents that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the “Notice of Dispute” clause below, then you and Psyonix agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only as follows:
    
      
    
    * If you are using or accessing the Services outside of the European Union, through binding arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 17. “Binding arbitration” means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
        
          
        
    * If (and only if) you are using or accessing the Services in the European Union, then pursuant to the terms of Section 20 below.
        
          
        
        [RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS: IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION 17, YOU MUST NOTIFY PSYONIX IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT THESE TERMS UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE EITHER (A) SENT VIA EMAIL TO](mailto:LEGAL@PSYONIX.COM) LEGAL@PSYONIX.COM OR (B) MAILED TO PSYONIX LLC, AT: 401
        
        W. A STREET, SUITE 2400, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA 92101-7909 USA, ATTN: LEGAL/ARBITRATION. IN EITHER CASE YOU MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME,
        
        (2) YOUR ADDRESS, AND (3) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH PSYONIX THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION.
        
          
        
        Notice of Dispute/Informal Resolution. [IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH PSYONIX YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE EITHER BY (A) SENDING AN EMAIL TO](mailto:LEGAL@PSYONIX.COM) LEGAL@PSYONIX.COM OR (B) WRITING TO PSYONIX LLC, AT: 401 W. A STREET, SUITE 2400, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-7909 USA, ATTN: LEGAL/ARBITRATION, TO GIVE PSYONIX THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY
        
        THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute.
        
          
        
        The notice of Dispute sent by either party must include the sender’s name, address, and other contact information, a description of the Dispute (including any relevant account names), and what resolution to the Dispute is being sought. All applicable statutes of limitations will be considered tolled beginning on the day one of us sends a compliant Notice of Dispute to the other. You or Psyonix cannot proceed to arbitration without having first sent a compliant Notice of Dispute and completing the Informal Resolution period. In the event of disagreements over whether a compliant Notice of Dispute was sent or an arbitration was filed without completing this informal resolution process, the party aggrieved by this failure can seek relief from a court with appropriate jurisdiction to enjoin the arbitration from proceeding until this informal resolution has been completed, and to order the party that has not followed the informal resolution process to reimburse the other party for any arbitration fees and costs already incurred. If Psyonix does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of a compliant notice of the Dispute, you or Psyonix with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 17.
        
          
        
        Coordinated Filings. If 25 or more notices of Disputes are sent that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “Coordinated Cases” and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Cases are sought to be filed in arbitration as set forth in this Agreement. Psyonix or you may advise the other of its or your belief that cases are Coordinated Cases, and disputes over whether a case or cases meet the contractual definition of “Coordinated Cases” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. Demands for Arbitration in Coordinated Cases shall only be filed with the arbitration provider as permitted by the bellwether process set forth below. Claimants in Coordinated Cases will be responsible for their share of the NAM fees. Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for claims asserted in a Coordinated Case from the time a compliant Notice of Dispute has been received by a party until, under the terms of this Agreement, the Coordinated Case is filed in arbitration or, as provided for below, in court.
        
        Once counsel in the Coordinated Cases has advised Psyonix that all or substantially all Notices of Dispute have been provided for those cases, counsel for the parties shall confer in good faith regarding the number of cases that should proceed in arbitration as “bellwethers,” to allow each side a reasonable opportunity to test the merits of its arguments. If counsel for the parties do not agree on the number of bellwethers, an even number shall be chosen by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter (or, in the arbitration provider’s discretion, by a process arbitrator). Factors that the arbitration provider may consider in deciding how many bellwether trials to order include the complexity of the dispute and differences in facts or applicable laws among various cases. Once the number of bellwethers is fixed, by agreement or by the arbitration provider, each side shall select half that number from among the claimants who have provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and **only** those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. No other cases may be filed until those bellwether matters have concluded, and Psyonix may not be required to pay any fees associated with arbitration demands other than those permitted to be filed as bellwethers. The parties acknowledge that resolution of Coordinated Cases not selected as bellwethers will be delayed by this bellwether process.
        
        Unless the parties agree otherwise, each bellwether trial should be assigned to a different arbitrator, only bellwether trials will proceed in arbitration.
        
        Once all bellwether trials have concluded (or sooner if the counsel for the claimants and Psyonix agree) the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Cases, with each side paying half the applicable mediation fee. Psyonix and counsel for the claimants must agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether trial. If counsel for Psyonix and claimants cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. Psyonix and counsel for the claimants will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.
        
        If the mediation does not yield a global resolution, this arbitration requirement shall no longer apply to Disputes that are the subject of Coordinated Cases for which a compliant Notice of Dispute was received by the other party but that were not resolved in bellwether proceedings. To the extent you are asserting the same claims as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. If a formerly arbitrable Dispute is brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in the Coordinated Cases who provided compliant Notices of Dispute. Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis. A court with appropriate jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this bellwether process and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.
        
        Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FOR ANY DISPUTE NOT SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE (EXCEPT TO THE LIMITED EXTENT DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR COORDINATED CASES), YOU AND PSYONIX AGREE TO ONLY BRING DISPUTES, CLAIMS, OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND PSYONIX THAT RELATES TO ANY PSYONIX PRODUCT OR PSYONIX PRODUCTS GENERALLY, YOUR USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF A PSYONIX PRODUCT, OR THESE TERMS, IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND SHALL NOT SEEK TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, COLLECTIVE OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER ACTION WHERE ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY (E.G., PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS; OR CONSOLIDATE OR COMBINE INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS OR PERMIT ANOTHER TO DO SO WITHOUT THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. YOU AND PSYONIX FURTHER AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
        
          
        
        Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. [If you or Psyonix elect to resolve your Dispute through binding arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), https://namadr.com, according to NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Dispute arises (the “Rules”), as modified by this Agreement. Instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by emailing NAM at](mailto:commercial@namadr.com) commercial@namadr.com. This Agreement affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law. The terms of this Section 17 govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties. You will send a copy of any Demand for Arbitration to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Psyonix will send any Demand for Arbitration to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.
        
          
        
        Arbitration Procedures. Subject to these Terms, any Dispute shall be finally settled in English, in accordance with the Rules, by one commercial arbitrator, who shall be selected in accordance with the Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with Psyonix as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’
        
        fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to Psyonix or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
        
          
        
        Location of Arbitration. If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in San Diego, California, USA, or where you reside; you choose.
        
          
        
        Severability. If all or any provision of this Section 17 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then you and Psyonix agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of the agreement shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the prohibition on class arbitrations is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you and Psyonix agree that it will not be severable; this entire Section 17 (except for the Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver provisions) will be void and unenforceable, and any Dispute will be resolved in court. Under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Psyonix’s express consent.
        
          
        
        Future Arbitration Changes. Although Psyonix may revise these Terms in its discretion, Psyonix does not have the right to alter the terms of arbitration or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises, if such change would make arbitration procedures less favorable to the claimant. Whether changed procedures are less favorable to the claimant is an issue to be decided by the arbitrator, and if multiple claimants are proceeding in Coordinated Cases, the applicability of revised terms to the Coordinated Cases will be decided by the arbitration provider as a process matter.

    For any notice of infringement to be effective, the notice must include:
    
      
    
    * (a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the intellectual property owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
        
    * (b) A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon;
        
    * (c) A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Services;

    * (f) A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information in the notification is accurate and that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
        
          
        
        It is Psyonix’s policy to block access to or remove content that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any user or other content provider, and remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. If you believe that User-Generated Content or other material residing on or accessible through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement to the Designated Agent. The notice of infringement should conform to the elements of notification listed above. Once proper infringement notification is received by the Designated Agent, Psyonix may remove or disable access to the claimed infringing User-Generated Content or other material; notify the accused infringing party that it has removed or disabled access to the User-Generated Content or other material; and determine appropriate measures to prevent recurrence by the accused infringing party.
        
          
        
        If the accused infringing party believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or s/he believes that s/he has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, s/he may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
        
          
        
    * (a) A physical or electronic signature of the accused infringing party;
        
    * (b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
        
    * (c) A statement that the accused infringing party has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and
        
    * (d) The accused infringing party’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the accused infringing party’s address is located, or, if that party’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Psyonix is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
        
    
      
    
    If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Psyonix may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person
    
    that Psyonix may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Psyonix’s discretion.
