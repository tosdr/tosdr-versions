Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, VC and VG obtained by you are licensed to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to VC and VG is being transferred or assigned hereunder. These Terms should not be construed as a sale of any rights in VC and VG.

VC and VG do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. You are prohibited from converting VC and VG into a unit of value outside of the Games, such as actual currency or actual goods. You acknowledge and agree that Psyonix may revise or take action that impacts the perceived value of or purchase price for any VC and/or VG at any time except as prohibited by applicable law. VC and VG do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the license granted hereunder to VC and VG will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the Games’ documentation, when Psyonix ceases providing the Services, or these Terms are otherwise terminated. Psyonix, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use VC or VG and/or may distribute VC or VG with or without charge.

All users who participate in such activities do so at their own risk and hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless Psyonix, its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents from all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from such actions. You acknowledge that Psyonix may request that the applicable Software Store stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue, or reverse any Unauthorized Transaction, regardless of when such Unauthorized Transaction occurred (or has yet to occur) when it suspects or has evidence of fraud, violations of these Terms, violations of any applicable law or regulation, or any intentional act designed to interfere or that otherwise has the effect of or may have the effect of intervening in any way with the operation of the Services.

If Psyonix does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you or Psyonix with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 17.

**Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PSYONIX SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS. THE WAIVER IN RELATION TO YOUR PARTICIPATION IN CLASS ACTIONS IN THESE TERMS IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT SUCH WAIVER IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.**

**Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.** If you or Psyonix elect to resolve your Dispute through binding arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (JAMS), www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section 17 govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.

**Arbitration Procedures.** Because the software and/or service provided to you by Psyonix concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA“) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any Disputes. Subject to these Terms, any Dispute shall be finally settled in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with Psyonix as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to Psyonix or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

**Location of Arbitration.** You or Psyonix may initiate arbitration in San Diego, California, USA.

**Severability of Class Action Waiver.** If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 17 will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court and you and Psyonix each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.

If you believe that User-Generated Content or other material residing on or accessible through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement to the Designated Agent. The notice of infringement should conform to the elements of notification listed above. Once proper infringement notification is received by the Designated Agent, Psyonix may remove or disable access to the claimed infringing User-Generated Content or other material; notify the accused infringing party that it has removed or disabled access to the User-Generated Content or other material; and determine appropriate measures to prevent recurrence by the accused infringing party.

If the accused infringing party believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or s/he believes that s/he has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, s/he may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
