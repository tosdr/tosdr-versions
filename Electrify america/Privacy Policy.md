6. **How We Use Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Tools**
    
    Our Digital Properties (and authorized third parties) use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about you, your device, and how you interact with our Digital Properties. This section contains additional information about:
    
    * The types of tracking technologies we use and the purposes for which we use them
    * The types of information we collect using these technologies
    * How we disclose or make information available to others
    * Choices you may have regarding these technologies
    
    * **_Types of cookies and tracking technologies we use_**
        
        Our Digital Properties and the third parties that we authorize may use the following tracking technologies:
        
        * Cookies, which are a type of technology that install a small amount of information on a user's computer or other device when they visit a website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time.
        * Pixels, web beacons, and tags, which are types of code or transparent graphics that contain a unique identifier. In addition to the uses described in Section 5.2 below, these technologies provide analytical information about the user experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web pages.
        * Session replay tools, which record your interactions with our Digital Properties, such as how you move throughout our Digital Properties and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses described in Section 5.2 below, this information helps us improve our Digital Properties and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Digital Properties.
    * **_Purposes for using these technologies_**
        
        We and authorized third parties use these technologies to remember user preferences, login details and browsing behavior; improve the performance of our Digital Properties, products, and services; conduct analytics; provide you with offers that may be of interest to you; track your activity across online properties over time to better understand your preferences and interests; to conduct advertising on our Digital Properties and those of third parties; measure the effectiveness of our communications with you and advertising campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with one of our emails; and personalize online content. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us improve our Digital Properties, performance and user experiences. Google Analytics may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners).
        
    * **_Information collected_**
        
        These tracking technologies collect data about you and your device, such as your IP address, cookie ID, device ID, AdID, operating system, browser used, browser history, search history, and information about how you interact with our Digital Properties (such as pages on our Digital Properties that you have viewed).
        
    * **_Disclosures of your information_**
        
        We may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these technologies on our Digital Properties, such as social media companies, advertising networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting, security providers, and others that help us operate our business and Digital Properties.
        
    * **_Your choices_**
        
        Some of the third parties we work with participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [https://optout.networkadvertising.org/](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/). We adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may also click on the AboutAds icon on an Electrify America advertisement and follow the instructions on how to opt out.
        
        You can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our Digital Properties’ functionality may be impaired. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies. If you change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from Electrify America or its agents or representatives.
        
        Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. If you set your browser to signal that you do not wish to be tracked online, we will honor your preference by disabling social media and targeted advertising cookies.
        
7. **Security and Retention**
    
    We maintain reasonable security procedures and technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure, alteration, or use.
    
8. **Children’s Privacy**
    
    Interactions with us are intended for individuals 16 years of age and older. Our interactions are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 16 years of age.

If you believe that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 16, please contact us at the address below and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our databases.

        * **Right to Know.** You may have the right to request information about the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information, the purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing the Personal Information, and to whom we have disclosed your Personal Information and why. You may also have the right to request the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.
        * **Right to Delete.** You may have the right to request that we delete Personal Information that we have collected from you.
        * **Right to Correct.** You may have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.
        * **Right to Opt Out of Sales/Sharing/Targeted Advertising.** You may have the right to opt out of (i) the sale or sharing of your Personal Information and (ii) targeted advertising.
        
        You may exercise any of the rights available to you via our webform [https://privacy.electrifyamerica.com/welcome](https://privacy.electrifyamerica.com/welcome), or by calling us at 1-833-632-2778.
        
        In order to fully exercise the Right to Opt Out of Sales/Sharing/Targeted Advertising you must undertake both of the following steps:
        
        1. Submit an Opt Out of Sales/Sharing/Targeted Advertising request through on our webform [https://privacy.electrifyamerica.com/welcome](https://privacy.electrifyamerica.com/welcome).
        2. Disable the use of advertising cookies and other tracking technologies in the preference center, accessible via the “Do Not Sell” link at [https://www.electrifyamerica.com](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/). You must complete this step on each of our websites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signaling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use. Please note:
            * If you block cookies, we will be unable to comply with your request to opt out of sales/sharing/targeting with respect to device data that we automatically collect and disclose to third parties online using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies.
            * If you clear cookies, you will need to disable the use of all advertising cookies and tracking technologies in the preference center again on each browser on each device where you have cleared cookies.
        
        To the extent required by law, we will honor opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly used and recognized by businesses, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object. We will process opt-out preference signals at the browser level.
        
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.
        
        **_Verification:_** In order to process requests, we may need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity depending on the nature of the request. In most cases we will collect some or all of the following data elements: first and last name, email address. In some cases, we may request different or additional information, including a signed declaration that you are who you say you are, and will inform you if we need such information.
        
        **_Authorized Agents:_** Authorized agents may exercise rights on behalf of you by submitting a request via the webform at [https://privacy.electrifyamerica.com/welcome](https://privacy.electrifyamerica.com/welcome), and indicating that they are submitting the request as an agent. We may require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on behalf of you by providing signed permission from you. We may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or to directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
        
        **_Appeal:_** If we deny your rights request, you may have the right to appeal. To submit an appeal, contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will inform you in writing our response to your appeal.
        
    * **Additional Data Processing Disclosures**
        
        In addition to the disclosures above, this section provides supplemental information about how we process Personal Information. These additional disclosures apply only to individuals who reside in California as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").
        
    
    **Disclosure of Personal Data**
