Also, you may submit your email address for reasons such as registering for a contest or sweepstakes or signing up for email newsletters and special offers. If you submit your email address, We use it to deliver the information to you.

We always permit you to unsubscribe or opt-out of future emails. Because We have to communicate with you about orders that you choose to place, you cannot opt-out of receiving emails related to your orders.

For example, We may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use this Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.

While We will not sell (or trade or rent) personally identifiable information to other companies as part of Our regular course of business.

However, it’s possible that We might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that We might dispose of some or all of Our assets.

If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect.
