#### 10\. SUBSCRIPTION FEES

Our Content can initially be used free of charge. This includes early learning courses and content. If you decide to advance your learning, we have a range of subscription options to best meet your needs. You can opt to subscribe for our monthly (Monthly Plan), quarterly (Quarterly Plan) or annual (Annual Plan) subscription (each a "Plan" and together the “Plans”) to access advanced learning courses and content. Our fees for the Plans are available to view on our website at https://www.memrise.com/premium/ (“Fees”). Our Fees are subject to different subscription plans, gift plans and promotions, and we therefore reserve the right to update our Fees from time to time.

If you select the Monthly Plan your subscription will automatically renew as a rolling subscription and renew at the end of each monthly period, being one month (or as near to the date as possible) from the date on which your Monthly Plan was activated. If you select the Quarterly Plan your subscription will automatically renew as a rolling subscription and renew at the end of each three monthly period, being three months (or as near to the date as possible) from the date on which your Quarterly Plan was activated. If you select the Annual Plan, your subscription will automatically renew as a rolling subscription at the end of each annual period, on the date on which your Annual Plan was activated (each being a “Renewal”). If you proceed with a Renewal, the method of payment used to pay the Fees will be debited at the end of your current Plan. If you select Lifetime subscription, this will be charged as a one-off upfront payment without any renewals. Lifetime subscription constitutes 100 years or until the date Memrise ceases to commercially offer the Services.

You acknowledge that, if we change the Fees, this will not affect your existing subscription Plan, therefore, if you have signed up for Plan at a certain Fee, any Fee changes will not affect any current subscription or any Renewals.

You may change your Plan at any time by locating the ‘Account‘ tab on the settings page of your Profile. The effect of the changes are as follows:

* From Monthly Plan to Quarterly Plan or Annual Plan – your Quarterly Plan or Annual Plan will be activated immediately after payment is processed and any time left on your Monthly Plan will be cancelled and will not be refunded;
* From Quarterly Plan to Annual Plan – your Annual Plan will be activated immediately after payment is processed and any time left on your Quarterly Plan will be cancelled and will not be refunded;
* From Annual to Monthly – your Annual plan will continue to be active until the expiry of the remainder of your current Annual subscription and your Monthly plan will be activated once your Annual plan subscription has expired; and
* From Annual Plan to Quarterly Plan – your Annual Plan will continue to be active until the expiry of the remainder of your current Annual Plan and your Quarterly Plan will be activated once your Annual Plan has expired.

Your subscription may start with a free trial. The free trial period for any subscription will last for the period of time specified when you signed up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers, as specified. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, the first billing day will be the day after the free trial expires. E.g for 7 day free trial the billing day will be the 8th day. However, no charges will be made if you cancel the subscription prior to the end of your free trial period. You may cancel your membership at any time by going to your account settings.

Please note that the following conditions apply for Renewals of the Plans:

* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period
* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period
* If you have purchased a plan at a discounted rate then you may be charged the full price for the renewal  

#### 11\. CANCELLATION AND REFUND OF SUBSCRIPTION

You can keep track of your subscription by locating your settings page on your Profile, selecting the ‘Account’ tab which will display the expiry date of your subscription. You may cancel your subscription at any time by locating your settings page on your Profile, selecting the ‘Account’ tab and selecting "Cancel Plan”.

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, where we provide you with a full refund if you are not satisfied with our Services and where you have selected the Quarterly Plan or the Annual Plan. To be eligible to receive this refund, you must contact us within thirty (30) days from the date you activated your Quarterly Plan or Annual Plan. If you do not contact us within this thirty (30) day period, you will not be eligible for a refund. We will not be able to refund you, if you have paid the Fees using any third-party scripts or products that anonymise personal payment details, including but not limited to, Apple App Store payments. In this instance, you will need to contact the relevant third-party directly. If you have selected Monthly Plan, you are not eligible for a refund under our 30-day money-back guarantee.

You also have a legal right under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 to change your mind, without giving us a reason, and cancel your subscription (this includes Monthly Plan, Quarterly Plan and Annual Plan) within fourteen (14) days of the date you activated your plan in order to receive a refund. If you want to cancel your subscription within this fourteen (14) day period, you can do so via our Contact Us page.

Please note that the refund options stated above do not apply to Renewals. Also, we do not offer refunds or partial refunds outside of the refund options stated above. Any refund requested will result in payment being made into the account you used to pay the Fees within fourteen (14) days.

#### 12\. DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT

You can delete your account and terminate your use of the Services at any time by locating the ‘delete profile’ option in the settings section of your Profile. Once you have deleted your Account, your Licence will be revoked and you will no longer have access to your Profile and we will delete all of the information contained in your Profile. Please be aware that due to technical reasons beyond our control, it might take some time until your personal information disappears completely from search engines (such as Google). We accept no liability for deletion of information or content from your Profile. You acknowledge and accept that certain User Content may remain after the cancellation of your Profile and that the User Content Licence shall not be revoked or terminated. If you have an active subscription when you delete your Account, you will not receive a refund for any time remaining on your subscription.

#### 13\. TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT BY US

We reserve the right to modify, temporarily suspend or permanently delete your Account and terminate your access to the Services if we have reason to believe that you have breached or acted inconsistently with the Terms. Following termination, your Licence will be automatically revoked and we reserve the right to delete your Account, erase all or any information on your Profile and discard any of your User Content. You agree that we shall not be liable to you for any modification or discontinuance of the Service.

You understand and agree that the Services are provided “as is” and that you use the Services at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of fitness of the Services for a particular purpose. We do not make any representation or warranty of any kind and do not assume any responsibility for any improvement of your language learning or your learning of any other subject by use of our Services, accuracy of Our Content, User Content or any other content available by use of the Services. Access to the Services may be slow, limited or unavailable during periods of peak demand, system upgrades, malfunctions or scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or for any other reason beyond our reasonable control.

#### 15\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

You acknowledge and warrant that we, our officers, employees, contractors, suppliers, affiliates, agents and licensors are not and shall not be liable to you for any damages, including but not limited to loss of profit, inaccurate results, loss or corruption of Your Content or any data, data being inaccurate, the cost of recovering any data or Your Content, inability to access the Services, the cost of substitute services, claims by third parties for any damage to computers, software, modems, telephones or any other property, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, even where we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. We only provide our site for consumer private use. You agree not to use our site for any commercial or business purposes, and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

The maximum aggregate liability of us to you in relation to any paid Services (whether such liability arises in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, not exceed the total amount of the Fees paid by you to us for the Services in the 12 months prior to the initial action giving rise to the liability, which is an aggregate limit that will not increase according to the number of claims brought by you. If no Fees have been paid by you and your use of the Services has been limited to the free Services, you shall not be entitled to any damages of any kind.

If you have a dispute with another User relating to, arising from, or in any way connected with use of the Services, you release us from all claims, demands and damages of any kind or nature arising out of or in any way connected with such dispute.
