The Website uses cookies and other technologies to make it easier for you to use our services during future visits, monitor traffic on our Website and to personalize instructional content, pursuant to our Privacy Policy.  
  
Some cookies expire after a certain amount of time, or upon logging out (session cookies), others remain on your computer or device for a longer period (persistent cookies). The Website uses first-party cookies (cookies set directly by Memrise) as well as third-party cookies, as described below.

### II. Local Storage

Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or mobile app to store and retrieve data on an individual’s computer, mobile phone, or other device. This is used to store user preferences such as course on the dashboard and muting audio, and to track the chosen method of user login and sign-up (but immediately cleared after sign-up).

**Your Choices**. Please note that if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website and you may not be able to benefit from the full functionality of the Website.

  
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive a notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
