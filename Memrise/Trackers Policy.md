### II. Local Storage

Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or mobile app to store and retrieve data on an individual’s computer, mobile phone, or other device. This is used to store user preferences such as course on the dashboard and muting audio, and to track the chosen method of user login and sign-up (but immediately cleared after sign-up).

**Your Choices**. Please note that if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website and you may not be able to benefit from the full functionality of the Website.

  
On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive a notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
