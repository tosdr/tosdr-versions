use of our website
------------------

![](https://www.consentmanager.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/13-1024x873-1-300x256.png)

In principle, you can use our website for purely informational purposes without disclosing your identity. When accessing the individual pages of the website in this way, only access data is transmitted to our web space provider so that the website can be displayed to you. The following data is processed here:

* browser type/ browser version,
* operating system used,
* language and version of the browser software,
* date and time of access,
* host name of the accessing end device,
* IP address,
* Content of the request (specific website),
* access status/HTTP status code,
* websites accessed through the website,
* Referrer URL (the previously visited website),
* Notification of whether the call was successful
* amount of data transferred,
* Time zone difference to GMT.

The temporary processing of this data is necessary in order to technically enable the website visit and delivery of the website to your end device. The access data is not used to identify individual users and is not merged with other data sources. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interests lie in ensuring the functionality of the website and the integrity and security of the website. The access data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose of their processing. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is usually the case when you end your visit to the website.

**You can object to the processing. You have the right to object for reasons that arise from your particular situation. You can send us your objection using the contact details given in the “Responsible” section.**

tracking
--------

In addition to the aforementioned access data, so-called cookies, pixels, browser fingerprinting or other tracking technologies are used when using the website. Cookies are small data packages with a sequence of numbers that are stored locally in the cache or hard drive of the browser used. Pixels are one-pixel images that are created opaque or in the background color of the website and are therefore not visible to the user. The pixel also collects information about your user behavior on the website. Fingerprinting technologies generate a unique fingerprint based on the browser settings and thus identify an individual browser. Using a script that every Internet browser runs automatically, information such as the resolution of the screen, fonts used, operating system, hardware information and integrated browser plugins can sometimes be collected, which in their specific combination can ultimately make it possible to trace back to a specific user . The tracking technologies serve to make our website user-friendly. The use of tracking technologies may be technically necessary or for other purposes (e.g. analysis/evaluation of website usage).

### Technically necessary elements

Some elements of our website require that the calling browser can be identified even after a page change. In the technically necessary elements, such as in particular cookies or similar methods of terminal device access, the following data is processed for the purpose of carrying out or facilitating electronic communication and providing an information society service requested by the user:

* Language settings,
* font settings,
* Log-in information (e.g. for our customer portals)
* Analysis of website usage (e.g. for the purpose of providing the necessary hardware resources)

![](https://www.consentmanager.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/19-300x154.png)

The user data collected through technically necessary elements are not processed to create user profiles. We also use so-called “session cookies”, which store a session ID with which various requests from your browser can be assigned to the joint session. “Session cookies” are necessary for using the website. In particular, we can use it to recognize the end device used when you return to the website. We use this cookie to recognize you on subsequent visits to the website if you have an account with us; otherwise you will have to log in again each time you visit. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest in processing consists in providing the special functionalities mentioned and thereby making the use of the website more attractive and effective. The “session cookies” are deleted as soon as you log out or, depending on which browser you are using and which browser settings you have made, when you close the browser.

**You can object to the processing. You have the right to object for reasons that arise from your particular situation. You can send us your objection using the contact details given in the “Responsible” section.**

### Technically unnecessary tracking

We also use cookies, pixels, browser fingerprinting and other tracking technologies on the website to enable an analysis of the surfing behavior of users. For example, the following data is stored and processed:

* Frequency of page views
* Use of website functions (e.g. registration)

The legal basis for this processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) GDPR. The technically unnecessary cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may differ depending on the tracking method. Insofar as we integrate third-party cookies or pixels and similar tracking technologies into our website, we will point this out to you separately below.

**You can revoke your consent to the processing of the respective provider at any time by calling up the consent tool via the icon at the bottom left of the website and unchecking the checkbox under “Advanced settings”. The lawfulness of the processing remains unaffected until the revocation is exercised.**

### Consent management platform consentmanager

We use our consent tool “consentmanager” to request consent for the processing of your end device information and personal data using cookies or other tracking technologies on our website. With the help of “consentmanager” you have the option of agreeing to or rejecting the processing of your end device information and personal data using cookies or other tracking technologies for the purposes listed in “consentmanager”. Such processing purposes can include the integration of external elements, integration of streaming content, statistical analysis, range measurement, individualized product recommendations and individualized advertising. You can use “consentmanager” to give or deny your consent for all processing purposes or to give or deny your consent for individual purposes or individual third parties. You can also change the settings you have made afterwards. The purpose of integrating “consentmanager” is to allow the users of our website to decide whether to set cookies and similar functionalities and to offer them the opportunity to change settings that have already been made as part of their continued use of our website. In the course of using “consentmanager”, we process personal data and information about the end devices used. Your data will also be sent to consentmanager (consentmanager AB, Håltegelvägen 1b, 72348 Västerås, Sweden). The information about the settings you have made will also be stored on your end device. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 7 para. 1 GDPR, insofar as the processing serves to fulfill the statutory obligations to provide evidence for the granting of consent. Incidentally, Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR the relevant legal basis. Our legitimate interests in processing lie in the storage of user settings and preferences in relation to the use of cookies and the evaluation of consent rates. Twelve months after making the user settings, you will be asked for consent again. The user settings made are then saved again for this period of time, unless you first delete the information about your user settings in the end device capacities provided for this purpose.

**You can object to the processing if the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR. You have the right to object for reasons that arise from your particular situation. You can send us your objection using the contact details given in the “Responsible” section.**

Contacting our company
----------------------

When contacting our company, e.g. B. by e-mail or via the contact form on the website, the personal data you provide (such as first and last name, telephone number or Skype name) will be processed by us in order to answer your request. In order to process inquiries via the contact form on the website, it is mandatory to provide a name and a valid e-mail address. At the time the message is sent to us, your IP address and the date and time of registration will also be processed. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) GDPR or Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) GDPR if contact is aimed at concluding a contract. If the request is aimed at concluding a contract, the details of your data are required and obligatory for the conclusion of a contract. If the data is not provided, it is not possible to conclude or implement a contract in the form of contacting us or processing the request. The processing of the personal data from the input mask serves solely to process the contact. If contact is made by email, this is also the necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data. The other data processed during the sending process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. In this context, the data is not passed on to third parties. We delete the data arising in this context after the processing is no longer necessary – usually two years after the end of the communication – or limit the processing if necessary to compliance with the existing statutory storage obligations.

**You can object to the processing. You have the right to object for reasons that arise from your particular situation. You can send us your objection using the contact details given in the “Responsible” section.**

Processing for contractual purposes
-----------------------------------

![](https://www.consentmanager.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-300x209.png)

We process your personal data if and to the extent that this is necessary for the initiation, justification, implementation and/or termination of a legal transaction with our company. The legal basis for this results from Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) GDPR. The provision of your data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract and you are contractually obliged to make your data available. If your data is not provided, it is not possible to conclude and/or execute a contract. After the purpose has been achieved (e.g. contract processing), the personal data will be blocked or deleted for further processing, unless we have given your consent (e.g. consent to the processing of the e-mail address for sending electronic advertising mail), a contractual Agreement, a legal authorization (e.g. authorization to send direct mail) or based on legitimate interests (e.g. storage to enforce claims) are authorized to further processing.

Your personal data will be passed on to third parties if

* it is necessary for the establishment, implementation or termination of legal transactions with our company (e.g. when passing on data to a payment service provider/a shipping company to process a contract with you), (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b ) GDPR), or
* a subcontractor or vicarious agent, whom we use exclusively within the scope of providing the offers or services you require, requires this data (unless you have been expressly informed otherwise, such auxiliary persons are only entitled to process the data to the extent that this is necessary for the performance of the offer or service is necessary), or
* an enforceable official order (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. c) GDPR) exists, or
* there is an enforceable court order (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. c) GDPR), or
* we are obliged to do so by law (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. c) GDPR), or
* the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. d) GDPR), or
* it is necessary for the performance of a task that is in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority (Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. e) GDPR), or
* we can invoke our overriding legitimate interests or a third party for disclosure (Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

Your personal data will not be passed on to other people, companies or bodies unless you have given your effective consent to such a transfer. The legal basis for processing is then Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Within the scope of this data protection information, we refer you to the respective recipients in relation to the respective processing operation.

customer account
----------------

In order to be able to use the services of consentmanager, you must create a customer account with the following information:

* First and Last Name,
* User name,
* Address,
* email address and
* self-selected password.

Furthermore, your IP address and the date and time of registration are processed at the time of registration. We use the double opt-in procedure for registration. After you have submitted the data required for registration, you will receive an email with an activation link. Only after the link has been activated by clicking will access to your customer account be created and registration successfully completed. In the case of later registrations (logins), the access data (user ID and password) you selected when you first registered must be entered. If the transmitted link is not confirmed within 24 hours, we will automatically delete it after one month at the latest.
