We have carefully selected these third parties and taken steps to ensure that when we share your Personal Information with them, it is adequately protected. Details about how we process Personal Information in conjunction with third parties is set out below:

* **Mailchimp** – We use Mailchimp to run and operate, but not limited to, our Newsletter. When visitors to our website sign up by adding their contact details they are then stored and used for marketing, promoting and furthering IEA reach via the Newsletter.

For more information on how Mailchimp processes Personal Information, please view the [Mailchimp Privacy Policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

For more information on how Salesforce processes Personal Information, please view [Salesforce’s Privacy Information](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/).

* **Eventbrite** – Used to invite, manage, and verify guests for a range of our events. It allows staff to easily access who have signed up to an event, and then sign them in on the day; giving greater administrative and secure powers than manually creating lists. This information may be saved and stored via Office 365 or Salesforce in order to track and verify who have previously attended our events.

For more information on how Eventbrite processes Personal Information, please view [Eventbrite’s Privacy Policy](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/help/en-gb/articles/460838/eventbrite-privacy-policy/).

This gives our media team effective oversight on what are our most effective modes of education and give valuable information that influences how we shape and deliver our future content.

For more information on how Google Analytics processes Personal Information, please view [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/).

* **Zoom** – We often use the Zoom platform for public and private events. If you register for any IEA event on this platform, personal information you provide may be stored in either Zoom, or the host’s, cloud services. Zoom cloud has ‘robust and validated access controls’ to protect user and guest data.

For more information on how Zoom processes your personal data, please view their [Privacy Policy](https://zoom.us/privacy).

For more information on ‘host’s cloud storage’, please read below in the ‘Office 365’ section of this policy.

This will primarily include Outlook, OneDrive, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, SharePoint, Teams, and all other platforms Office 365 Business Premium has to offer. This data is then protected by Microsoft, with extensive security measures in place – by both the consumer and supplier.

For more information on how Office 365 processes Personal Information, please view [Microsoft’s Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement).

* **IEA Forum** – Your details may be shared with IEA Forum Limited – a separate not-for-profit entity that supports the IEA’s mission to improve understanding of the fundamental institutions of a free society by analysing and expounding the role of markets in solving economic and social problems. IEA Forum supports and participates in activities that are either clearly non-charitable, or significantly at risk of being considered as such given the changing climate for the regulation of think tanks. Your data may be used to support fundraising, project work, research work, communications, educational programmes and personal interests that you have expressed relating to topics we cover at the IEA. We guarantee your details will not be used for any other operations or purposes that are not outlined in the details of this policy, as outlined in section 4.1 (above)

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

##### **6\. Data Security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees and third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

##### **7\. Data Retention**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil our legal obligations or for the purposes we collected it for.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request by contacting us at [datacontroller@iea.org.uk](mailto:datacontroller@iea.org.uk).

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request Erasure below for further information.
