Zendesk
-------

We use the CRM system Zendesk to process user inquiries. The provider is Zendesk, Inc, 1019 Market Street in San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.

We use Zendesk to process your inquiries quickly and efficiently. This constitutes a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. You can only send inquiries by entering your email address and without providing your name. The messages sent to us will remain with us until you ask us to delete them or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.

Zendesk has Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) that have been approved by the Irish Data Protection Authority. These are binding corporate rules that legitimize the internal transfer of data to third countries outside the EU and the EEA. Details can be found here: [https://www.zendesk.de/blog/update-privacy-shield-invalidation-european-court-justice/](https://www.zendesk.de/blog/update-privacy-shield-invalidation-european-court-justice/).

If you do not agree to your request being processed by us via Zendesk, you can alternatively communicate with us by email, telephone or fax.

Further information can be found in Zendesk’s privacy policy: [https://www.zendesk.de/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/](https://www.zendesk.de/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/).

Our website offers you the option of sending us messages via a chat window. The chat functions are provided by Zendesk. If you use this chat window, we store your IP address in addition to your chat messages. It is not necessary to provide your name for the chat.

We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) with the above-mentioned provider. This is a contract required by data protection law, which ensures that the provider only processes the personal data of our website visitors in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.

These are only integrated into the page as HTML links, so that when you call up our website, no connection is yet established with the servers of the respective provider. If you click on one of the buttons, the website of the respective social network opens in a new window of your browser There you can, for example, press the Like or Share button.

USE OF PERSONAL DATA IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS
-----------------------------------------------

**Purpose of data collection**

We generally use your personal data to respond to your inquiry, process your order, or provide you with access to specific information or offers. Further information on data protection can also be found on this website. However, we would also like to facilitate your job search. You can therefore apply for jobs with us directly online or by e-mail. We assure you that your data will be treated confidentially. The data you provide will be processed and used exclusively for the purpose of selecting applicants.

**What data is collected?**

We only collect the information required for an application process with us.  
When you apply for a position with us, you will be asked for certain personal data (name, address, e-mail). In addition, position-related questions may be asked. For an application at our company, it is also mandatory to include your professional background.  
Please note that your data will not be stored anonymously, but will be accessible to the HR department and to the departments at our company that are relevant to the position.

**Application information**

By submitting your application, you represent that the information you have provided is true and accurate. Please note that any false statement or omission may be grounds for rejection or subsequent dismissal.  
We seek applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, belief, disability, age or sexual identity. We do not require any information from you that is not usable under the General Equal Treatment Act. Please also do not forward to us any confidential internal information or even trade secrets of your former or current employer. In addition, please do not provide any unnecessary information regarding: Illnesses, pregnancy, ethnic origin, political views, philosophical or religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sex life, defamatory or honorable information, as well as information that has nothing to do with the job profile.

**Who processes the data?**

The data we collect is processed exclusively internally or by contractually affiliated service providers. Personal data is only passed on for specific purposes within the framework of order processing in accordance with data protection regulations to bodies that, for example, operate our servers or provide certain services. These bodies are located in Germany and in the countries of the EU and are bound by contractual obligations and data protection instructions to handle personal data in accordance with data protection law.  
The data and files you provide will be processed and used exclusively for the purpose of processing your application. The data and files you provide may, if your application is successful, be further processed and used by us in an employment relationship for employment purposes. If the application for a job offer is unsuccessful, we will store the submitted data and files in an applicant database for six months in order to be able to answer subsequent questions about the application. After six months, the data and files are deleted. It is possible to withdraw the application at any time. If you withdraw your application, your data and files will be deleted from the applicant database immediately, subject to the restrictions listed below. Furthermore, as part of the application process, you can request at any time that individual data or files you have submitted to us be deleted. However, we reserve the right to store a limited amount of your data for a limited period of three months in order to comply with legal requirements, in particular obligations to provide evidence under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).

**With whom do we share your personal data?**

The information you provide to us will be treated confidentially and will only be passed on to those persons who are involved in a specific application process. Your personal data will only be passed on to other Group companies with your separate, explicit consent.  
Please refer to the relevant notice on this website.

**Right of access, editing and deletion of your resume**

You can access, edit or delete your resume at any time. You may also ask us to assist you in doing so.  
Please understand that, for legal reasons, it is not possible to change or delete data during an ongoing application process or for a period of approximately three months after the end of an ongoing application process.

Security
--------

We have implemented technical and administrative security measures to protect your personal data against loss, destruction, manipulation and unauthorized access. All our employees and service providers working for us are bound by the applicable data protection laws.

Whenever we collect and process personal data, it is encrypted before it is transmitted. This means that your data cannot be misused by third parties. Our security measures are subject to a continuous improvement process and our data protection statements are constantly being revised. Please make sure that you have the latest version.

Rights of the data subject
--------------------------

You have a right to information, correction, deletion or restriction of the processing of your stored data at any time, a right to object to the processing as well as a right to data portability and to lodge a complaint in accordance with the requirements of data protection law.

### Right of access by the data subjec:

You can request information from us as to whether and to what extent we process your data.

### Right to rectification:

If we process your data that is incomplete or incorrect, you can request that we correct or complete it at any time.

### Right to erasure (right to be forgotten):

You can demand that we delete your data if we process it unlawfully or if the processing disproportionately interferes with your legitimate interests in protection. Please note that there may be reasons that prevent immediate deletion, e.g. in the case of legally regulated retention obligations.

Irrespective of the exercise of your right to deletion, we will delete your data immediately and completely, provided that there is no legal or statutory obligation to retain data in this respect.

### Right to restriction of the processing:

You may request us to restrict the processing of your data if.

* you dispute the accuracy of the data, for a period of time that allows us to verify the accuracy of the data.
* the processing of the data is unlawful, but you refuse erasure and request restriction of data use instead,
* we no longer need the data for the intended purpose, but you still need this data to assert or defend legal claims, or
* you have objected to the processing of the data.

### Right to data portability:

You may request that we provide you with your data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and that you may transfer this data to another controller without hindrance from us, provided that

* we process this data on the basis of a revocable consent given by you or for the performance of a contract between us, and
* this processing is carried out with the aid of automated procedures.

If technically feasible, you may request us to transfer your data directly to another controller.

### Right to object:

If we process your data for legitimate interest, you may object to this data processing at any time; this would also apply to profiling based on these provisions. We will then no longer process your data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims. You may object to the processing of your data for the purpose of direct marketing at any time without giving reasons.

### Right of complaint:

If you are of the opinion that we violate German or European data protection law when processing your data, please contact us to clarify any questions. Of course, you also have the right to contact the supervisory authority responsible for you, the respective state office for data protection supervision.  
If you wish to assert any of the aforementioned rights against us, please contact our data protection officer. In case of doubt, we may request additional information to confirm your identity.
