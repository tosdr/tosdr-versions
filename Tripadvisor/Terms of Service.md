Welcome to the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties located at www.Tripadvisor.com and applicable country top level domains (including sub-domains associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as “apps”), data, SMS, APIs, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the “**Services**”; more generally, the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties shall hereinafter be referred to herein as “websites”).

The Services are provided by Tripadvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in the United States of America (“**Tripadvisor**”) with its registered office at \[Tripadvisor LLC, 400 1st Avenue, Needham, MA 02494, USA\]. The terms “we”, “us”, “our” shall be construed accordingly.

By creating a Tripadvisor account, you agree to be bound by the terms, conditions and notices set forth below (collectively, this “Agreement”). This Agreement does not apply to if you merely browse the websites or use the Services without creating a Tripadvisor account.  Please read this Agreement carefully, as it contains information concerning your legal rights and limitations on these rights, as well as a section regarding applicable law and jurisdiction of disputes.  If you are a consumer in the EU or UK you have a legal right to withdraw from this Agreement within 14 days of the Agreement being made. You can do this, or terminate this Agreement at any other time, by closing your account (by contacting us or by accessing “Account Info” whilst logged in and selecting the “close account” option) and no longer accessing or using the Services. ).

If you are a consumer in the EU or UK you will have certain mandatory consumer rights. If you are a consumer living elsewhere, you may also have consumer rights under the laws of your territory. Nothing in this Agreement affects your mandatory consumer rights.

Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise interact with through the Services shall be referred to as “Content”. “Services” as defined above refers to those provided by Tripadvisor or our corporate affiliates (Tripadvisor and such entities, when one or more are referred to, shall be collectively defined as the “Tripadvisor Companies”). For the avoidance of doubt, the websites are all owned and controlled by Tripadvisor.  However, some specific Services made available via the websites may be owned and controlled by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates, for example Services facilitating the booking of Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with third-party suppliers (see below). As part of our Services, we may send you notifications about special offers, products, or additional services available from us, our affiliates, or our partners, that may be of interest to you. Such notifications will typically be sent through newsletters and marketing communications and represent efforts to get to know you and your preferences better across our Services and those of our affiliates. In turn, this enables customisation of the services in line with those preferences.

The term “you” or "user" refers to the individual, company, business organisation or other legal entity which has created a Tripadvisor account and uses the Services and/or contributes Content to them. The Content that you contribute, submit, transmit and/or post to or through the Services shall be referred to variously as “your Content”, “Content of yours” and/or “Content you submit.”

The Services are provided on an ongoing basis, and are provided solely to:

1. Assist users in gathering travel information, posting Content and searching for and booking travel services and reservations; and
2. Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with users and potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the Tripadvisor Companies.

#### Products, services, information and Content on our Services change regularly, so that it is up to date (for example, with current information and offers). This means, for example, that in respect of third party services, new transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences may become available for you to book whilst other services may become unavailable.

We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement. We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting. We will notify you of material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with your profile or by placing a notice on our websites. Be sure to return to this page periodically to review the most current version of this Agreement. If you don't want to accept any changes to this Agreement, you may close your account and cease to access the Services (a description of how to do so is available [**here**](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-US/hc/traveler/articles/510)).

**USE OF THE SERVICES**

As a condition of your use of the Services, you agree that (i) all information supplied by you via the Services to the Tripadvisor Companies is true, accurate, current and complete, (ii) you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you, (iii) you are 13 years of age or older. The Tripadvisor Companies do not knowingly collect the information of anyone under the age of 13. If you are a consumer resident in the EU or the UK, we may deny you access to the Services if you violate this Agreement, or for any other reasonable cause. If you are not a consumer resident in the EU or the UK, we retain the right at our sole discretion to deny you access to the Services, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of this Agreement. By using the Services, including any products or services that facilitate the sharing of Content to or from third party sites, you understand that you are solely responsible for any information that you share with the Tripadvisor Companies. You may access the Services solely as intended through the provided functionality of the Services and as permitted under this Agreement.

Copying, transmission, reproduction, replication, posting or redistribution of (a) Content or any portion thereof and/or (b) the Services more generally is strictly prohibited without the prior written permission of the Tripadvisor Companies. To request permission, please direct your request to:

Director, Partnerships and Business Development

Tripadvisor LLC

400 1st Avenue

Needham, MA 02494, USA

In order to access certain features of the Services, you will need to create an account. When you create an account, you must provide complete and accurate information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, including your interaction and communication with others, and you must safeguard your account. Towards this end,  you agree to keep your contact information up to date. 

If you are creating a Tripadvisor account for commercial purposes and are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a company, organisation or other legal entity, you agree that you are authorised to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the words “you” and “your” as used in this Agreement shall refer to such entity and the individual acting on behalf of the company shall be referred to as a “Business Representative”.

Through your use of the Services you may encounter links to third party sites and apps or be able to interact with third party sites and apps. This may include the ability to share Content from the Services, including your Content, with such third party sites and apps. Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the Tripadvisor Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information purposes only. Any interactions with third party sites and apps are at your own risk. You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are in no way responsible or liable for any such third party sites or apps.

Tripadvisor Companies rank and present listings to you using recommender systems. Different categories of listings (such as hotels and restaurants, things to do and flights) are ranked based on different criteria, such as price, "traveller favourites" and duration. Full details of our policy and criteria for ranking can be found on the [How the Site Works webpage](https://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/service_en.html).

Some Content you see or otherwise access on or through the Services is used for commercial purposes. You agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.

**ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS**

The Tripadvisor Companies may, from time to time, decide to change, update or discontinue certain products and features of the Services. You agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies have no obligation to store or maintain your Content or other information you provide, except to the extent required by applicable law.

We also offer other services that may be governed by additional terms or agreements. If you use any other such services, the additional terms will be made available and will become part of this Agreement, except where such additional terms expressly exclude or otherwise supersede this Agreement. For example, if you use or purchase such additional services for commercial or business purposes, you must agree to the applicable additional terms. To the extent any other terms conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the additional terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict with respect to those specific services.

**PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES**

The Content and information available on and through the Services (including, but not limited to, messages, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, video, maps, icons, software, code or other material), as well as the infrastructure used to provide such Content and information, is proprietary to the Tripadvisor Companies or licensed to the Tripadvisor Companies by third parties. For all Content other than your Content, you agree not to otherwise modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer or sell or re-sell any information, software, products or services obtained from or through the Services. Additionally, you agree not to:

* (iii) violate the restrictions in any robot exclusion headers on the Services or bypass or circumvent other measures employed to prevent or limit access to the Services;
* (iv) take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion (or, if you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, in our reasonable discretion), an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;
* (v) deep-link to any portion of the Services for any purpose without our express written permission;
* (vi) "frame", "mirror" or otherwise incorporate any part of the Services into any other websites or service without our prior written authorisation;

* (ix) download any Content unless it’s expressly made available for download by the Tripadvisor Companies; or
* (x) use, or assist, encourage, or enable any third-party to use, any robot, spider, artificial intelligence (AI) system, or other automated device, process or means to access, retrieve, copy, scrape, aggregate, collect, download, or otherwise index any portion of the Services or any Content, except as expressly permitted by Tripadvisor in writing.

**PRIVACY POLICY AND DISCLOSURES**

Any personal information you post on or otherwise submit in connection with the Services will be used in accordance with our Privacy and Cookies Statement. Click [here](https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/US) to view our Privacy and Cookies Statement.

**REVIEWS, COMMENTS AND USE OF OTHER INTERACTIVE AREAS; LICENCE GRANT**

We appreciate hearing from you. Please be aware that by providing your Content to or through the Services, be it via email, posting via any Tripadvisor synchronisation product, via the services and applications of others, or otherwise, including any of your Content that is transmitted to your Tripadvisor account by virtue of any Tripadvisor Companies product or service, reviews, questions, photographs or videos, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like contained in any of your Content, you grant the Tripadvisor Companies a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right to (a) host, use, reproduce, modify, run, adapt, translate, distribute, publish, create derivative works from and publicly display and perform such Content of yours throughout the world in any media, now known or hereafter devised; (b) make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same; (c) to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make your Content shared on the Services available to other companies, organisations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content of yours on other media and services, subject to our Privacy Policy and this Agreement; and (d) use the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with such Content of yours. You acknowledge that Tripadvisor may choose to provide attribution of your Content at our sole discretion (or, if you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, in our reasonable discretion). You further grant the Tripadvisor Companies the right to pursue at law any person or entity that violates your or the Tripadvisor Companies’ rights in your Content by a breach of this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that your Content is non-confidential and non-proprietary. You agree that you own or have the necessary licences, rights (including copyright and other proprietary rights), consents and permissions to publish and otherwise use (and for the Tripadvisor Companies to publish and otherwise use) your Content as authorised under this Agreement.

If it is determined that you retain moral rights (including rights of attribution or integrity) in your Content, you hereby declare that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) you do not require that any personally identifying information be used in connection with the Content, or any derivative works of or upgrades or updates thereto; (b) you have no objection to the publication, use, modification, deletion and exploitation of your Content by the Tripadvisor Companies or their licensees, successors and assigns; (c) you forever waive and agree not to claim or assert any entitlement to any and all moral rights of an author in any of your Content; and (d) you forever release the Tripadvisor Companies and their licensees, successors and assigns, from any claims that you could otherwise assert against the Tripadvisor Companies by virtue of any such moral rights.

Note that any feedback and other suggestions you provide may be used at any time and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.

The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items ("Interactive Areas"). If Tripadvisor provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.  To the extent that any entity that is one of the Tripadvisor Companies provides any form of private communication channel between users, you agree that such entity(ies) may monitor the substance of such communications in order to help safeguard our community and the Services. You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging.  In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users’ Content that appears on the websites.  The Tripadvisor Companies nevertheless reserve the right to remove and/or restrict without notice any such messaging or other Content from the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this Agreement or otherwise believe the removal and/or restriction is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or other users of the Services. Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you can appeal our decision through Tripadvisor's internal complaint handling process. You can find further information on how to object to and appeal a decision to remove or restrict your Content [here](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-US/hc/traveler/articles/623)  By using any Interactive Areas, you expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with Tripadvisor’s published guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by Tripadvisor.  You expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any Content of yours that:

1. Is false, unlawful, misleading, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing (or advocates harassment of another person), threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;

6. Constitutes mass mailings or “spamming”, “junk mail”, “chain letters” or “pyramid schemes”;
7. Impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity, including the Tripadvisor Companies;
8. Is private information of any third party, including, without limitation, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, National Insurance numbers and credit card numbers.  Note that an individual’s surname (family name) may be posted to our websites, but only where express permission of the identified individual has been secured beforehand;
9. Contains restricted or password-only access pages, or hidden pages or images (those not linked to or from another accessible page);
10. Include or are intended to facilitate viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;
11. Is unrelated to the topic of the Interactive Area(s) in which such Content is posted; or
12. In the sole judgment of Tripadvisor (or, if you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, in our reasonable judgment), (a) violates the previous subsections herein, (b) violates Tripadvisor’s related guidelines as made available to you by Tripadvisor, (c) is objectionable, (d) restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Interactive Areas or any other aspect of the Services, or (e) may expose any of the Tripadvisor Companies or their users to any harm or liability of any type.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Tripadvisor Companies take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Content posted, stored, transmitted or uploaded to the Services by you (in the case of your Content) or any third party (in the case of any and all Content more generally), or for any loss or damage thereto, nor are the Tripadvisor Companies liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter. As a provider of interactive services, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion (or, if you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, in our reasonable discretion), to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense. Full details of our content moderation policies, including the restrictions that we might impose on your content can be found [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Trust).

**RESTRICTION AND/OR SUSPENSION OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES**

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally. Tripadvisor may also suspend the processing of notices and complaints submitted through the Services if you frequently submit manifestly unfounded notices or complaints.

Our approach to the suspension of your use of the platform is further detailed [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Trust)

#### Restricting Tripadvisor’s Licence Rights. You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited licence as described further below (such limited licence to be referred to herein as a “Restricted Licence”).  You may make this election by selecting such Restricted Licence grant [here](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Settings-cs) (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the licence terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard Licence”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard Licence to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard Licence), but shall be granted a “Restricted Licence” as to the balance of your Content as defined below:

1. When you post your Content to the Services, the licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted Licence applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g. a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.

1. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services.  Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ licence rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted Licence by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available [**here**](https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/en-US/hc/traveler/articles/510)).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.

1. The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.  In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.  

1. The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made "public" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services.

1. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement. The licence you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted Licence”.

1. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programmes is not subject to the Restricted Licence, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or programme.

**BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor**

#### Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.

#### IMPORTANT: Tripadvisor does not itself sell travel reservations. Tripadvisor allows third parties to sell their travel reservations on Tripadvisor.

#### Tripadvisor may facilitate the promotion and sale of travel reservations by third parties to you. Tripadvisor is not, however, the party that undertakes the promotion and/or sale. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, the contract for the reservation is always solely between you and the third-party. Tripadvisor is not (a) the buyer or the seller of reservation; (b) a party to the contract with the third-party or responsible for the fulfilment of that contract; or (c) an agent of you or the third-party in connection with purchase or sale. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers.

Your rights of recourse in connection with a contract between you and a third-party supplier (for example, in relation to refunds and cancellations), will be between you and the third party as set out in the contract with that third-party. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy as between us and you will be for you to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation and obtain a refund (if applicable and subject to applicable law and your contract with the third-party supplier).

#### Third party suppliers may be businesses or consumers. If you are a consumer resident in the UK or EU, and the third party supplier you contract with is also consumer please note that you will not be able to enforce any consumer rights against that supplier.

#### By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will need to create an account if you have not already, and you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement.

AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (1) THE TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORISED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO TRIPADVISOR, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS.

Using our Services, including creating a Tripadvisor account, is free of charge, and a payment will only processed when you book a reservation via the Services. When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation.

The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request.

**Third-Party Suppliers.** The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although users may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by users. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services.

The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below.

**Booking Travel Services via the Tripadvisor Mobile App.**  Some of the travel services booked via Tripadvisor’s mobile app are governed by an additional set of terms of use.  Those terms are available through the app itself and can be found [here](https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/us-terms-of-use-booking).

#### **Booking Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites.** Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travellers’ ability to (1) enter into holiday rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Holiday Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a holiday rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites.  As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Holiday Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage or contract for any Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services.

Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Holiday Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travellers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Holiday Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Holiday Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Holiday Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user.

One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any fee(s) specified to you in advance of you making a booking for any Holiday Rental reservation or Experience and any fees charged to you as a result of damage caused by your use of the Rental reservation or experience in accordance with any applicable terms or policy.

For further information on Holiday Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit [**Viator**](https://www.viator.com/support/termsAndConditions?localeSwitch=1); for Restaurants visit [**The Fork**](https://www.thefork.com/#geo_dmn_redirect=20210629AT100); for holiday rentals, visit [Tripadvisor Companies' Holiday Rentals.](https://rentals.tripadvisor.com/en_US/termsandconditions/traveler) By making a Holiday Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.

If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here: [http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&lng=EN).

**TRAVEL DESTINATIONS**

#### **International Travel.** When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.

For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travellers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveller’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority or country, including countries the traveller may just be passing through en route to his or her destination.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.

Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Tripadvisor urges travellers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at [www.state.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.state.gov), [www.tsa.gov](https://www.tsa.gov/),[www.dot.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.dot.gov), [www.faa.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.faa.gov), [www.cdc.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.cdc.gov), [www.treas.gov/ofac](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.treas.gov/ofac) and [www.customs.gov](file:///C:/Users/emma.finlayson/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/7XIGGZH4/www.customs.gov).

BY LISTING INFORMATION RELEVANT TO TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, THE TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.

THE THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS PROVIDING ACCOMMODATIONS, FLIGHT, RENTALS, EXPERIENCES, RESTAURANTS OR CRUISE INFORMATION, TRAVEL OR OTHER SERVICES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES OF THE TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES. THE TRIPADVISOR COMPANIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR THE ACTS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, BREACHES OR NEGLIGENCE OF ANY SUCH SUPPLIERS OR FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURIES, DEATH, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR OTHER DAMAGES OR EXPENSES RESULTING THEREFROM. TRIPADVISOR HAS NO LIABILITY AND WILL MAKE NO REFUND IN THE EVENT OF ANY DELAY, CANCELLATION, OVERBOOKING, STRIKE, FORCE MAJEURE OR OTHER CAUSES BEYOND ITS DIRECT CONTROL, AND IT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL EXPENSE, OMISSIONS, DELAYS, RE-ROUTING OR ACTS OF ANY GOVERNMENT OR AUTHORITY.

If the Tripadvisor Companies are found liable for any loss or damage that arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Services, then the Tripadvisor Companies’ liability will in no event exceed, in the aggregate, the greater of (a) the transaction fees paid to the Tripadvisor Companies for the transaction(s) on or through the Services giving rise to the claim, or (b) One-Hundred Dollars (US $100.00).

The limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between the parties. The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose. The limitations of liability provided in these terms inure to the benefit of the Tripadvisor Companies.

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE FOREGOING LIABILITY DISCLAIMER DO NOT AFFECT MANDATORY LEGAL RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS IN PLACE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. IN THE UK AND THE EU, THIS INCLUDES LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SUBCONTRACTORS AND FOR FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.

If you are a consumer in the UK or the EU, this Agreement does not exclude any liability for losses and damages caused by a breach of any duty to act with reasonable care and skill or by a breach of this Agreement, provided that the resulting damages were foreseeable when the obligations arose.     

IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW ANY PARTICULAR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE, THAT LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY. THE LIABILITY DISCLAIMER WILL OTHERWISE APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW.

**INDEMNIFICATION**

This section "Indemnification" does not apply to consumers who are resident in the EU or the UK.

You agree to defend and indemnify the Tripadvisor Companies and any of their officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties or other costs or expenses of any kind or nature including but not limited to reasonable legal and accounting fees, brought by third parties as a result of:

* (i) your breach of this Agreement or the documents referenced herein;
* (ii) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or
* (iii) your use of the Services, including the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites.

**LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES**

The Services may contain hyperlinks to websites operated by parties other than the Tripadvisor Companies. Such hyperlinks are provided for your reference only. The Tripadvisor Companies do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy or other practices of such websites. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from this or any other website) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. The Tripadvisor Companies’ inclusion of hyperlinks to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such third party websites or apps or any association with their operators.

In some cases, you may be asked by a third-party site or app to link your Tripadvisor account profile to a profile on another third-party site. You are responsible for deciding if you choose to do so, it is purely optional, and the decision to allow this information to be linked can be disabled (with the third-party site or app) at any time. If you do choose to link your Tripadvisor account to a third party site or app, the third party site or app will be able to access the information you have stored on your Tripadvisor account, including information regarding other users with whom you share information. You should read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the third party sites and apps that you visit as they have rules and permissions about how they use your information that may differ from the Services, including our websites. We encourage you to review these third party sites and apps and to use them at your own risk.

**MODIFICATIONS TO** **THIS AGREEMENT;** **THE SERVICES;** **UPDATES;** **TERMINATION** **AND WITHDRAWAL**

**This Agreement:**

Tripadvisor may change, add or delete these terms and conditions of this Agreement or any portion thereof from time to time in its sole discretion (or in its reasonable discretion for consumers resident in the UK or EU) where we deem it necessary for legal, general regulatory and technical purposes, or due to changes in the Services provided or nature or layout of Services. Thereafter, you expressly agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as amended.

**Modifications:**

The Tripadvisor Companies may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including availability of any of the Services’ features, databases or Content, at any time, without any cost to you, including:

(a)        to ensure compliance with applicable laws and/or reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, such as mandatory consumer laws;

(b)        to perform temporary maintenance, fix bugs, implement technical adjustments, for operational purposes or make improvements, such as adapting the Services to a new technical environment, transferring the Services to a new hosting platform, or ensuring Service compatibility with the devices and software (as updated from time to time);

(c)        to upgrade or amend the Services, including releasing new versions of the websites on certain devices or otherwise amending or making modifications to existing features and functionality;

(d)        to alter the structure, design or layout of the Services, including changing the name of or re-branding the Services, or amending, improving and/or expanding the features and functionalities available; and

(e)        for security reasons.

For UK and EU-based users: If we make any changes to the Services which we reasonably consider will materially negatively impact your access to or use of the Services, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice of the changes. If you do not terminate your contract with us before these changes take place, we will take that as your acceptance of the changes.

**Updates:**

We may make updates to keep the Services in conformity with applicable consumer laws. If automatic updates are switched on in your settings, we will automatically update the Services. You can change your settings at any time if you prefer to no longer receive automatic updates.

To get the best experience and to ensure the Services operate correctly, we recommend that you accept any updates to the Services that we inform you about as and when they become available. This may also require you to update your device operating system. As and when new operating systems and devices are released, we may over time stop supporting older versions.

If you choose not to download or install any updates, the Services may no longer be available, supported, or have previous functionality.

We are not responsible for your failure to download or install any update or the most recent published version of the Services in order to benefit from new or improved features and/or functionality and/or meet compatibility requirements where we have informed you about the update, explained the consequences of failing to install it and provided installation instructions.

Any changes to the Service not in accordance with this "Updates" provision will be subject to the "Modifications" section above.

**Termination:**

The Tripadvisor Companies may also impose limits or otherwise restrict your access to all or parts of the Services without notice or liability for technical or security reasons, to prevent against unauthorised access, loss of, or destruction of data or where Tripadvisor and/or its corporate affiliates consider(s) in its/their sole discretion (or in its/their reasonable discretion for consumers resident in the UK or EU) that you are in breach of any provision of this Agreement or of any law or regulation and where Tripadvisor and/or its corporate affiliates decide to discontinue providing any aspect of the Services.

Tripadvisor may terminate this Agreement with you at any time, without advanced notice, where it believes in good faith that you have breached this Agreement or otherwise believes that termination is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or others users of the Services. That means that we may stop providing you with Services.

**JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW**

This website is owned and controlled by Tripadvisor LLC, a U.S. limited liability company. This Agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Massachusetts, USA and stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceedings in such courts for all disputes, both contractual and non-contractual, arising out of or relating to the use of the Services by you or any third party. You agree that all claims you may have against Tripadvisor LLC arising from or relating to the Services must be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Use of the Services is unauthorised in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these terms and conditions, including, without limitation, this paragraph. Nothing in this clause shall limit the right of Tripadvisor LLC to take proceedings against you in any other court, or courts, of competent jurisdiction. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent that applicable law in your country of residence requires application of another law and/or jurisdiction – in particular, if you are using the Services as a consumer – and this cannot be excluded by contract and will not be governed by the United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, if otherwise applicable.  If you use the Services as a consumer, and not as business or Business Representative, you may be entitled to bring claims against Tripadvisor in the Courts of your country of residence. This clause shall otherwise apply to the maximum extent allowed in your country or residence.

**CURRENCY CONVERTER**

Currency rates are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified as accurate, and actual rates may vary. Currency quotes may not be updated on a daily basis. The information supplied is believed to be accurate, but the Tripadvisor Companies do not warrant or guarantee such accuracy. When using this information for any financial purpose, we advise you to consult a qualified professional to verify the accuracy of the currency rates. We do not authorise the use of this information for any purpose other than your personal use and you are expressly prohibited from the resale, redistribution and use of this information for commercial purposes.

**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

We reserve the right to reclaim any username, account name, nickname, handle or any other user identifier for any reason without liability to you.

You agree that no joint venture, agency, partnership or employment relationship exists between you and Tripadvisor and/or its corporate affiliates as a result of this Agreement or use of the Services.

Our performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this Agreement limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of the Services within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.

If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions in this Agreement shall continue in effect.

This Agreement (and any other terms and conditions referenced herein) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Tripadvisor with respect to the Services and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Tripadvisor with respect to the Services. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement are available in the language of the Tripadvisor websites and/or apps on which Services may be accessed.

The websites and/or apps on which Services may be accessed may not always be updated on a periodic or regular basis and consequently are not required to register as editorial product under any relevant law.

Fictitious names of companies, products, people, characters and/or data mentioned in, on or through the Services are not intended to represent any real individual, company, product or event.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits, save that Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates shall be deemed express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
