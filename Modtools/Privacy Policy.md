Privacy
=======

We wonâ€™t pass on your email address to any organisation outside Freegle, and other freeglers can't see it.

Other freeglers can see your name, profile picture and approximate location. If you don't want that, you can change it in [Settings](https://modtools.org/settings).

We try to protect you from spammers and fraudsters. Sometimes our volunteers may read what you write to check that it's not spam, phishing or fraud. If we happen to find something which is against Freegle rules, we may take further action.

If you put phone numbers, email addresses or postal addresses into your posts on Freegle, other people will be able to see them. If you're concerned about this, don't do it!

So that potential new users can see what is being offered on Freegle, we make some details of posts public, i.e. the item name, approximate location, the description and any photos. No personal details are made public unless in this information.

Norfolk Freegle is a separate legal entity, which is affiliated with Freegle UK, and we share data (in technical GDPR terms this is a joint controller arrangement).

Cookies and Tracking
--------------------

You'll have seen lots of irritating popups on websites about consent for cookies. We don't have one of those because we don't store any data for logged out visitors which would require that consent.

Here are some technical details on what happens when you're logged out.

* We store a session cookie. That's strictly necessary for the site to function, and does not require consent.
* We store some information in your browser's local storage, because of the way the site works. There's not much in it except if you're trying to reply to a post. That's like the "shopping cart" example in the Information Commissioner's [advice](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/) and does not require consent.
* We use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to collect traffic statistics. This is configured in a way that means it [does not require consent](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28367/gdpr-whats-classed-as-an-opt-in-for-google-analytics-cookie-and-do-i-need-to) We have a data processing agreement with Google, we have enabled IP anonymization/masking, disabled data sharing, and are not using any other google services in combination with Google Analytics.
* We use Google and Facebook's code to allow you to log in. They store a few third-party cookies, of their own, but before you've logged in they don't know who you are. If you are concerned about these, you can install a privacy blocker such as [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) and still use the site (but it helps if you [donate](https://modtools.org/donate)).

Once you log in, you're giving us consent to do the following.

* We store more information in your local storage. Part of this is so that you don't need to log in as often, and the rest is to speed up the site (it's a cache).
* We show jobs ads from [WhatJobs](https://uk.whatjobs.com/), both on the site and in emails. We'd prefer not to, but we don't raise enough from [donations](https://modtools.org/donate) alone to keep going. We don't pass them any information at all unless you click on one of the job links, not even your IP address.

Sentry
------

When something goes wrong on the website, we log it to a third party site call [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). They help organise the logs and make it easier for us to identify and fix problems. This [should not include](https://docs.sentry.io/data-management/sensitive-data/) any of your personal data. You can read their privacy policy [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

Inspectlet
----------

On a small random fraction of sessions, we use [Inspectlet](https://www.inspectlet.com/). This helps us work out which bits of the website are working well for freeglers, and which aren't. You can read their privacy policy [here](https://docs.inspectlet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002994432-Privacy-Impact-Assessment-under-GDPR), and opt out of this [here](https://www.inspectlet.com/optout).

Deleting your data
------------------

If you want to leave Freegle, please go [here](https://modtools.org/unsubscribe).

Once you leave, this will delete all your personal data.

Got questions?
--------------

Privacy is a complicated and important area, which we take seriously. If you have questions or concerns, please [contact us.](https://modtools.org/help)
