11   Governing Law; Arbitration.
================================

11.1   **Governing Law.** The Terms (and any disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them or the Services) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States (including federal arbitration law) and the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Gimlet agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Terms (and any disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them or the Services) that is not subject to arbitration will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Southern District of New York.

  

The dispute resolution and arbitration provisions set forth in Sections 11.2 - 11.7 apply only to users in the United States.

  

11.2   **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.** You and Gimlet agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Gimlet arising in connection with or relating in any way to the Terms or to your relationship with Gimlet as a user of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Gimlet further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Terms.

11.3   **Exceptions.** Notwithstanding Section 11.1 above, you and Gimlet both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (a) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (b) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).

11.4   **No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver.** YOU AND Gimlet AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Gimlet agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

11.5   **Arbitration rules.** Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Gimlet will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Gimlet agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Gimlet can also help put you in touch with the AAA. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Gimlet will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Gimlet will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

11.6   **Notice; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Gimlet's address for Notice is: Gimlet USA Inc. Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Gimlet may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Gimlet shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Gimlet’s last written settlement offer, then Gimlet will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.

11.7   **Enforceability.** If this Arbitration provision is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 11.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Terms.
