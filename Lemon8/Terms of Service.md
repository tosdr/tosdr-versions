### 1.Your Relationship With Us

Welcome to Lemon8 (the “**Platform**”), , which is provided by Heliophilia Pte. Ltd. or its affiliates (collectively such entities will be referred to as “**Lemon8**”, “**we**” or “**us**”).

You are reading the terms of service (the “**Terms**”), which govern the relationship and serve as an agreement between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Platform and our related websites, services, applications, products and content (collectively, the “**Services**”). Our Services are provided for private, non-commercial use. For purposes of the Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services. The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and us. Please take the time to read them carefully.

### 2.Accepting the Terms

By accessing or using our Services, you confirm that you can form a binding contract with Lemon8, that you accept the Terms and that you agree to comply with them. Your access to and use of our Services is also subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.lemon8-app.com/legal/privacy?region=us&language=en) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.lemon8-app.com/community-guideline?region=us&language=en), the terms of which can be found directly on the Platform, or where the Platform is made available for download, on your mobile device’s applicable app store, and are incorporated herein by reference. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.lemon8-app.com/legal/privacy?region=us&language=en).

If you access or use the Services from within a jurisdiction for which there are separate supplemental terms, you also agree to the supplemental terms applicable to you in the applicable jurisdiction as outlined below and agree to comply with them. If there is a conflict between the provisions of the supplemental terms that are applicable to you, and the rest of the Terms, the relevant jurisdictions’ supplemental terms will supersede and control. If you do not agree to the Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services.

If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of a business or entity, then (a) “you” and “your” includes you and that business or entity, (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the business or entity with the authority to bind the entity to the Terms, and that you agree to the Terms on the entity’s behalf, and (c) your business or entity is legally and financially responsible for your access or use of the Services as well as for the access or use of your account by others affiliated with your entity, including any employees, agents or contractors.

We amend the Terms from time to time, for instance when we update the functionality of our Services, when we combine multiple apps or services operated by us or our affiliates into a single combined service or app, or when there are regulatory changes. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes to the Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform, however, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms, which reflect the effective date of such Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services.

Use of the Lemon8 Content or materials on the Services for any purpose not expressly permitted by the Terms is strictly prohibited. Such content may not be downloaded, copied, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, performed, adapted, edited, published, sold, licensed or otherwise exploited for any purpose whatsoever without our or, where applicable, our licensors’ prior written consent. We and our licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to their content.

**NO RIGHTS ARE LICENSED WITH RESPECT TO SOUND RECORDINGS AND THE MUSICAL WORKS EMBODIED THEREIN THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE FROM OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.**

You acknowledge and agree that when you view content provided by others on the Services, you are doing so at your own risk. The content on our Services is provided for general information only. It is not intended to amount to advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of the content on our Services.

We make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that any Lemon8 Content (including User Content) is accurate, complete or up to date. Where our Services contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only. We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you and other users on the Services (including User Content).

#### B. User-Generated Content

Users of the Services may be permitted to upload, post or transmit (such as via a stream) or otherwise make available content through the Services including, without limitation, any text, photographs, videos, sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein, and videos that incorporate locally stored sound recordings from your personal music library and ambient noise (“**User Content**”). Users of the Services may also extract all or any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one user. Users of the Services may also overlay music, graphics, stickers and other elements provided by Lemon8 (“**Lemon8 Elements**”) onto this User Content and transmit this User Content through the Services. The information and materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes Lemon8 Elements, have not been verified or approved by us. The views expressed by other users on the Services do not represent our views or values.

Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to upload or transmit User Content through the Services (including via certain third-party social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter), or to make contact with other users of the Services, you must comply with the standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services” above. You may also choose to upload or transmit your User Content, on sites or platforms hosted by third parties. If you decide to do this, you must comply with their content guidelines as well as with the standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services” above.

You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you will be liable to us and indemnify us for any breach of that warranty. This means you will be responsible for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of your breach of warranty.

Any User Content will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You must not post any User Content on or through the Services or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. When you submit User Content through the Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services, to transmit it from the Services to other third-party platforms, and/or adopt any third-party content.

If you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not post such sound recordings to the Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services.

You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us, but by submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable and sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, perform, display, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other users of the Services and other third-parties to view, access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, perform, display, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented. You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your username, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of any of your User Content.

The rights granted in the preceding paragraphs of this Section (7.B) include, but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform, publicly display and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting us the right to use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, etc.) (a “**PRO**”) or a collective management organization (e.g. JASARC, NextTone, etc.) （a “**CMO**”）, a sound recording PRO (e.g., SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of User Content.

**Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists.** If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO/CMO, then you must notify your PRO/CMO of the royalty-free license you grant through the Terms in your User Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO/CMO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in the Terms in your User Content or have such music publisher enter into the Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses in the Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your label.

**Through-To-The-Audience Rights.** All of the rights you grant in your User Content in the Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third-party services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content posted or used on such third-party service via the Services.

Waiver of Rights to User Content. By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you post to or through the Services.

We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy.

We, or authorised third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, your content at our or their sole discretion. We have the right to remove, disallow, block or delete any posting you make on our Services if, in our opinion, your post does not comply with the content standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our Services” above. In addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider violates the Terms, or (ii) in response to complaints from other users or third parties, without any liability to you. We may or may not notify you of such removal, disallowance, blocking or deletion. As a result, we recommend that you save copies of any User Content that you post to the Services on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Content. We do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User Content.

You control whether your User Content is made publicly available on the Services to all other users of the Services or only available to people you approve. To restrict access to your User Content, you should select the privacy setting available within the Platform.

We accept no liability in respect of any content submitted by users and published by us or by authorised third parties. If you wish to file a complaint about information or materials uploaded by other users, contact us at: [contact@lemon8-app.com](mailto:contact@lemon8-app.com).

Lemon8 takes reasonable measures to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. **It is Lemon8’s policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to disable or terminate the accounts of users of the Services who repeatedly infringe copyrights or intellectual property rights of others.**

While our own staff is continually working to develop and evaluate our own product ideas and features, we pride ourselves on paying close attention to the interests, feedback, comments, and suggestions we receive from the user community. If you choose to contribute by sending us or our employees any ideas for products, services, features, modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies, content offerings (such as audio, visual, games, or other types of content), promotions, strategies, or product/feature names, or any related documentation, artwork, illustration, computer code, diagrams, or other materials (collectively “Feedback”), then regardless of what your accompanying communication may say, the following terms will apply. Accordingly, by sending Feedback to us, you agree that:

* **i.** Lemon8 has no obligation to review, consider, or implement your Feedback, or to return to you all or part of any Feedback for any reason;
    
* **ii.** Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis, and we are not under any obligation to keep any Feedback you send confidential or to refrain from using or disclosing it in any way; and
    
* **iii.** You irrevocably grant us perpetual and unlimited permission to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, modify, publicly perform (including on a through-to-the-audience basis), communicate to the public, make available, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose and without restriction, free of charge and without attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing, and promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback, whether in whole or in part, and whether as provided or as modified.

**c.Links.** You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it.

Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specific
------------------------------------------

**US.**

**ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.** This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.

Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Lemon8, you will first contact Lemon8 and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.

Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Lemon8’s services and/or products, including the Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Lemon8 or any other user of the Services, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Lemon8. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Lemon8 for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Services by following the procedure described below.

You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Lemon8 are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.

If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to:

Heliophilia Pte. Ltd., 1 Raffles Quay, #26-10, South Tower, Singapore 048583

Email Address: [contact@lemon8-app.com](mailto:contact@lemon8-app.com)

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.lemon8-app.com/legal/www.adr.org) or by calling 1-800-778-7879.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.

If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Lemon8 and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [contact@lemon8-app.com](mailto:contact@lemon8-app.com) within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Services.

**Class Action Waiver.** Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.

If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Lemon8 each waive any right to a jury trial.
