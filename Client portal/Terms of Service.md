Terms of Service | Client Portal
================================

Client Portal Terms of Service
------------------------------

### The Agreement

This is a legal agreement between the person or organization ("Customer", "Buyer" or "you") agreeing to these Terms of Service ("Terms") and the applicable Client Portal licensing entities ("Client Portal","Laurium Design Ltd", "Seller", "us," or "we"). By accepting these Terms, making a purchase, or using any Services provided by us, you represent that you are of legal age and have the authority to bind the Customer to the Order, these Terms, and any applicable Service Descriptions (collectively the "Agreement").

Our website grants you non-exclusive limited license to use the Client Portal plugin and other products sold through our website ([https://client-portal.io](https://client-portal.io/)) by Laurium Design Ltd (the "products") in accordance with these Terms & Conditions (the "license) issued by our company.

### 1\. Plugin Licensing

Client Portal is licensed under the GNU general public license ([http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)).

### 2\. Automatic Upgrades

Automatic Upgrades are available to customers who have purchased a support license in accordance with the license they have purchased. You may not share or resell access to your support license key if you are on the single site license. For multisite, you may share the license key (e.g. with your clients) but not resell Client Portal in it's entirety.

Upgrades are provided for a term of 12 months from the time of purchase (unless otherwise stated when you purchase). After 12 months the license will need to be renewed in order to continue receiving support and product upgrades.

### 3\. Delivery

After we have successfully processed your payment, you will receive an email with the download link and support license key. This may take up to 1 hour to arrive, but usually happens within minutes of placing the order. If you do not receive an email after this time period, please [contact us](mailto:support@lauraelizabeth.co).

### 4\. Ownership

You may not claim intellectual or exclusive ownership rights to any of our products. All products are property of Laurium Design Ltd. They are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages or losses that occur out of the use or inability to use our products.

### 5\. Site Content

All site content, including imagery and documentation that is published on client-portal.io is the property of Laurium Design Ltd. Any replicated site content must be authorized in advance. Content from this site shall not be used or exploited for commercial or non-commercial purposes without the prior written consent of Laurium Design Ltd.

### 6\. Refunds

We will be happy to consider a refund **within the first 30 days of your original purchase or annual subscription renewal** and will be granted in the sole discretion of Laurium Design Ltd. Refund requests must include the license key, transaction ID, the date of purchase and the purchaser's email address. Requests with incomplete or inaccurate information will be disregarded.

**REFUNDS WILL ONLY BE GRANTED FOR THE ORIGINAL LICENSE PURCHASE and DO NOT APPLY to product upgrades. No partial refunds will be granted for license downgrades, early termination, un-applied discount/coupon codes, etc.**

By upgrading the software license, the buyer agrees they have had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods/software and signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that the buyer will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity. **At that point (even if the upgrade was within 30 days of the original purchase date) any upgrade amounts paid as well as the original purchase amount are no longer eligible for a refund.**

Refund requests may take up to 14 days to process. All refunds will be granted at the sole discretion of Laurium Design Ltd. **Absolutely no refunds will be given after 30 days from the original purchase.**

We reserve the right to refuse refund requests for customers who have previously purchased and obtained refunds for a Client Portal license.

Please note that by purchasing the plugin, you agreed to the [terms & conditions of use](https://client-portal.io/terms-of-service/) including the Refund Policy.

If you believe you are eligible for a refund based on these criteria, you may request a refund.

We reserve the right to change or modify the current refund policy with no prior notice.

### 7\. Support

Laurium Design Ltd. offers WordPress plugins "as is" and with no implied meaning that they will function exactly as you would like or will be compatible with all 3rd party components and plugins.

Support is offered to customers with a valid Client Portal license key. Purchasing a license key gives you access to our support resources and email support.

Support and automatic product updates are provided for a term of 12 months from the time of purchase unless otherwise stated at time of purchase. After 12 months the license will need to be renewed in order to continue receiving support and product updates.

The license key and support account are registered to the email address of the **original purchaser**. The original purchaser (license holder) retains the rights to the license and account **even if the account/key is renewed or upgraded by another party**. Only the license holder is permitted to request support or access support resources.

**License holders cannot distribute, freely giveaway, or resell their license key**. The license key is only transferable by contacting us and requesting an official transfer of the license to a new owner. The license is intended to be used on the license holder's web site(s). Client site usage is permitted for the multisite license in situations where the license holder maintains an ongoing relationship with the client as a consultant.

License holders are not permitted to re-post support email content or documentation on any external websites, social media outlets, etc. Posting screen captures of this content is also prohibited. Violation will be grounds for immediate termination of the support license and all access to support content and product updates will be discontinued.

### 8\. Transactional Emails

Laurium Design Ltd may on occasion send you email notifications related to your Client Portal license and other promotions that Laurium Design Ltd offers. These transactional emails may include notification of licensing changes, changes to our terms and conditions, license expiration notices and other transactional emails related to your purchase of Client Portal. By purchasing Client Portal you agree to receive these transactional emails. Laurium Design Ltd will not sell or share your information with any other 3rd party. Customers may unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

### 9\. Account Suspension

Laurium Design Ltd reserves the right, at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, a support license with or without notice. If an account is suspended no refund will be granted.

### 10\. Pricing/Recurring Billing/Payment Methods

We reserve the right to modify the renewal pricing of an existing license either temporarily or for the future lifetime of the license.

Notification will be made via electronic mail, using the email address listed by the user on their Client Portal account. It the responsibility of the user to ensure that their email address is kept up to date within their Client Portal account. We reserve the right to not honor typographical errors which may cause incorrect pricing on the website.

**Recurring Billing.** By purchasing, renewing or upgrading a Client Portal support license and providing a valid Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a license renewal fee at the specified rate to your Payment Method on future anniversary dates. The amount and future billing date will be clearly stated in the My Account section of our website for each support license you own. This may be cancelled by you at any time, see "Cancellation" below. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated, for a period that extends beyond the license expiry date.

### 11\. Cancellation

You may cancel your license at any time, and you will continue to have access to downloads and support services until the listed expiry date of the license. ONCE CANCELLED, A LICENSE CANNOT BE RENEWED OR UPGRADED, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE EXPIRY DATE HAS PASSED OR NOT.
