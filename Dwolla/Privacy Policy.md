In order to submit a verifiable consumer request to Dwolla, the request must both provide sufficient detail for Dwolla to be able to appropriately ascertain your identity and give sufficient clarity for Dwolla to understand the nature of the request. Dwolla will determine the criteria for a verifiable consumer request based upon the nature of the request and account.

If you have submitted a verifiable consumer request, Dwolla will respond in a timely manner consistent with applicable law. If Dwolla is unable to verify or denies your request, Dwolla will submit an appropriate response. If you would like to appeal our decision to deny your request, please do so by using the secure messaging portal that we emailed to you after you submitted a data subject rights request. If you have any questions or concerns please email us at [privacy@dwolla.com](mailto:privacy@dwolla.com).
