We aim to collect the minimum amount of information required to operate our Services.

IMPORTANT: YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PERSONAL DATA MAY MAKE OUR SERVICES OPERATE NOT AS INTENDED OR NOT OPERATE AT ALL FOR YOU. YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PERSONAL DATA MAY ALSO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO PROVIDE SOME OF OUR SERVICES TO YOU BECAUSE OUR SERVICES REQUIRE CERTAIN MINIMUM PERSONAL DATA IN ORDER TO OPERATE AS WE INTEND.

### 2.1. VPN Products

As stated above, our VPN Products consist of VPN Unlimited, VPN Lite, DNS Firewall by KeepSolid, and Private Browser.

**Please note!** All of our VPN Products follow a strict no-logging policy.
