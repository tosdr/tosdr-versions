### Definitions

1. The **data controller** is the person or company that, together or jointly with others, determines the purposes (why) and means (how) of the processing of personal data.

2. **Personal data** is any information that relates to an individual who is identified or identifiable, for instance by reference to a name, an identification number or an online identifier.

3. **Standard Contractual Clauses** are an agreement that can be entered into by companies for transfers of personal data outside of the European Union.
