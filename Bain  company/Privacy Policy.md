    If you apply for a job at Bain, you will be asked to submit information to Bain such as your name, contact details, information about your education and work history and any other background information that might be relevant for your application or that you choose to share with Bain. If you do not provide this information to us, we might not be able to process your application.

    We might share your personal data with other companies in the Bain group as well as with third parties such as recruitment service providers, background check providers and IT system providers. These Bain companies and third parties might be located in a different country than your country of residence. In particular, if you apply for a consulting role, your data will be stored in a third party database hosted in the Netherlands.

### Definitions

1. The **data controller** is the person or company that, together or jointly with others, determines the purposes (why) and means (how) of the processing of personal data.

2. **Personal data** is any information that relates to an individual who is identified or identifiable, for instance by reference to a name, an identification number or an online identifier.

3. **Standard Contractual Clauses** are an agreement that can be entered into by companies for transfers of personal data outside of the European Union.
