### Notice specific to documents available on this website

Documents published by Nuance on their Worldwide Web Servers are provided "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. Nuance shall not under any circumstances be liable to any person for any special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including, without limitation, damages resulting from use of OR RELIANCE ON the INFORMATION presented, loss of profits or revenues or costs of replacement goods, even if informed in advance of the possibility of such damages.

Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information presented. However, Nuance assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the information. Product information is subject to change without notice. Changes, if any, will be incorporated in new editions of these publications. Nuance may make improvements and/or changes in the products and/or the programs described in these publications at any time without notice. Mention of non-Nuance products or services is for information purposes only and constitutes neither an endorsement nor a recommendation.

### Use of services

Any material, information or other communication you transmit or post to this Site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary ("Communications"). Nuance will have no obligations with respect to the Communications. Nuance and its designees will be free to copy, disclose, distribute, incorporate and otherwise use the Communications and all data, images, sounds, text and other things embodied therein for any and all commercial or non-commercial purposes. You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this Site any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic or other material that would violate any state, federal or international law.

### Privacy policy

Information submitted to Nuance through forms on their Worldwide Web Servers is governed according to [Nuance's privacy policy.](http://www.nuance.com/company/company-overview/company-policies/privacy-policies/index.htm)

### Links to third-party sites

Web sites linked to by Nuance are not under the control of Nuance, and Nuance is not responsible for the content of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site. Nuance reserves the right to terminate any link or linking program at any time. Nuance does not endorse companies or products to which it links and reserves the right to note as such on its web pages. If you decide to access any of the third-party sites linked to this Site, you do this entirely at your own risk.

### Trademarks

All product and brand names are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders.

Products and services may vary from country to country. Please contact your local Nuance representative for specific information.

### Software piracy

Each copy of Dragon is licensed for use by a single user. When you purchase a genuine copy of Dragon, you become a licensed user and have purchased the right to use the software for a specific user. It is against the law to give copies to friends and colleagues or to sell copies of the software to others. The unauthorized copying of software is called piracy.

Each copy of Dragon must be activated prior to use. This helps us to discourage the piracy of our software and protects our customers from the risks of illegal and fake software. In addition to potential viruses, pirated software does not offer the support, warranties and updates received with genuine copies of Dragon. Unfortunately, this process doesn't stop all software piracy. Some people continue to sell fake or illegal copies of Dragon, particularly through Internet storefronts or online auction sites.

Since there are many legitimate online retailers of Dragon, it may be difficult to spot online piracy. Before buying online, be sure to review the company's name, full address and phone number. Inquire about the company's return policy, as well as service and warranty information. Ask directly if the software has been used or installed before. To be sure that you are purchasing a genuine copy of Dragon, we encourage you to buy your products either directly from Nuance or from one of our [authorized resellers.](https://www.nuance.com/dragon/for-partners.html)

If you mistakenly purchased a pirated copy of Dragon, it is not supported by Nuance as we can’t confirm the quality and full functionality of pirated products. Although Nuance regularly monitors the market for pirated versions of our software to protect our customer base, we can’t be responsible for the activities of those who illegally copy the software. You will need to return the software to its original source.
