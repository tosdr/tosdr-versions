**1\. ABOUT MENUFY**

Menufy allows customers to order meals and beverages from restaurants through Menufy’s website and mobile application.  Although you place orders through our Site, we do not prepare your order, food, or beverages; rather, we connect you with restaurants through our Site and process orders placed through the Site.  Menufy requires restaurants to comply with all applicable laws and safety regulations regarding your order and food preparation.  Menufy, however, cannot verify every restaurant’s compliance with all laws and regulations for every order placed through our Site.  Menufy does not verify a restaurant’s ingredients, menus, or representations regarding its food or food preparation.  You are advised to contact the restaurant directly should you have any food allergens or questions about your order with the restaurant.  By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you understand and agree Menufy will not be responsible for a restaurant’s ingredients or representations made about its food.
