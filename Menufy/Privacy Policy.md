Your Privacy Choices and Rights
-------------------------------

You may have certain choices and rights regarding our processing of your personal information under applicable data privacy laws, including if you are a California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia resident. These rights may include:

* request a copy of your personal information;
    
* correct the personal information we hold about you;
    
* request deletion of your personal information;
    
* opt-out of “sharing” of personal information for “cross-contextual behavioral advertising” purposes (as these terms are defined under applicable law);
    
* opt out of targeted advertising;
    
* opt out of certain profiling activities;
    
* ask that we provide your personal information in a format that would facilitate its transfer to another organization, or to you, in certain circumstances (referred to as the right to data portability);
    
* not be unlawfully discriminated against for exercising your rights;
    

These rights may be limited or denied in some circumstances under applicable local law. If we deny a request, we will explain why in accordance with applicable local law.

To exercise your available rights or if you are an authorized personal representative seeking to exercise rights on behalf of someone else, please contact us at [support@menufy.com](mailto:support@menufy.com?) or contact us via the contact information listed at the bottom of this page. To opt out of our “sharing” of your personal information, where such opt-out if afforded by local law, please submit a request labeled “Request to Opt Out” to [support@menufy.com](mailto:support@menufy.com?). 

Upon receipt of your request, we will ask you to provide certain personal information to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, telephone number, zip code, and/or purchase history, in order for us to determine if your information is in our systems and to verify your identity. We will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law. This may require that we request additional information from you to protect against fraudulent rights requests. To the extent we request such information from you, we will not use this information for purposes unrelated to verifying your identity. Please note that, to the extent you are an authorized personal representative seeking to exercise rights on behalf of someone else (where permitted by local law), we may request that you provide us with documentation regarding your authority under such applicable law and we also may seek additional verification directly with the individual whose rights are being exercised.

You may have the right to appeal a decision we make regarding requests to exercise rights under this Policy. To appeal a decision, please contact us at the contact information listed below.

Safeguarding Information

If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

HungerRush does not knowingly disclose the personal information of children under 16 years of age to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration or for the purpose of targeted advertising (i.e., “sell” or “share,” as those terms are defined under applicable data privacy laws).
