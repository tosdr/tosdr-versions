Privacy Policy
--------------

GoZone WiFi LLC is a software as a service company based in the United States that enables its clients to gather guest intelligence and platforms to engage with guests that connect to Wi-Fi networks that are owned and operated by those clients. GoZone WiFi LLC is committed to protecting the privacy of our users’ personal information. This Privacy Statement provides information explaining how GoZoneWiFi.com and related sites collects, uses, and shares information collected from our website, as well as the choices you have regarding our use of this information. This Privacy Policy covers the company GoZone WiFi, LLC., its subsidiaries, and any products or trade names associated with the company. These are referred to as “GoZone”, “GZ” “we,” “us,” and “our” throughout this policy. This Privacy Policy applies to our GZ tools and software products, including all GZ websites, apps, and online services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, “our Services”).

**TO OPT-OUT**  
**IF YOU DO NOT WANT US TO COLLECT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, CLOSE THIS BROWSER WINDOW, DISCONNECT FROM THE GOZONE WIFI POWERED NETWORK AND DISABLE ANY WIFI-ENABLED DEVICES IF YOU ARE IN OR NEAR A GOZONE WIFI POWERED HOTSPOT VENUE.** 

You agree that all transactions relating to our Services shall be deemed to have occurred in the United States, where we currently have all our personnel and operations. Your information collected through the Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which GZ or our subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to such transfer. If you are a resident of the EU or the State of California, you are protected under the [GDPR or the CCPA (respectively.)](https://support.smartwifiplatform.com/gdpr-form/)

OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

Under applicable law, we are considered the “data controller” of the personal data we collect through our website. We are a data processor of (1) personal data of end users provided directly to us by our clients and (2) personal data we process in the course of operating our clients’ websites or analyzing their email marketing campaigns. We are a data controller of all other personal data we obtain in the course of our relationship with our clients, including: (1) information you provide through your use of the WiFi, including automatically-collected information; and (2) any additional data provided by you directly to us or through our business partners. This means that we are responsible for deciding how to collect, use and disclose this data, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears at the end of this Privacy Policy.

The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing of your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:

* Contractual Commitments: We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, to comply with our Terms of Use, which you accept by accessing or otherwise using the WiFi or our website(s).
* With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent. For example, when you registered and consented to our Enhanced Wi-Fi, you consented to our use of your information for marketing purposes.
* Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Wi-Fi and Enhanced Wi-Fi, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.
* Legal Compliance: We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.

**California Privacy Rights**

Under California Civil Code § 1798.83, we are required to disclose to consumers the following information upon written request: (1) the categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties within the prior year, if that information was subsequently used for marketing purposes; and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties to whom such personal information was disclosed.

**Right To Opt Out Of Sale**  
If your personal information is subject to a sale you have the right to opt-out from that sale through a link to a website which will be given to you at the moment of collection of personal information. We will respect your decision to opt out for at least 12 months before asking you again to authorize the sale of your personal information.

**Request Submission**  
You can submit your requests using contacts indicated below or using the CCPA form linked in this section. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, you may be permitted to request the removal of certain content that you have posted on our websites. You can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.

**Links to Other Websites**  
This Privacy Statement only addresses GZ’s collection, use, and disclosure of your information through our website(s) and Services. GoZone WiFi may contain links to other websites with privacy practices that differ from those of GoZone WiFi. If you choose to click on a link and visit another website, please be aware that your information will be governed by that website’s privacy policy. For example, our website includes social media Features such as Facebook Share and other widgets. These Features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing the feature or widget. We encourage you to carefully read and review the policies and practices of the websites you visit.

**Definitions**  
We understand that Privacy Statements can often contain confusing terminology. To help you better understand our privacy practices, here is what we mean when we say:

* **Cookies:** Cookies are small text files created by a web server that are delivered through a web browser and stored on your computer or device. Cookies are used to identify your computer or device and record your preferences and other data so that the website can personalize your visit(s). There are several types of cookies. For example, many websites use their own cookies, called “first-party cookies,” to make their websites run more smoothly by doing things like keeping track of items in your shopping cart. Some websites also provide space for “third-party cookies,” which are placed on your browser by companies different from the company that runs the website you are visiting and may be used to remember parts of your online activities in order to deliver personalized ads or analyze web traffic.
* **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Information that directly identifies or reasonably can be used to figure out the identity of a user, such as your name, address, phone number, and email address. Personal information does not include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.
* **Web Beacons:** A small, transparent graphic image (also known as a tracking pixel) located on a web page or HTML email that is often used with a cookie. Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small and the same color as the background of the Web page or email message.
* **WiFi Probe Requests:** All WiFi-enabled devices send out requests that contain information about your device. A probe request is a special frame sent by your device requesting information from either a specific access point, specified by SSID, or all access points in the area, specified with the broadcast SSID. The information being requested in a probe includes the supported data rates, which are also included in the beacon frames typically broadcast from an access point. If you do not want information to be sent from your device, you must disable WiFi before entering an area with tracking capability.
