Billing Policy
==============

**General Billing:**  
Usage of GoZone products and services constitutes customer’s acceptance of GoZone’s Billing Policy, and all customers must comply with this Billing Policy.

Special note regarding signed agreements: If you entered into a signed agreement for your services, please review your agreement for specific terms relating to your obligations in addition to this Billing Policy. In the event the terms of your signed agreement conflict with these terms, the signed agreement will prevail.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all services are set up on a prepaid basis, and payment must be received by GoZone before any billable product and service is provided/activated.

Unless other arrangements are made with Billing Department, customers are required to keep a valid credit/debit card on file to charge for the recurring monthly license(s), service(s), consulting, and overage fees.  Customers are responsible for keeping all credit/debit card details and contact information current. This can be done online through the GoZone Billing Portal.

All recurring subscriptions and service fees are automatically invoiced and charged to the credit/debit card on file or paid via check or using PayPal, EFT, or Wire Transfer. Any Ads4WiFi Ad Space revenue will be applied solely to GoZone invoices and shall expire in 12 months if not applied.

Payment receipts are sent to customers via email or available through the Billing Portal.

**Subscription Billing:**  
Invoices are generated and payments are collected at the beginning of each billing period. Customer billing periods typically begin on the day of the month in which the customer purchased the GoZone service.

**Fixed Licensed Billing:**  
If you are on one of our fixed access-point-based licensing plans, you will be invoiced 10 days prior to the expiration of your current license key. Payment must be received by the renewal invoice due date or the licenses will be deactivated and functionality to access points will stop until payment has been received.

**Billing Cycles:**  
Services that have a quarterly, annual, bi-annual, tri-annual billing cycle are invoiced 30 days prior to the service renewal date, all other services and billing cycles will invoice 10 days prior to the service renewal date. All invoices with payment methods on file will be charged automatically on the invoice due date.

**Payment Methods:**  
GoZone accepts payments via credit/debit card, check, PayPal, EFT, and Wire Transfer. GoZone currently accepts American Express, MasterCard, Discover, and VISA credit/debit cards. For PayPal payments, please use the PayPal link provided with your invoice.  EFT and Wire Transfer limits may apply, please contact the [Billing Department](emailto:billing@gozonewifi.com) for more information and wire transfer instructions. We reserve the right to charge fees to offset payment costs for credit & debit cards or any other method where we incur a processing fee and it is allowed by law.

**Non-Payment/Suspension:**  
Past due accounts may be suspended after the invoice due date until the balance is paid in full. When suspended, all access to your dashboard account will be disabled and data will be unavailable. Suspended services will continue to incur monthly service fees while suspended.

**Termination:**  
Once an account is past due for 30 days after the invoice due date, Service(s)may be terminated at GoZone’s discretion due to non-payment. Once terminated, all Customer and Guest Data may be deleted. In this event, the account record, past due balance, and any remaining services fees will be submitted to a third-party collection service.

**Fees:**  
Late Fee: GoZone reserves the right to assess a $30.00 late fee or charge the account interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum interest rate allowed by applicable law for any payment that is past due.

Charge-backs: If a customer initiates a charge-back, GoZone may assess a $50.00 processing fee for each individual charge-back.

Returned Checks: GoZone may assess a $50.00 processing fee on each returned check.

Collections Fee: In the event, an account is submitted to a third-party collections service, the customer will be responsible for the cost of collections. This fee is in addition to any other fees previously assessed on the account.

GoZone Hardware Fees: If any GoZone owned equipment is not returned within 30 days of cancellation request or is lost, stolen, or damaged, GoZone will charge the customer for the cost of equipment (not to exceed $200 per Smart WiFi controller).

Credit/Debit Card Fees: FREE methods to pay invoices are: ACH, Wire Transfer, and via check. We reserve the right to add a percentage to invoices that are paid by credit and/or debit cards. The percentage will not exceed that of which we are charged from our processor and will be in accordance with Florida law.

Paypal fees: Effective January 1, 2022, we will impose a 2.9% fee for any payments made via Paypal.

**Upgrades/Downgrades of Service:**  
There are no refunds or credits for amounts already invoiced, setup fees, partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with any Service(s)

**GoZone Services:**  
All ordered services purchased from GoZone must be used within the time frame specified with the ordered service at the time of purchase.  Unused support services and other services are nonrefundable.

**Cancellation Process:**  
Cancellation requests must be submitted in writing via email to billing@gozonewifi.com at least 10 days prior to the next invoice due date or based upon your agreement. In the event of cancellation, customers will still have access to their applications through the end of their final billing period. If a customer has been supplied with GoZone owned hardware, all GoZone hardware must be return PRIOR to any service cancellation. Customers will be responsible for the postage to return GoZone hardware. If equipment is not returned, then the next renewable term is valid and payment is due regardless of whether the service was still used by customer.

Simply canceling the credit/debit card associated with a GoZone account does not cancel the account. GoZone will continue to treat this as an open account and the billing cycle will continue, resulting in a past due account that may be turned over to a third-party collection service. It is imperative that you speak with a GoZone representative if you wish to initiate the cancellation of your GoZone account.

Cancellation of an account does not dismiss outstanding invoices or nullify previously agreed charges, such as payments for any consulting or on-boarding fees, charged in installments or annual contract charges, portions of which may not yet have been invoiced when you canceled. At the time of cancellation, any outstanding balance must be settled. All canceled accounts with an outstanding balance may be turned over to a third-party collection service.

In the event of cancellation, GoZone will not prorate any portion of unused Service fees, and amounts due to GoZone must be paid in full.

**Billing Disputes:**  
Each GoZone customer agrees to provide GoZone 30 days to attempt settlement of any billing dispute before disputing with any third-party credit/debit card company or bank. Should GoZone receive a charge-back from a third-party credit/debit card company or bank on the customer’s behalf before GoZone has been given a chance to resolve the issue, GoZone has the right to charge the customer for its time spent in resolving such disputes and any associated fees incurred by GoZone, in addition to the $50 charge-back fee mentioned above. Regardless of the outcome of the charge-back, GoZone retains the right to collect on any Service(s) or fees that are due. GoZone may submit any disputed amounts to a third-party collection agency. Once a chargeback has been received, GoZone has the right to suspend or terminate.

**Account Adjustments:**  
Account adjustments are subject to GoZone approval.

**Refunds:**  
All service fees are non-refundable and will not be prorated at any time.

**Updates to this Policy:**  
We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “effective date” below and will post the updated Policy on this page (https://www.gozonewifi.com/policies/billing). Continuing to use our Services after we publish changes to this Billing Policy means you are consenting to these changes.

If you wish to unsubscribe from e-mail communication from GoZone WiFi, you may e-mail us at info@gozonewifi.com. Additionally, most of our email distributions contain an “unsubscribe” link. If you have questions or comments about this Billing Policy or the practices of GoZone WiFi, you may contact us at info@gozonewifi.com.
