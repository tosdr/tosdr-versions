AFFILIATE shall not negotiate or offer to negotiate any terms of the Purchase Agreement on behalf of GZ without the consent of GZ.
7. **PAYMENT TERMS.**

**7.1 Payments and Commissions**

Payments to AFFILIATE are called (“Commissions”). Once a Lead places an Order, the Lead becomes a “Client”. Completed Orders and Purchase Agreements generate an (“Invoice”) to the Client where Client pays from the Invoice. Commissions are solely based on paid Invoices. Commissions are payable only AFTER the Client has paid their first, and/or subsequent Invoice(s) pursuant to the following terms.

GZ shall pay to Affiliate the following Commissions: 10% of Product recurring subscription fee revenue received by GZ for the Initial Invoice provided that such Client has entered into a Purchase Agreement within six months following the date the initial notice for such Lead submitted by AFFILIATE. “Subscription Fee Revenue” shall mean the fees paid to GZ by referred Client for the first twelve (12) months of Prospective End Customer’s subscription to GZ’s Software Product Offerings, minus any Incidental Expenses and excluding any Add-on Sales. “Incidental Expenses” shall mean (a) costs attributable to sales, use, value-added, excise and other taxes, customs duties and other governmental charges; (b) returns or credits; (c) “Add-on Sales” shall mean additional purchases of GZ’s Product Offerings made following Prospective End Customer’s initial purchase. For avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand and agree that Subscription Fee Revenue shall not exceed the initial 12 months of fees even if the Client has selected a longer term. Commissions exclude Add-on Sales, professional services, training or consulting services, or shipping fees. GZ shall have the right to determine the amount of Affiliate Commissions and the determination will be final and Affiliate agrees with the final determination.

Commission shall be paid when requested by AFFILIATE through the Portal by GZ through check or other electronic means supported by GZ. If a due commission does not exceed $50 US, GZ reserves the right to hold payment until Commissions accumulate to the minimum amount. If a Client cancels service and a refund or credit is given, any related Commission will be deducted from the next commission payment. AFFILIATE is NOT employees of GZ and are responsible for their own local, state, or country taxes. All Commissions shall be paid in US Dollars.

**7.2 Exceptions.** No Commissions shall be paid (a) if AFFILIATE provides to GZ any incorrect or misleading information about the Lead or Order (b) for any Lead that is a then-current Client or was previously a Client of GZ or its affiliates, distributors, or partners, (c) for any Lead with whom GZ or its affiliates, distributors, or partners had substantive contact prior to AFFILIATE’s submission of a Referral or Order Form for such Lead, or (d) for the provision of any services or products other than the authorized Products.

**7.3 Payment upon Termination.** Subject to this Section 7.0, following termination of this Agreement, GZ shall pay AFFILIATE any outstanding Commissions that are due. Except as provided in this Section 7.3, GZ shall have no obligation to pay Commissions to AFFILIATE after the effective date of termination.

**7.4 Expenses.** AFFILIATE shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by it in connection with the implementation and performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to: expenses incurred in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities as provided in Section 4.0; compensation, bonuses, and benefits, if any, for its personnel; costs and expenses associated with establishing and maintaining its sales organization and offices; advertising, Product demonstration, and promotion expenses; and any and all taxes, fees, duties, tariffs, or charges which may be imposed on AFFILIATE under applicable law.

**7.6 Multiple Referrals.** In the event that two or more Affiliates or Partners of GZ, for any reason whatsoever, claim a Commission for the same Client, GZ reserves the right to award the Referral Fee to one of the representatives or to divide the Referral Fee among the representatives in such proportions as GZ shall determine to be equitable, and its decision to do so and the manner in which it does shall be final and binding on all parties involved. In no case shall the total amount of Commissions paid with regard to any such Lead exceed the maximum Commission that could be earned if only one representative were responsible for the Order.

8. **TRADEMARKS; MATERIALS.** Subject to the terms and conditions in the Agreement, GZ hereby grants, and AFFILIATE hereby accepts, a non-exclusive, non- transferable, non-sublicenseable, non-assignable, royalty-free license to use any name, logo, tagline, or other designation displayed on any display screen within the Materials (“GZ Marks”) solely for purposes of marketing the Products to potential Clients as further described herein; provided, however, that AFFILIATE shall provide GZ with samples of each use of GZ Marks prior to such use and shall refrain from all uses that GZ informs AFFILIATE are detrimental to GZ’s investment in such GZ Marks. Products and Collateral (including all components, subsequent versions, modifications, corrections, and enhancements thereof made available by GZ hereunder) are deemed “Materials” as defined in the Agreement.
9. **OWNERSHIP; PUBLICITY.**As between the parties, subject to any license expressly granted by GZ under this Agreement or an Addendum, GZ and its suppliers will retain all right, title, and interest in and to the GZ Marks, GZ Confidential Information (defined below), and the Materials, including all modifications to or derivative works of the foregoing and all intellectual property and proprietary rights incorporated into or related to the foregoing (collectively, “GZ IP”). All rights not expressly licensed by GZ under this Agreement are reserved. AFFILIATE will not directly or indirectly obtain or attempt to obtain at any time any right, title, or interest by registration or otherwise in or to the GZ Marks. AFFILIATE acknowledges that the goodwill associated with the GZ Marks belongs exclusively to GZ and, upon request, AFFILIATE will modify or cease its use of any GZ Marks. AFFILIATE will not take any action inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. To the extent that AFFILIATE obtains any ownership interest in or to any derivative work or modification to the Materials, AFFILIATE hereby assigns to GZ all right, title, and interest in and to such derivative works and/or modifications. AFFILIATE hereby grants to GZ a license to include AFFILIATE’s trademarks and service marks on that portion of GZ’s website that references its AFFILIATE. GZ is under no obligation to include or maintain the display of any such marks. GZ may issue press releases from time to time pertaining to the relationship created by the parties hereunder and/or a particular Client. All content pertaining to such press releases is subject to AFFILIATE’s review and approval, not to be unreasonably withheld.
10. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.**Any warranties regarding the Products are made only to Clients who acquire GZ Services pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Product Terms, and no such warranty is extended to AFFILIATE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES OFFERED BY GZ UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR A SPECIFIC ADDENDUM, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND THOSE THAT MAY ARISE FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.
11. **INDEMNIFICATION.**

**11.1 By AFFILIATE.** AFFILIATE will defend any action brought by Clients or other third parties based upon Claims arising from (a) AFFILIATE’s activities under this Agreement, (b) any unauthorized guarantees or warranties regarding the Materials, (c) any breach of this Agreement, or (d) AFFILIATE’s obligations under this Agreement, and AFFILIATE will pay any settlement or final award against GZ based on the foregoing Claims.

**11.2 Procedure.** The party seeking indemnity will give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Claim and provide reasonable assistance to the indemnifying party in the defense of the Claim. GZ may choose, in its sole discretion, to assume control over any litigation or settlement for any Claim involving the Products or Materials. Further, AFFILIATE will not discontinue or settle any claim in a manner that does not unconditionally release GZ without GZ’s prior written consent.

**11.3 Limitation.** Section 11.0 states AFFILIATE’s sole and exclusive remedy, and GZ’s sole and exclusive liability, for any intellectual property infringement.

12. **LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.**EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF SECTION 8.0 OR GZ’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 6.0 ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL GZ BE LIABLE TO AFFILIATE, CLIENTS, GUESTS, END USERS, OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGE TO BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST DATA), WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT AND WHETHER OR NOT GZ IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. GZ’S AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO AFFILIATE, CLIENTS, GUESTS, END USERS, AND THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, THE GREATER OF $5,000.00 OR THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY GZ TO AFFILIATE UNDER THE PARTICULAR ADDENDUM TO WHICH SUCH LIABILITY PERTAINS.
13. **CONFIDENTIALITY.**The terms of this Section 13.0 shall supersede any separate confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement between the parties.

**13.2 Protection.** The Receiving Party shall preserve the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and treat such Confidential Information with at least a reasonable standard of care.
