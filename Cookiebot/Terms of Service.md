Last update: May 2, 2024

1\. Agreement Between You and Usercentrics A/S
----------------------------------------------

1.1. The Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) govern your acquisition of services as well as all use of services on our website [www.cookiebot.com](https://www.cookiebot.com/), whether free or payable. By accepting the Terms, either by clicking a box indicating your acceptance or by executing an order form or any document referring to the Terms, you agree that the Terms form part of the agreement between you and Usercentrics A/S (“Usercentrics”) (the “**Agreement**”).

1.2. Our services are directed exclusively at Business to Business customers.

1.3. The Terms were last updated on May 2, 2024 and are effective between you and Usercentrics as of the date when you place an order or set up an account at [www.cookiebot.com](https://www.cookiebot.com/). Usercentrics reserves the right to change the Terms from time to time. If such changes are considered material, Usercentrics will inform registered customers about the changes by email, and the changes will take effect one month after such emails have been sent. Your continued use of our website or services after any changes will constitute acknowledgment and acceptance of the modified Terms.

1.4. The prevailing Terms shall always be those available on our website [www.cookiebot.com](https://www.cookiebot.com/). In the event of any discrepancies between the wording of our website or the wording of earlier Terms and these Terms, these Terms prevail.

1.5. These Terms as well as all other texts throughout the website are translated from English to other languages. These are unofficial translations and are only provided as convenience translations. They should therefore be interpreted in accordance with their English language version which will prevail in the event of any discrepancy between the English version and the translation. Usercentrics assumes no liability for any errors, omissions or ambiguities in the translations. Any person or entity choosing to rely on the translated content does so at their own risk. If in doubt, please always refer to the official English language version.

2\. The Services We Deliver – and What You Need to Do
-----------------------------------------------------

### 2.1. EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and EU’s ePrivacy Directive 2009/136/EC (“ePR”) test.

2.1.1. Usercentrics offers a free GDPR/ePR test which analyzes your website to give you an indication of whether or not your website is compliant with the rules relating to online tracking set out in the GDPR and ePR.

2.1.2. The GDPR/ePR test only encompasses some of the requirements in the GDPR and ePR and is furthermore only an analysis of up to 5 pages of your website. It is therefore not a complete analysis of your website. Therefore, a positive test response must not be taken as a guarantee that your website fulfills all requirements set out in the GDPR and ePR. 

2.1.3. If you wish to perform a complete analysis of your website, you must sign up for a Cookiebot CMP Subscription, cf. clause 2.2.

2.1.4. It is your responsibility to ensure that the domain you enter for testing is spelled correctly and is publicly available to anonymous website visitors. You warrant that you are the rightful owner of the domain, or that you otherwise have the necessary rights to have the website scanned and tested.

### 2.2. Cookiebot CMP Subscription

2.2.1. Subject to the sign-up procedure on our website where you register an account (“**Cookiebot CMP account**”), Usercentrics will deliver to you the services (“**Cookiebot CMP**”) described on our website.

2.2.2. Cookiebot Consent Management Platform (CMP) is designed as a self-serve business to business (B2B) service for website owners to facilitate compliance with EU legislation concerning the use of cookies and similar technologies (hereafter jointly referred to as “**cookies**”) on your website, to help you obtain the relevant consents to the use of cookies from the users of your website and to make it possible for the users to withdraw their consent as easy as they gave it via our [Privacy Trigger](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/widget/). Usercentrics is solely the software as a service (SaaS) provider, and it is your own responsibility to ensure correct and compliant implementation, including presenting users with compliant consent requests. The relevant EU legislation is not necessarily implemented in the same way in all EU countries, and we cannot guarantee that using Cookiebot CMP will automatically lead to compliance with all relevant rules and regulations concerning the use of cookies or the collection of consents to the use of cookies. We encourage you to seek local legal advice to ensure compliance with local legislation when implementing the solution on your website and to tailor the wording of the consent requests to be shown on your website.

2.2.3. It is your responsibility to ensure that the domains you enter on your Cookiebot CMP account are spelled correctly and are publicly available to anonymous website visitors. You warrant that you are the rightful owner of all the domains, or that you otherwise have the necessary rights to add the domains to your Cookiebot CMP account for the performance of domain scans and other services, cf. clause 3 below.

2.2.4. The results of the website scans are sent as a report to the email address you have used to sign up for your Cookiebot CMP account. Scan reports are also available on your Cookiebot CMP account. For Premium Subscriptions, it is possible to add multiple mail recipients of scan reports, cf. clause 3.1.4.1. It is your responsibility to ensure that any such additional mail recipients have given their consent to have their mail addresses added to your Cookiebot CMP account. 

2.2.5. If you have a Premium Subscription and own multiple websites, Cookiebot CMP can ask your users for consent that covers all your domains (“**Cross-domain Consent Sharing**”) on the user’s first visit to any of your websites. The functionality of the Cross-domain Consent Sharing is dependent on the user’s acceptance of third-party cookies in the web browser used to access your website.

2.2.6. It is your responsibility to ensure that the categorization and purpose descriptions of cookies identified during the website scans are in accordance with the use of those cookies on your website. If you alter categorizations or purpose descriptions of such cookies, it is your responsibility to ensure that this is done in accordance with the actual technical specifications and use of the cookies and in accordance with both relevant legislation and guidance from relevant data protection authorities. For example, if you classify cookies as “necessary” you should pay special attention to only do so for cookies that are strictly necessary to enable the basic functionality or service the user actively seeks on your website, in accordance with current legislation.

2.2.7. Our Services do not track any user´s data before they have given their consent. A user may withdraw a consent at any time by deleting cookies. If you implement Cookiebot CMP’s standard cookie declaration on your website, this contains a built-in mechanism where the user can easily and at any time withdraw or change a consent. Alternatively, you can make use of the Privacy Trigger and/or Cookiebot CMP’s “renew” method as described on [www.cookiebot.com/en/developer/](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/developer/) to develop alternative ways for your users to withdraw or change their consent. For a Freemium Subscription the Privacy Trigger is set by default.

2.2.8. A user consent is logged and documented by storing the first half of the user’s IP address number, browser user agent, website’s domain name, date and time of consent and a unique, encrypted key that is stored in a data center with Usercentrics’s cloud vendor, Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd in Dublin, Ireland. You may download a copy of the consent log from the Cookiebot CMP Manager, after which it is your own responsibility to handle the log copy data in accordance with current legislation. After 12 months, the consent is automatically deleted from our log and then used only in an aggregated, anonymized form as part of the statistics that you have access to on your Cookiebot CMP account, cf. clause 3.1.

2.2.9. If your subscription is managed by an official Cookiebot CMP reseller, the reseller will have access to collected data and configurations when managing your subscription, but the reseller has no right to share, use or sell the collected data and configurations. Collected data and configurations will not be shared with or sold to other third parties by Usercentrics.

2.3. Usercentrics acts as a data processor in accordance with the information provided in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/privacy-policy/) as described in clause 8. 

2.4. Usercentrics takes the appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, and against unauthorized disclosure, misuse or illegal processing. Usercentrics is subject to the safeguards provided for in the legislation of Denmark, where the company is established.

2.5. Usercentrics organizes its resources to provide a high level of service with at least 99.9% uptime on the operation of the cloud service and a response time of less than 1 business day for support requests related to critical bugs (high impact, high urgency) and unscheduled downtime of Cookiebot CMP. Such support requests must be submitted in writing to our helpdesk as described on [www.cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk/](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk/).

2.6. Cookiebot CMP is a self-serve service, cf. clause 2.2.2. As a customer, you can submit questions, comments or suggestions using the helpdesk as described on [www.cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk/](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk/). 

2.7. If you are dissatisfied with Cookiebot CMP or anything related to the service provided, please contact Usercentrics as described on [www.cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk/](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk/). If the case cannot be resolved, you can use the European Commission’s online complaint portal at [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/).

-------------------------

4.1. Subscriptions are billed monthly in arrears or yearly in advance and are payable by credit card, Nexi or PayPal. Payment by bank transfer can be arranged at the sole discretion of Usercentrics. You must provide us with valid and updated credit card information when signing up for Cookiebot CMP with your credit card. You authorize us to recurrently charge this credit card or bank account for all services you have accepted to buy from our website. By accepting a billing agreement using PayPal, you authorize Usercentrics as a merchant to initiate payment collection without further consent from you.

4.2. You are obliged to keep your payment details up to date. You can renew your payment authorization via the “My account” menu on our website after login to your Cookiebot CMP account.

4.3. We will draw the first month’s/year’s Subscription Fee including any applicable VAT one month after the domain(s) has/have been added to your account. If you pay by bank transfer, you must pay your invoice within 30 days of receipt.

4.4. For yearly payment in advance, any additional domains added to your Cookiebot CMP account during the yearly billing period will be billed separately to align the billing cycle for the additional domain and your other domain(s). For monthly payment in arrears, additional domains that are added during the monthly billing cycle will be billed together with the other domains at the end of the monthly billing cycle to avoid multiple payments and invoices.

4.5. Your monthly Subscription Fee can be automatically increased based on the monthly domain scan for each domain and each subdomain based on the number of pages found.

4.6. Whether the Subscription Fee is paid by bank transfer, Nexi, PayPal or credit card, invoices will be sent to the email address registered on your Cookiebot CMP account. When you log into your Cookiebot CMP account, you can view and download invoices issued to you under the “My account” menu.

4.7. You may at any time change the billing period from monthly to annual and vice versa. This can be done on your Cookiebot CMP account at [www.cookiebot.com](https://www.cookiebot.com/). The change will come into effect after the end of the current billing period.

4.9. Local VAT will be charged from customers situated in the EU, except companies that have added a VIES-valid VAT number to their Cookiebot CMP account (“reverse charge”). The exception does not apply to Danish companies. Customers outside the EU will not be charged VAT.

4.10. If you are a company situated in the EU and qualify for VAT exemption, and your VAT number is not valid according to the European Commission’s VIES VAT number validation system on the date of invoice (order and/or recurring order), or if your VIES VAT number was not added on your Cookiebot CMP account on the date of invoice, we will charge VAT, which will not be refunded.

4.11. All orders will be charged in Danish Krone (DKK), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Swiss Franc (CHF), Polish Zloty (PLN), US Dollars (USD), Norwegian Krone (NOK) or Swedish Krona (SEK) depending on your account currency setting.

You may also delete an entire domain group and all the domains in it from the “Settings” menu. You will be billed for the full current billing period, regardless of when you remove a domain or delete a domain group. When you remove a domain or delete a domain group, Cookiebot CMP and the scripts will immediately stop working for those domain(s) and it is your responsibility to remove the Cookiebot CMP scripts on your website(s) before you cancel.

Any payable balance for the removed domain(s) will be settled with the next regular invoice.

After any unpaid bills have been paid, the account will be deleted unless you are under point 1). Other than that, your account information will be retained in our Sales Cloud after canceling your Cookiebot CPM account. You can cancel your Cookiebot CMP account by logging in to our website and clicking “Cancel my account” under the “My account” menu. 

Any payable balance will be settled within 24 hours after cancellation. 

5.4. Yearly payments made in advance will not be refunded if you remove domains or cancel your Cookiebot CMP account.

By posting information or otherwise using any open communication tools as mentioned, you agree that you will not upload, post, share or otherwise distribute any content that:

i. Is illegal, threatening, defamatory, harassing, degrading, intimidating, fraudulent, deceptive, invasive, racist or contains any type of improper or inappropriate language;

ii. Infringes on any trademark, patent, trade secret, design, technical, copyright or other proprietary right of any party;

iii. Contains any type of unauthorized or unsolicited advertising; or

iv. Impersonates any person or entity, including any Usercentrics employees or representatives.

m. We have the right to remove at our sole discretion any content that we find in our judgment does not comply with these Terms along with any content that we find to be otherwise offensive, harmful, objectionable, inaccurate or in violation of any third-party copyrights or trademarks.
