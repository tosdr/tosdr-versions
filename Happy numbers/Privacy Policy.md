1\. Purpose and Scope
---------------------

This Privacy Policy addresses our approach to processing your Personal Information. Personal Information includes information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity directly or indirectly through linkages with other information.

This Privacy Policy applies to you if you interact with our websites, share your Personal Information with us voluntarily, or receive communications from us. At HappyNumbers.com, we only collect Personal Information we need to ensure that our website works smoothly and efficiently for you.

We collect your Personal Information to ensure you or your child can access, use, and quickly navigate HappyNumbers.com.

2\. Personal Information We Collect
-----------------------------------

The sources of Personal Information we collect can be generally divided into three categories:

* Personal Information you provide to us directly.
    
* Personal Information about you that we get from third parties, including public records, teachers, district or school officials.
    
* Information we collect using cookies.
    

We collect your Personal Information when you create an account on our websites, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to our website surveys, receive product updates, send us an email, or otherwise contact us.

The Personal Information we process includes a child’s first/last name, the user’s (parent’s or teacher’s) e-mail, the user’s (parent’s or teacher’s) name, the child’s grade level, school, school address (or any other preferred mailing address for communications with school and teachers), the teacher’s telephone number, username, password, data on students’ performance, and IP address.

District and school officials may provide a child’s first/last name, child’s grade level, teacher’s name, and e-mails, as well as the school, to monitor progress and identify students. Personal Information disclosed to us by districts and schools may be subject to additional regulation and protection measures set in the agreements signed with such districts and schools.

We don't claim ownership over your data and won't exploit it for unrelated marketing endeavors. Additionally, we uphold strict guidelines regarding children's data, refraining from collecting additional Personal Information from them or using your data to market products to minors.

3\. Automatic Information
-------------------------

We may automatically collect some information about you and your device when you use HappyNumbers.com, regardless of whether you created an account or just browsing our websites. In this case, Happy Numbers will collect the information through technology such as cookies. The information may include your IP address, type of web browser software, operating system type, and data about your usage (login times, buttons you click on, pages you viewed, etc.). This information is necessary for the operation of the websites, and it also helps us customize your user experience and boost the functionality and user-friendliness of HappyNumbers.com.

4\. Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
----------------------------------

Like many other websites, HappyNumbers.com uses Cookies to collect information such as your IP address, type of web browser software, operating system type, and data about your usage (login times, buttons you click on, pages you viewed, etc.). When we do so, we process your personal information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.

Cookies are small data files transferred to your computer’s hard disk to memorize information like logins and passwords. A cookie typically contains the name of the domain from which it originated, its "lifetime", and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.

We use both necessary and functionality cookies for the purposes set out below.

Necessary cookies are essential to provide website services and enable core features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these cookies, the services you have requested might not be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with essential services.

Happy Numbers may use functionality cookies to enable certain features of HappyNumbers.com, speed up and improve user interaction, and remember your choices on our websites.

Please note that you can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your web browser to reject cookies. To do so, you must access the settings menu in your browser’s menu bar and search for the term "cookies." Please note that rejecting or deleting cookies might affect certain functions of HappyNumbers.com or all functionality of the services.

Happy Numbers may also collect certain information using web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on HappyNumbers.com or in our email communications with parents, teachers, and school officials. They tell us if an email has been opened and acted upon.

If you turn off cookies on your device, we may not be able to provide specific services and support.

5\. How We Use Personal Information We Collect
----------------------------------------------

We use the Personal Information for the following purposes:

* To create and manage your account;
    
* to provide you with Services and information you requested;
    
* To respond to your requests;
    
* To personalize your experience;
    
* to provide support and improve customer service;

6\. How We Protect Personal Information
---------------------------------------

Happy Numbers Inc. maintains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that equal industry best practices, including, but not necessarily limited to, disk encryption, file encryption, firewalls, and password protection. We use encryption technology to protect data in motion and at rest from unauthorized disclosure.

**Administrative and Operational Safeguards we use to protect your Personal Information:**

**Minimizing the Use, Collection, and Retention of Personal Information:** We store the minimum information required for the proper functioning of our services. We collect minimum information from Single Sign-On (SSO) systems such as ClassLink and Clever.

**Anonymizing Information:** We use a unique tool to prepare databases for test and development environments with complete anonymization of Personal Information. Developers and QA engineers cannot access real personal data throughout the development lifecycle.

**Access Enforcement:** All employees have personal auditable accounts in all our systems. We use Single Sign-On to grant access to all internal systems. Critical applications, such as the admin panel, have role-based access control for different access levels.

**Separation of Duties:** We adhere to the principle of minimizing access, which means that, for instance, a content manager can access the BI system with de-identified student problem-solving logs, but they do not have access to the admin panel with Personal Information.

**Least Privilege:** Our internal systems use a role-based access control model to grant each employee the minimum required access level.

**Remote Access:** All communication with our servers and systems is encrypted using battle-tested protocols, such as enforced HTTPS with TLS 1.2, SSH, and OpenVPN.

**Auditable Events:** We collect all change events in our SSO system and admin panel and store them in a database without making any modifications.

**Protection of Information at Rest:** We store our backups in AWS S3 using the pgBackRest tool with AES-256-CBC encryption. Furthermore, our application servers transparently encrypt Personal Information using a symmetric cipher before storing it in an encrypted database

**Data Backup and Recovery:** We continuously back up all production PostgreSQL databases using the pgBackRest tool and retain data for 30 days, including four weekly full backups.

**Change Management:** Our infrastructure is entirely managed by Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) tools, including a custom in-house CLI tool, Terraform, and Ansible. This means that all the changes can be reviewed through standard development procedures and stored in GitHub.

**Password Guidelines**

We strive to ensure that your experience with Happy Numbers is one of utmost security and confidence. Your Personal Information is kept safe with a strong password. To ensure no one unauthorized gets into your account or accesses your Personal Information, you should choose a strong password, be careful about who has access to your computer and browser, and always remember to sign off when you are done using your account.

**What we will do in case of a data breach**

In the event that we become aware of an unauthorized disclosure or data breach:

The district, school officials, and teachers will be notified within 24 hours by email if the teacher account or any related student accounts are affected. The appropriate person in the school or school district who has purchased the valid school-wide or district-wide Happy Numbers access will be notified by phone. The notification will include the date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, a general description of what occurred, and steps we are taking to address the breach.

7\. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We value and protect your Personal Information and your child's Personal Information. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your Personal Information to unauthorized third parties. Also, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes.
