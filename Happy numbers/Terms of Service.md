3\. Prices
----------

Happy Numbers provides free and paid licenses to use Teacher accounts, as our pricing page outlines. Teacher accounts allow you to use our exercises on an interactive whiteboard for group instruction and modeling. Individual student accounts are connected to Teacher accounts and might require a paid subscription depending on whether the Teacher account needs one. If you have any questions regarding our pricing, please contact us at: [support@happynumbers.com](mailto:support@happynumbers.com).

4\. Supervising children
------------------------

Happy Numbers is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, children should be assisted by their parents, legal representatives, or teachers to access the Services by helping them set up any relevant accounts and supervising their access to the Website and the Services. Happy Numbers agrees that students’ personally identifiable information stays under the parents’ and school’s direct control.

If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant, and Happy Numbers assumes that you have the express consent of the children’s parents or legal representatives to use the Services.

Suppose a parent or a legal representative becomes aware that their represented minor has registered with us without express authorization. In that case, they should contact us using the information at the end of this page. We will delete such accounts from our files within five working days.

Happy Numbers warns persons holding parental authority, legal representatives, or teachers about the diversity and the nature of the content available on the internet, which might harm minors. So, parents, legal representatives, and teachers are encouraged to monitor children when they connect to the Website. Parents, legal representatives, and teachers shall determine what Services available on the Website minor children are allowed to use and monitor the use of the Services by the minor.

5\. Indemnity
-------------

You agree to indemnify and hold Happy Numbers and its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, licensees, officers, agents, co-branders and other partners, and employees harmless from any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable legal fees, that may arise in connection with: (i) your use of and access to the Website and Services, including without limitation any text, logo, graphic, image, video, music, or any multimedia file (the “Content”), as well as your connection to the Website; (ii) your, your children's, or third party's failure to comply with any provision of the ToS; or (iii) any claim by a third party that any other use of the Website by you or your children infringes any intellectual property, other proprietary or privacy right of such third party or has otherwise caused damage to a third party.
