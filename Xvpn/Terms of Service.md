Any modification, distribution to unauthorized parties, reverse engineering, reselling our Services, allowing other people to use your Account, or other use of the Services in a way not explicitly authorized by us is strictly prohibited under these Terms may result in the suspension of your Account.

The terms also assert that no additional rights or licenses, whether express or implied, are granted to you concerning the Services and/or Software. As between You and us, we retain all intellectual property rights (including all patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other proprietary rights) in and to the X-VPN App, all X-VPN websites and all X-VPN services and content in connection therewith.

SUBSCRIPTION POLICY
-------------------

Although users don't have to sign up to use X-VPN services, users can get more advanced services by subscribing, which means users agree to be a subscriber for the period they choose.

The Website provides a comprehensive list of available subscription plans and their pricing. We retain the right to modify or introduce new fees for subscriptions, provided reasonable notice is given through the Website. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal. Payments for subscriptions are managed by several third-party payment platforms that we partnered with. To find more information about how they process users' data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

Our Website offers multiple payment methods including one-time payment model and subscription model.

CoinPayments, Paymentwall (excluding FasterPay), and PayPal (year plan) adopt a one-time payment method, which is a one-off and non-recurring payment for a fixed period of service.

Stripe, PayPal (month plan), and FasterPay adopt a subscription model. By default, each subscription plan will automatically renew for the same term within three days before the end of the subscription period. If you wish to cancel the next-term subscription, you should do so at least three days before the end of the current subscription term. The following steps illustrate how to cancel:

* For Stripe and PayPal, Users should cancel the subscription at least three days before the end of the current billing term through the "Cancel Subscription" button on "My Account" page of the Website, or by contacting customer support on X-VPN website.
* For FasterPay, Users should cancel the subscription at least three days before the end of the current billing term by contacting customer support on X-VPN website.

It should be noted that cancelling the next-term subscription does not affect your current subscription. If you wish to request a refund for your current subscription, please refer to the next chapter "Refund Policy".

Please note that payment methods on Paymentwall may be subject to change. For each Paymentwall payment method, [Paymentwall's Terms of Service](https://www.paymentwall.com/terms) shall prevail.

**Free trials**

We offer a free trial for users in some areas. We may adjust the length and scope of the free trial at any time without prior notice to the extent permitted by law.

REFUND POLICY
-------------

1. **Purchase through Google Play or X-VPN website by PayPal, Paymentwall, or Stripe:**
    
    We offer a 30-day no-questions-asked money-back guarantee on your first subscription. You can request a refund for your first purchase for any reason within 30 days since the purchase date. However, no refunds can be made if you are found to be engaging in any breach of policy or illegal activity. Refunds beyond 30 days will be made at the discretion of X-VPN after due consideration.
    
2. **Purchase through X-VPN website by Coinpayment:**
    
    In this case, refund is not available after purchase.
    
3. **Purchase through App Store, Amazon, Galaxy Store or Huawei AppGallery:**
    
    In this case, if you would like to request a refund, please seek help from Apple, Amazon, Samsung or Huawei AppGallery who have independent refund policies and refunds are solely at their discretion.
    

Please be advised that to avoid any recurring transactions, we highly recommend submitting a refund request at least three days before the first subscription period expires. This will prevent any automatic renewals for subsequent subscription periods. It is crucial to note that if you submit a refund request after the recommended time frame, there is still a possibility of incurring subscription fees for the next period, resulting in a recurring transaction.

Refunds are generally processed within fifteen (15) working days and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase. All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency (e.g., due to foreign exchange and processing charges linked to your method of payment).
