Privacy Policy

Introduce
---------

This document (**"Privacy Policy"**) explains how X-VPN collects, uses, and shares your personal data.

X-VPN is operated by Free Connected Limited (**"we"**, **"us"**, or **"our"**), a company based in Hong Kong and established in 2017. Free Connected Limited is dedicated to creating a free and secure online environment for users worldwide.

We will not collect, process, store or transfer your data unless we have your consent. By submitting your personal data to us, and by accessing and/or using our Services, you confirm that you have read this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

X-VPN only collects the necessary data to provide enhanced VPN services. Based on this principle, we are committed:

1. X-VPN does not store your IP address or the server IP address you connect to.
2. X-VPN does not log your browsing history, data content or DNS queries.
3. X-VPN will not sell, use, or disclose any data to third parties, including government entities, for any purposes.

Data We Collect
---------------

### General Information

To enhance user experience, we may collect certain device system information and country-level location data. However, please note that we never track or collect users' IP addresses or any other sensitive information.

We may collect users' email addresses when users choose to create a X-VPN account and registration time to allow them to use a VIP account across multiple devices simultaneously. In addition, X-VPN does not always require a real email address, and users can choose to provide a fake address if desired.

When you connect to X-VPN's services, we may record connection timestamps, choice of protocol, network type, error reports, and app interactions to improve the quality of connections. These data will be kept for LESS THAN 48 HOURS and will be automatically and permanently deleted after the expiration. Furthermore, to avoid any misunderstanding, the above data will never include the user's server IP and web browsing history.

### Payment Information

We keep records of users' subscription status, payment methods, subscribed packages, subscription time, and transaction ID (or reference ID). These details are collected to provide VIP services and troubleshooting support (e.g., refunds or adding packages) to our users. However, please rest assured that we absolutely do not store any credit card or payment information itself.

### Analysis Data

To provide better VPN connection services, we offer a 24/7 Live Chat and email feedback channel. Any voluntarily sent messages via Live Chat or email will be recorded. Additionally, we may collect crash logs and data usage information for analysis purposes, solely to identify and resolve any problems users may encounter.

Third-Party Data
----------------

X-VPN offers free service on mobile and PC worldwide. To cover the cost of providing free data, we display ads on the free version. The ad platforms we utilize include [AdMob](https://policies.google.com/privacy) by Google, [InMobi](https://www.inmobi.com/privacy-policy), [Chartboost](https://support.chartboost.com/en/legal/privacy-policy), and [Liftoff](https://vungle.com/privacy). These platforms have a global presence and a reputable track record. They have also self-certified their compliance with [Google Play's Families Self-Certified Ads SDK Program requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12955712?sjid=16099780603178146474-AP).

To analyze the performance of X-VPN and identify any crashes on the mobile platform, we have integrated Firebase by Google.

On the web platform, we support user subscriptions to our VIP service. Therefore, we have integrated several popular global payment methods, including [Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full), and [Paymentwall](https://www.paymentwall.com/privacypolicy). In addition, to ensure the privacy and security of our users, we also offer an encrypted cryptocurrency payment option that cannot be traced back to the source of the payment being made - [CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net/help-privacy).
