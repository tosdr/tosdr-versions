Limitation of Liability and Exclusion of Damages
------------------------------------------------

1. Unless caused by our gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct, we limit our total liability to you for any claims arising from these terms or your access to the Website solely to your incidental and direct damages, if any. However, our total liability to you will not exceed the lesser of $250 USD or the total amount you paid us during the 12-month period before you made your claim. Recovery of these damages will be your sole and exclusive remedy. We disclaim any liability for any other damages of any kind arising out of these terms or your access to the Website.
2. Unless caused by the other’s gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct, neither party will be liable to the other party for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages arising out of these terms or the Website. This exclusion applies even if the other party knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
3. The mutual exclusion of special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages is independent of your exclusive remedy and survives even if your exclusive remedy fails of its essential purpose or a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction otherwise deems your exclusive remedy unenforceable.
4. The limitations and exclusions in this section apply regardless of the theory of liability asserted, whether strict liability, breach of warranty (express or implied), breach of contract, tort, or any other legal theory.

Scope of Disclaimers
--------------------

The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations contained in sections 13, 14, and 15 apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, but no more. They are not intended to deprive you of any mandatory protections provided to you under applicable law. Because some jurisdictions may prohibit the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties, liability for consequential damages, or other matters, some or all of the disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to you. It is your responsibility to determine the extent of which sections 13, 14, and 15 may be applied to you. Please note that nothing in this Agreement is intended to benefit any particular third party, and only the parties hereto shall have standing to enforce any term of this Agreement.

Loss Payment (also known as Indemnification)
--------------------------------------------

1. **In General.** You must pay us for any loss of ours that you caused by your negligence, intentional misconduct, or violation of these terms. But you need not pay us for a loss caused by our gross negligence or intentional misconduct.
2. **Definitions**
    1. Loss means a monetary amount that we are legally responsible for or pay in any form. Amounts include, for example, a judgment, a settlement, a fine, damages, injunctive relief, staff compensation, a decrease in property value, and expenses for defending against a claim for a loss (including fees for legal counsel, expert witnesses, and other advisers). A loss can arise from a tangible or intangible detriment; from bodily injury, property damage, or other causes; can be based on tort, breach of contract, or any other theory or recovery; and includes incidental, direct, and consequential damages.
    2. A loss is caused by an event if the loss would not have occurred without the event, even if the event is not a proximate cause of the loss.
3. **Legal Defense of a Claim.** We have control over defending a claim for a loss (including settling it), unless we direct you to control the defense. We reserve the right to select legal counsel of our choice, for any claims subject to indemnification. You and we must cooperate with each other in good faith on a claim.
4. **No Exclusivity.** Our rights under this section do not affect other rights we might have.

Limited Time to Bring Claims
----------------------------

A party to these terms must bring any claim that party may have against the other party that arises out of these terms or the Website within 1 year after the claim arises. If a party fails to bring any claim that party may have against the other party within this 1-year period, the claim is permanently barred.

Compliance with Laws
--------------------

You understand that we make no representation that the content available on this Website is appropriate or available for use in any particular locations. You assume all knowledge of applicable law and are responsible for compliance with these laws.

Governing Law
-------------

Florida law exclusively governs these terms without regard for any choice-of-law rules that might direct the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The predominant purpose of these terms is providing services and licensing access to intellectual property and not a “sale of goods.”

Place for Resolving Disputes
----------------------------

1. Except for disputes subject to arbitration, all disputes arising under these terms or regarding the Website will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in the State of Florida, United States of America. The parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in Palm Beach County, Florida to resolve all disputes not subject to arbitration. The parties agree that the exclusive venue and forum to resolve all disputes not subject to arbitration will be in the courts in Palm Beach County, Florida, and waive any right to seek another venue because of improper or inconvenient forum.
2. The parties agree that the Website will be deemed to be based in the State of Florida, United States of America, and that the Website will be further deemed a passive online service provider that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over the Website, either specific or general, in any other jurisdiction.

Dispute Resolution; Exception for Small Claims
----------------------------------------------

1. **In General.** Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met the obligations under these terms. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to these terms.
2. **Litigation Election.** Either party may elect to litigate, as permitted within the terms of this Agreement, the following type of case or controversy: (a) an action seeking equitable relief; (b) any claim that meets the jurisdictional requirements for small claims court; or (c) a suit to compel compliance with this dispute resolution process. The Website may elect to litigate billing or payment disputes or collection matters.
3. **Mediation.** The parties may optionally seek to compel each other to engage in non-binding mediation as a first alternative to arbitration or litigation. In such case, each party will bear their own costs in mediation and the parties will share equally between them all third-party mediation costs unless the parties otherwise agree in a writing signed by the party agreeing to bear the costs. The mediation will occur in Palm Beach County, Florida, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
4. **Arbitration.** Within 30 days after the conclusion of any optional mediation, the parties will submit all unresolved disputes arising out of these terms—including any dispute about the existence, validity, or termination of these terms—to binding arbitration by a single arbitrator with a professional arbitration service acceptable to the parties. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitration service, the arbitration will take place under the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures. The parties will bear equally the costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator; each party will bear the costs associated with its case. The arbitration will take place in Florida. The arbitration will be confidential. This section and the arbitrator’s authority to grant relief are subject to (1) the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16, et seq.; (2) the provisions of this agreement; and (3) the American Arbitration Association Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes. The arbitrator may not award punitive or exemplary damages, or damages otherwise limited or excluded in this agreement, and the arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding. Any court of competent jurisdiction may confirm and enforce the arbitrator’s award. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern any post-award proceedings.
5. _**Waiver of Jury Trial.**_ Both parties agree that as part of their consideration for these terms, they waive the right to a trial by jury for any dispute arising between the parties related to the subject matter of these terms. The parties further agree that this waiver will be enforceable up to and including the day that trial is to start, and even if the arbitration provisions of this section are waived.

Class Action Waiver
-------------------

Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the advanced written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

Rights to Injunctive Relief
---------------------------

Both parties acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to provide an aggrieved party with full compensation if the other party violates these terms, and that an aggrieved party may seek injunctive relief if a violation occurs, in addition to seeking all other remedies available at law or in equity.
