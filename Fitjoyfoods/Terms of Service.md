Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITES, ANY WEBSITES LINKED FROM THE SITES, ANY CONTENT ON THE SITES OR OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Company’s liability to you for any cause whatsoever, and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the lesser of: (a) the amount paid, if any, by you to Company for the products or service on THE Sites; or (b) one hundred dollars ($100). Certain state laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.

Indemnification

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username(s), password(s), and your account(s), as well as all activities that occur under your account(s). You hereby agree to indemnify, and hold Company, its affiliates, our licensors, licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and each of the foregoing entities’ respective resellers, distributors, service providers and suppliers, and all of the foregoing entities’ respective officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, representatives and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities and costs (including settlement costs and any legal or other fees and expenses for investigating or defending any actions or threatened actions) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach of the Policies or representations and warranties by you or arising from your account(s). You shall use your best efforts to cooperate with us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right of reasonable approval over the choice of counsel to defend the Indemnified Parties, which such cost and expense shall be borne by you.

Dispute Resolution

Mindful of the high cost of litigation, you agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: In the event of any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted on or use of the Sites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of the Policies or any part of it (a “Dispute”), the party asserting the Dispute shall prior to commencing any action, first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 15 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice to you shall be sent to your last known billing address and/or the address in your online profile. Notices to Company shall be sent to FitJoy Nutrition, LLC, 500 San Marcos St. Suite 200 Austin, Tx 78702 attn: Legal Department. You agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent, which must be satisfied prior to initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party. Subject to the foregoing, you agree that in the event a Dispute is not resolved as set forth above, any and all claims and disputes within the scope of the Policies or related to the Sites must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class action basis. Accordingly, claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. Such binding arbitration is to take place in the State, City and County of New York in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). The arbitrator’s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and us alone. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual or entity under applicable law, the AAA rules, and the Policies. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company. Under no circumstances will you be permitted to obtain awards for, and each user hereby waives all rights to claim punitive, incidental, or consequential damages, any other damages other than actual out-of-pocket expenses, and any and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Terms of Use, or the rights and obligations of users and us in connection with the Policies, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. If any of these terms of use are found unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be considered severable from the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

Limitation on Time to File Claim

No waiver of any provision of these terms of use by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and Company’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE, OR THE SITES MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE PERMANENTLY BARRED.

Transparency in Supply Chain Disclosure

The state of California requires the following disclosure statement as of January 1, 2012, pursuant to the “Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010”.

All of the dietary and nutritional supplements marketed by Company and many of the ingredients used in those products, are manufactured in the U.S., in accordance with applicable U.S. labor laws. While some of the ingredients used in our dietary and nutritional supplements are sourced from foreign countries, Company’s finished products are manufactured in the U.S. in compliance with the current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) for dietary supplements.

Company’s products are marketed across the U.S. and throughout the world. Company is committed to marketing only safe and effective dietary and nutritional supplements, and to conducting business in compliance with applicable law. Company exhibits and promotes the highest standards of honest and ethical conduct in our dealings and we hold our manufacturers, suppliers, retailers and distributors to the same standard. Each of Company’s manufacturers and suppliers are carefully selected based on their reputation and evaluation by Company, prior to entering into a business relationship. In addition, Company conducts in-person inspections and audits of our manufacturers and suppliers to ensure they are operating in compliance with the cGMPs. The terms of our agreements with manufacturers require that they shall not use child labor in the manufacturing, packaging or distribution of products; they shall provide their employees with a safe and healthy workplace in compliance with all applicable laws; they shall only employ persons whose presence is voluntary; they shall not use prison labor or use corporal punishment or other forms of mental or physical coercion as a form of discipline of employees; they shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations including without limitation, applicable wage, hour, labor and environmental laws including but not limited to minimum wage, overtime and maximum hours; and they shall agree to utilize fair employment practices as defined by applicable laws. Further, foreign distributors of Company products are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and obtain all appropriate government approvals, certificates, licenses and permits pertaining to the import, sale, and advertising of Company products in the applicable authorized territory.

Company is not aware of any slavery, human trafficking or other abhorrent and illegal labor practices in connection with any ingredient manufactured or supplied to us by foreign vendors. Company is committed to the effort to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from the supply chain and improve transparency. In furtherance of that effort, if we identify an ingredient manufacturer or supplier who does not meet the aforementioned standards, we will demand corrective action and/or discontinue any business relationship with them. Additionally, Company provides its employees and management with training on slavery, human trafficking and other abhorrent and illegal labor practices.

Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act - New Jersey Residents

The following provision applies to residents of the State of New Jersey. Pursuant to the New Jersey Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice ACT (“TCCWNA”), N.J.S.A. 56:12-14 et seq., certain businesses are not permitted to offer or enter into written consumer contracts with consumers or prospective consumers which include any provision that violates any clearly established legal right of a consumer, or responsibility of the business, as established by State or Federal law. The Terms of Use are intended to comply with TCCWNA. In the event of a conflict between the Terms of Use and the TCCWNA, the terms of the TCCWNA take precedence and will control.

The TCCWNA also requires businesses to specify which provisions are void, unenforceable, or inapplicable in the State of New Jersey. The following provisions of the Terms of Use shall not be applicable to New Jersey residents: (i) provisions which limit the Company’s liability for any tortious action or breach of contract by the Company; (ii) provisions which limit the amount of damages which may be sought for any tortious action or breach of contract by Company; and (iii) provisions which limit the time within which claims against the Company must be brought.
