**6\. E-Commerce and Transactions on our Platform**  
MediaNews Group may allow you to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product or service such as a newspaper subscription, a print or online advertisement, a print of a photograph, a photograph product or other tangible goods and services. To serve you most efficiently, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third party. These third parties may have separate privacy and data collection practices, so please be sure to read those as well. We and our payment processors implement reasonable security measures; however, you should be aware that no transmission over the internet is 100% secure. If you’re concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be provided so that you can call to place your order by phone. MediaNews Group cannot and does not take responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties. You agree to release MediaNews Group and its affiliates from any damages that you incur, and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your purchase of any products or services made available by third parties through MediaNews Group.

**7\. Third Party Sites and Services**  
**7.1 Links to Third Party Sites.** Links to or from other Internet sites (each, a “**Third Party Site**”) may be included at times as a convenience to you. These sites have not necessarily been reviewed by MediaNews Group and are maintained by third parties over which MediaNews Group exercises no control. Please note that these links do not imply an endorsement of any third party, web site, or products or services provided by any third party, and MediaNews Group takes no responsibility for the Third Party Sites or the quality, accuracy, availability, content, policies, or privacy practices of the Third Party Sites. You should carefully read the applicable terms and conditions and privacy policy of any Third Party Site before engaging in any transactions or submitting any personal information to the Third Party Site.

**7.2 Access to Third Party Services.** The Platform may also integrate, incorporate, advertise, or grant access to products or services maintained by third parties over which MediaNews Group exercises no control (“**Third Party Services**”). Third Party Services are also subject to any other agreement you may agree to before being given access to the Third Party Services (each, a “**Third Party Service Agreement**”). The terms of any Third Party Service Agreement (which may include payment of additional fees) will apply to the applicable Third Party Services provided under that Third Party Service Agreement, but will not apply to any other Services you may access through MediaNews Group. Accordingly, MediaNews Group expressly disclaims any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, availability, reliability, or transactions of any Third Party Services or the policies, practices, or security measures of those Third Party Services. Incorporation of or linking to any Third Party Services, or advertising any Third Party Services, does not imply an endorsement or guarantee of such Third Party Service, and MediaNews Group takes no responsibility for them.

**8\. App Store**  
The Application may be obtained through a third party distribution platform (e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play App Store) (the “**App Store**”) and is to be used solely on a mobile device owned or controlled by you that operates such third party’s operating system. These Terms of Use incorporate by reference the terms available at the respective App Store from which you have obtained the Application. You agree that these Terms of Use are between you and MediaNews Group and not with the App Store. The App Store is not responsible for the Application, maintenance and support services or any warranty thereof, or addressing any claims related thereto. You agree to pay all fees charged by the App Store in connection with the Application (if any). The Application may also be subject to additional terms and conditions and privacy policies, and MediaNews Group is not a party to nor responsible for those additional terms.

**9\. Representations and Warranties**  
You hereby represent and warrant to MediaNews Group and our affiliates that: (a) you have the legal right and authority to enter into these Terms of Use; and (b) these Terms of Use form a binding legal contract.

You acknowledge that the Platform is a general purpose online service and is not specifically designed to facilitate compliance with any specific law. You represent and warrant to MediaNews Group that your use of and access to the Platform, including any Content or Services, will comply with all applicable laws, rules, or regulations (“**Laws**”) and will not cause MediaNews Group, our affiliates, or any other third party to violate any applicable Laws. MediaNews Group is not responsible for notifying you of any such Laws, enabling your compliance with any such Laws, or for your failure to comply.

**10\. Indemnification**  
You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MediaNews Group and its officers, directors, shareholders, affiliates, employees, agents, service providers, contractors, assigns, users, customers, providers, licensees, and successors in interest (“**Indemnified Parties**”) from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, fees, expenses, and costs (including attorneys’ fees, court costs, damage awards, and settlement amounts) that result from any claim or allegation (“**Claim**”) against any Indemnified Party arising in any manner from: (a) your access to or use of the Platform or any Content; (b) your use and disclosure of any Content or Services; (c) your violation of any applicable Laws; (d) your User-Generated Content; or (e) your breach of any representation, warranty, or other provision of these Terms of Use. MediaNews Group will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of any such claim or allegation, and MediaNews Group will have the right to participate in the defense of any such claim at its expense.

**11\. General Disclaimer**

MOREOVER, MEDIANEWS GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN THE PLATFORM OR KEEP IT OPERATIONAL. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO THESE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN WHOLE OR IN PART. YOU ASSUME THE SOLE RISK OF MAKING USE OF THE PLATFORM AND THE CONTENT IT PROVIDES.

NO CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM IS INTENDED AS OR CONSTITUTES PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OF ANY KIND.

YOU EXPRESSLY ASSUME ALL RISK FOR SUCH USE.

**12\. Limitation of Liability**  
IN NO EVENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL MEDIANEWS GROUP ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING ALL PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES RELATED TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, THE CONTENT OR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE CONTENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR THOSE THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, ANY MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THIRD PARTY MATERIALS, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MEDIANEWS GROUP AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR: (1) ANY USER-GENERATED CONTENT OR ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT, OR OTHER ACTION OR INACTION OF ANY USER OR THIRD PARTY, (2) YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM OR CONTENT, OR ANY TECHNICAL MALFUNCTIONS OF THE PLATFORM, (3) MODIFICATION OR REMOVAL OF ALL OR PART OF THE PLATFORM OR CONTENT, (4) DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN THE CONTENT, (5) ANY SECURITY INCIDENT OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR INTRUSION INTO YOUR DATA OR TRANSMISSIONS, (6) LOSS OF ALTERATION OF DATA, OR (7) ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, MOBILE DEVICE, OR OTHER PROPERTY, WHETHER CAUSED BY VIRUS, BUGS, MALWARE, OR OTHER HARMFUL SOFTWARE OR CODE OR OTHER CAUSE.

MEDIANEWS GROUP’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS OF USE AND ALL CONTENT AND SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF USE OR THROUGH THE PLATFORM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED $10. YOU AGREE THAT MEDIANEWS GROUP WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THESE TERMS OF USE WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS LIABILITY. IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES IS NOT PERMITTED, MEDIANEWS GROUP’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

**13\. Use of Company Directories**  
The contact information contained in the Platform, including but not limited to contact details available on the “Contact Us” or similar pages of the Platform or information about our reporters, photographers, employees, or independent contractors available through the Platform is provided for informational or business lookup purposes only and is not to be used for marketing or telemarketing applications. This information may not be copied or redistributed and is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. In no event will MediaNews Group or its suppliers be liable in any way with regard to such information.

**14\. Mandatory Arbitration; Class Action Waiver; Governing Law**  
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED BELOW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR WE MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND NOT IN COURT OR AS PART OF ANY CLASS ACTION. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

The terms of this Section 14 apply to all Disputes, as defined below, even if the acts, omissions, or relationships giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, if you or we initiated an arbitration or lawsuit prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification), that arbitration or lawsuit will continue to be governed by the version of the Terms applicable when the arbitration or lawsuit was initiated.

If any provision in this Section 14 is deemed to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be severed, with the rest of Section 14 of these Terms of Use remaining in full force and effect. Each provision of this Section 14 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law whether or not so expressly stated. 

**14.1.  Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**. You and we agree that this agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) applies.

You and we agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration under the provisions in this Section 14.1. A “**Dispute**” means any dispute, claim or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and us that in any way arises out of, relates to or is connected with your subscription, your account, your use or attempted use of our website, your use or attempted use of our services, all marketing from us, these Terms of Use, the Subscription Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any other agreement between you and us, including any disputes over the validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate. A Dispute shall be subject to these Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.

You and we understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award may be limited.

i.        Informal Negotiation Period. Our customer support department is available to address any concerns you may have. If you have a complaint about your subscription, please reach out to customer support as described in the [Subscription Terms](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/subscriber-terms-and-conditions/). If you have a complaint related to your use of the Platform, contact us at termsofuse@medianewsgroup.com. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers’ satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and we agree to first attempt to negotiate the Dispute informally (“**Informal Negotiation**”) for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any lawsuit or arbitration (“**Initial Dispute Resolution Period**”). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If we have a Dispute with you, we will send notice of that Dispute to your email or residential address you have provided to us. If you have a Dispute with us, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: attorney@medianewsgroup.com using the subject line “Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.” Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, the email address associated with your subscription or account, and your residential address. The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 30 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If you or we are represented by counsel, you and we will participate in the consultation and good faith negotiations along with your or our respective counsel. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously complied with these Informal Negotiation requirements, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend or dismiss the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies. You and we authorize the arbitration provider (or the arbitrator) to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Informal Negotiation requirements. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Negotiation process required by this paragraph.

ii.       Binding Arbitration. If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve the Dispute unless an exception applies as stated below.

Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“**AAA Rules**”) effective as of the date of the notice of Dispute, as modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available on AAA’s website, www.adr.org, or by calling AAA toll free at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and us, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of these Terms of Use is not enforceable.

If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and we agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.

iii.      Class and Collective Action Waiver. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, including but not limited to requests for public injunctive relief.

iv.      Claims Exempt from Arbitration. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, piracy, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation (“**Excluded IP Claims**”). Excluded IP Claims also are exempt from the Informal Negotiation provisions in Section 14.1(i) above.

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party also may seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, then before the arbitrator is formally appointed, either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.

v.       Exception – Mass Arbitration Before NAM. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by AAA, if 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by AAA Rules or administered by AAA. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (“**NAM**”), a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed as modified by these Terms of Use, including the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, but excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “**NAM Rules**”). The NAM Rules are available at http://www.namadr.com or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM rather than AAA, you or we may seek an order from AAA compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. If for any reason the provisions in this Section 14.1(v) are found to be unenforceable, or if for any reason NAM declines to administer the Mass Arbitration, then the Disputes comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be administered by AAA.

vi.      30 Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions in this Section 14.1 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following email address: [attorney@medianewsgroup.com](mailto:attorney@medianewsgroup.com) using the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.” The notice must be sent within 30 days of the date on which you purchase your subscription or create your account (or if you already had a subscription or account at the time this version of the Terms became effective, then within 30 days following the Effective Date); otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 14.1. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. Opting out of arbitration will not affect in any way the benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled.

vii.     Fees and Costs. Payment of arbitration fees shall be determined by the neutral arbitration provider’s rules, as modified by this agreement. We will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees that are more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law. You will not be required to pay any amounts incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous, in bad faith, or brought for harassment or an improper purpose, in which case the arbitrator may award us our attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, arbitration fees and/or costs.

viii.    Survival. The Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions in Section 14.1 shall survive termination of these Terms of Use and your use of our services.
