Any assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. MediaNews Group may assign the Terms of Use to any party that assumes MediaNews Group’s obligations hereunder. The parties hereto are independent parties, not agents, employees or employers of the other or joint ventures, and neither acquires hereunder any right or ability to bind or enter into any obligation on behalf of the other. Any reference herein to “including” will mean “including, without limitation.”
