------------------------------------------------------

“Cookies” are small data files that are sent to, and stored by, your web browser software on your computer hard drive, tablet, mobile device, or other device.

We may use the following types of Cookies on our Applications, Websites, Platform, and Services:

**Strictly Necessary (i.e., “Essential”) Cookies**

These Cookies are necessary for our Applications, Websites, and Platform to function.  They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request to receive our access our Services via our Applications, Websites, or Platform, such as, logging in to your account on one of our Websites to access the Services, setting your privacy preferences, or signing up to our free email newsletter services. You can set your browser to block or reject these Cookies, but some parts of our Applications, Websites, or Platform may then not work.  You may also configure your privacy preferences via the Cookie preferences menu on our websites to block/reject these “Essential” Cookies, but similarly some parts of our Websites may then not work. 

**Performance (i.e., “Analytics”) Cookies**

These Cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our Applications, Websites, and Platform. They help us to know which pages and content are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around our Applications, Websites, and Platform.  If you do not allow these Cookies we will not know when you have visited our Applications, Websites, and Platform and will not be able to monitor performance on them.

We use Google Analytics – a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc – on our Services, Applications, Websites, and Platform. Google Analytics uses Cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with our Services, Applications, Websites, and Platform; compile reports on their activity; and provide other Services related to their activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information about you (including your Personal Information), such as, your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor, and any referring website. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt-out of tracking of analytics by Google, click [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). 

**Functional (i.e., “Personalization”) Cookies**

These Cookies enable our Applications, Websites, and Platform to provide enhanced functionality and personalization when you access our Services via the Internet. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our our Applications, Websites, and Platform. If you do not allow these Cookies, then some or all of these Services may not function properly.

**Targeting (i.e., “Marketing”) Cookies**

These Cookies may be set through our Applications, Websites, and Platform by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other websites. If you do not allow these Cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.  For additional information about our use of third-party service providers and our interest-based adverting practices on our Services, please refer to the following Sections of our Privacy Policy: [Section 6 (How Do We Use Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising),](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy#section-6) [Section 7 (How Do Third Parties Collect & Use Your Information Through Our Services)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy#section-7), [Section 8 (What Are Your Privacy Rights & Choices)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy#section-8), and [Section 14 (What About Linked Third-Party Services, Sites, & Advertisements That I See Via The Services?)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy#section-14).

**Social Media Cookies**

These Cookies are set by a range of social media services (such as Facebook) that we have added to the Websites, Applications, and Platform to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across our Websites, Applications, Platform, and other websites. They are also capable of building a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these Cookies, you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.

**Other Similar Technologies**

We along with our third-party service providers may also use other Internet technologies that are similar to Cookies on our Applications, Websites, Platform and Services.  These other similar technologies may include, but are not necessarily limited to: such as Flash technologies and Flash Cookies (as is discussed in greater detail below), web beacons or pixel tags, or other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with Cookies and track your use of the Services, as well as serve you ads and personalize/customize your experience when you are using our Services and/or when you are on other websites when those Cookies can be accessed. We also may include Web beacons in email messages, newsletters, and other electronic communications that we send to you as part of or through the Services to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics, personalization, and advertising. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

**\[Flash Cookies\]**

We may also use Flash cookies. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the [Adobe website](http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html) and make changes at the [Global Privacy Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html). Please note that limiting third-party cookies through your browser controls will not necessarily opt you out of first- or third-party interest-based advertising, as some technologies (including those we or our partners may use) may not respond to these browser controls.
