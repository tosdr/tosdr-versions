### **3.2.1 Device/Usage Information.**

We may automatically collect certain Personal Information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Services.

As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools and technologies, to assist in collecting and analyzing this information and Personal Information about you.

We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results. In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique MNG identifier for our internal use, in which case your MNG identifier will be considered aggregated and de-identified information owned by MNG, our use of which is governed by this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.

### **3.2.2. Location Information.**

Some of our Applications may have the ability to provide content to you based on your GPS location, if you enable this feature. Your GPS location is your exact location. You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the Application.  You can edit that setting on your device at any time. If you enable these features, your GPS location will be found by satellite, cellphone tower, or Wi-Fi and used by the Application. If you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider’s servers.

If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific Application does not have location-based features, we do not collect your precise GPS location.  However, we do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location.  Ads on our Websites and Applications may be targeted based on this approximate location, but are not targeted based on your GPS location.

We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, ZIP code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. For example, if your IP address indicates an origin in a specific US State and city or region, the Services may be customized with information and advertisements relevant to that specific US State, city, or region.

### **3.2.3. Cookies & Other Information Technologies.**

“Cookies” are small data files that are sent to, and stored by, your web browser software on your computer hard drive, tablet, mobile device, or other device. When you use or access the Services via the Internet, we and our third-party partners may use cookies and similar internet tracking technologies to do things, such as: (a) store your username and password to your accounts for the Services; (b) monitor and analyze the usage of our Applications, Websites, Platform, and/or Services by collecting the information discussed in Section 3.2 of this Privacy Policy; (c) customize the Services to your explicit and inferred preferences; and (d) deliver interest-based advertising displayed by the Applications, Websites, Platform, and Services, as well as advertisements that may be displayed on other websites or mobile applications. Please review our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/) to learn about our use – and our third-party service providers’ use – of cookies and similar Internet technologies on our Applications, Websites, Platform, and Services. 

**Additional Notes About Cookies & Your Rights & Choices:**

* Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, cookies may constitute your Personal Information under applicable laws.
* For additional information about how we, and our third-party advertising partners, may use your cookies when you access the Services via the Internet, please refer to the following sections of our Privacy Policy: [Section 6 (How Do We Use Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising?)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-6) and [Section 7 (How Do Third Parties Collect & Use Your Personal Information Via The Services?)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-7).
* For additional information about your legal rights and choices regarding our and our third-party advertising partners’ collection and use of your cookies when you use the Services – including how you can opt-out or block the collection and use of your cookies by us and third parties –  please refer to [Section 8 (What Are Your Rights & Choices?)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-8), [Section 9 (Additional Privacy Rights and Choices of U.S. Residents)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-9), and [Section 10 (Use of The Services By Users From Outside The United States)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-10).
* We may sometimes target ads to you through ‘onboarded’ audiences: to do this, we may share information you have provided to us with service providers, who will de-identify the information and associate it with cookies that enable us to reach you with display media. We may also help these service providers place their own cookies, by deploying a cookie that is associated with a ‘hashed’ value associated with interest-based or demographic data, to permit advertising to be directed to you on other websites, applications, or services.
* We also may use cookies to collect information around and about abandoned shopping carts for purchases made by you on our services.  A shopping cart is considered to be abandoned within one hour of inactivity/lack of purchase.  For certain services and users, once a cart is considered abandoned, an SMS message will be sent as a reminder.

### **3.2.4. Personal Information About You That We Collect from Other Sources**

i. _Social Media Networks & Other Third-Party Services_

In this Privacy Policy, “**Social Media**” includes Facebook, and “**Third-Party Services**” include Google and Apple.

iii. _Schools and Workplaces_.

If your school or employer purchases a subscription to the Services that allows everyone within your organization, or certain people within your organization, to use the Services, your school or employer may provide us with your Personal Information to grant you access to the Services as a user (e.g., your name, work or school email address, and username). 

iv. _Information from Other Third Parties_.

We may obtain additional Personal Information about you from other third parties, such as partners, researchers, data services companies (e.g., for data enhancement), and others.

### **3.2.5. Collection of Personal Information Across Devices & Applications.**

Sometimes, we (or our service providers) may use the Personal Information we collect about you – for instance, log-in credentials, IP addresses, hashed email addresses, and unique mobile device identifiers – to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content, features, and advertising, and provide you with a seamless experience across the devices you use to access the Services.

**5\. With Whom Do We Share Your Information?**

We may share or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to our service providers, (a) in order to provide you with the Services or products that you have requested from us, (b) when we have your permission, or (c) as is otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  We work with service providers to provide certain services and perform certain functions on our behalf, such as:

When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by those advertisers’, operators’, or sponsors’ privacy policies or practices.

We may share your information with non-affiliated third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship, including without limitation our event sponsors, if you attend an event, third-party advertisers, and advertising and list brokering networks, for their own and sometimes our own advertising and marketing purposes. Those third parties may combine Personal Information they receive from us with other information about you that they obtained from other sources or directly from you.

As described in this Privacy Policy, we may collect and share information about materials you accessed on the Platform, including but not limited to searches you conducted and articles and videos you requested and/or viewed. We may share this information with third parties, including our service providers, advertising networks, and business partners.

In some situations, you may be able to limit disclosure of this information to third parties as described in this Policy.

We may access, disclose, transfer, and preserve your information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:

* Protect our users and our legal rights, privacy, or safety and that of our subsidiaries, Affiliates, employees, agents, contractors, or other individuals, including by enforcing this Privacy Policy, our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/), or our [Terms of Use](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/terms-of-use/);

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may disclose any aggregated and/or de-identified information derived from the Personal Information that we collect about you to any third party for any purpose we deem necessary or appropriate.

**6\. How Do We Use Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising?**
====================================================================

**6.1. Our Use of Online Analytics.**
-------------------------------------

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those provided by Google Analytics, Adobe Omniture, The Trade Desk, and similar providers.  These service providers use the sort of technology described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/) and [Section 3.2.3](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-3-2-3) of this Privacy Policy  to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by these technologies will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in [Section 6.2](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-6.2) and [Section 8.1](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-8.1) of this Privacy Policy and in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/). You can opt-out of Google Analytics as described in Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy.

**6.2. Our Use of Interest-Based Advertising.**
-----------------------------------------------

When you use the Services, we may serve you with ads based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, Personal Information and other information that you provide, such as, your age or gender, your searches, demographic and geographic data, User-Generated Content, and other information that you provide to us. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be based on your interests.

When you use the Services, we may share information about you, such as a hashed version of your email address, your IP address, and information about your device settings with our third-party advertising technology providers.  Those advertising technology providers may use that information to assign you a unique ID for the purpose of recognizing you on your devices. We may place this unique ID in our first-party cookie, or use a partner that places a third-party cookie and allows it to be used for online and interest-based ad targeting. Your unique ID may be shared by us or on our behalf with third-party advertisers for interest-based ad targeting.

Also, third parties, including without limitation those whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may place cookies, web beacons or pixel tags, or other similar tracking technologies (such as mobile ‘SDKs,’ which function like a mobile version of a browser cookie and are embedded in mobile applications) on your computer browser, mobile phone applications, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, including your Personal Information, in order to: (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and mobile applications; and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Websites, Applications, Platform, and the use of our Services. We also allow other third parties to serve interest-based ads to you via the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services so that interest-based ads may be delivered to you when you are using other websites and mobile applications. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, your IP address, and/or information about your browser or operating system, which may be identified by a service provider for purposes of delivering interest-based advertising on the Services, other websites, and/or mobile applications. We likewise may work with platform providers who serve advertising across devices. For instance, we may want to reach our web-based customers when they are on their mobile devices. This is done, generally, by correlating common attributes (such as IP addresses, other browser or device information, hashed email addresses, or unique ID) across devices, to infer a common identity across multiple channels.

Where a third party advertiser assigns you a unique ID, we may place this unique ID in our first party cookie, or use a partner that places a third party cookie and allows it to be used for online and interest based ad targeting. Your unique ID may be shared by us or on our behalf with third party advertisers for interest based ad targeting.

The third parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting, as is described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/) and in Section 8 (What are Your Rights & Choices?) [\[LN1\]](#_msocom_1) of this Privacy Policy. We do not maintain or control these opt-opt mechanisms, which are provided by non-affiliated third parties. Further, we do not control which third parties choose to participate in these opt-out mechanisms. Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Services, but these ads may be less relevant to your interests.

You can opt-out of targeted or cross-contextual advertising, as those terms are defined in applicable privacy laws, by visiting our [Do Not Sell/Share My Information page](https://my.datasubject.com/16A1AnRt2Fn8i1unj/77). For additional information about your legal rights regarding our collection and sharing, selling, or other disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties, please refer to the following Sections of this Privacy Policy: [Section 8 (What Are Your Rights & Choices?)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-8), [Section 9 (Additional Privacy Rights and Choices of U.S. Residents)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-9), and [Section 10 (Use of The Services By Users From Outside The United States)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-10)[\[LN2\]](#_msocom_2) [\[LN3\]](#_msocom_3) [\[LN4\]](#_msocom_4) .[\[LN5\]](#_msocom_5) 

**7\. How Do Third Parties Collect & Use Your Information Through Our Services?**
=================================================================================

As is described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, for certain advertising, analytics, and other features that appear in the Services or that we provide via the Services, a third party, such as an advertiser, search engine, or other partner may collect your Personal Information, such as, your name, mailing address, device information, IP address, etc., in accordance with applicable laws.  Subject to applicable laws, these third-party entities may use your Personal Information in any way they choose, including to market to you or to share your Personal Information with others. Subject to applicable laws, in those instances, your Personal Information may be covered by those third-party entities’ privacy policies. In some cases, these third-party entities may not have any online presence. Therefore, you should only submit your Personal Information in these cases when you are comfortable doing so given the conditions.  If you have questions about the privacy practices of these third-party entities, we encourage you to contact them and review their privacy policies. 

For additional information about third-party entities that may collect and use your Personal Information in connection with your use of the Services, and the rights and choices you have to control or limit the collection and use of your Personal Information by these third-party entities, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/) and the following Sections of this Privacy Policy: [Section 8 (Your Privacy Rights & Choices)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-8), [Section 9 (Additional Privacy Rights of U.S. Residents)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-9), and [Section 10 (Use of The Services By Users From Outside The United States)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-10)[\[LN6\]](#_msocom_6) .  

**8\. What Are Your Rights & Choices?**

This Section 8 of the Privacy Policy describes your legal rights and choices regarding how we use your Personal Information. This Section 8 of the Privacy Policy also describes how you exercise those rights and choices.

### i. _Email_

As part of the Services, we may offer customers like you a variety of different email newsletters and other commercial emails. The Services are supported by advertising revenue. We may send you commercial emails on behalf of ourselves, our Affiliates, and our third-party advertisers. You can unsubscribe to these emails by either following the instructions in the email for opting-out of receiving future emails, or by calling the official customer service number listed in the “Contact Us” webpage of the Website of the newspaper publication from which you are receiving emails and making a request to no longer receive emails.

### ii. _Promotions Via Mail or Telephone_

Sometimes, we may contact you via mail or telephone with promotions for our Services.  You can ask us to opt-out these mail or telephone solicitations. In certain jurisdictions, as is discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, you may also have the right to instruct us to not share your Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.  To opt-out of future mail or telephone solicitations regarding the Services, please call the official customer service number listed in the “Contact Us” webpage of the Website of the newspaper publication from which you are receiving mail or telephone solicitations and make a request to no longer receive them.

### iii. _SMS/Text Message Alerts_

If you receive marketing-related SMS/text message alerts from us in connection with the Services, you can opt-out of receiving them by replying “STOP” or any alternate keyword that we have shared with you. We will work to implement your opt-out request quickly and within the timeframes required by applicable laws. However, please note that your opt-out request will not prohibit us from sending you important non-marketing SMS/text message alerts about your account or use of the Services.  

### iv. _Push Notifications_

You can opt-out of receiving push notifications from us by changing your settings on the device that is sending you push notifications from us, or by uninstalling the Application that is sending you push notifications from us.

### v. _Platform & Web Browser Controls_

* **Cookie Controls & Settings** 

As is discussed in [Section 3.2.3](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-3-2-3) of this Privacy Policy in and our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy), when you access the Services via the Internet or an Internet-connected device, we may place or collect “cookies” from your web browser or device, and we may use these cookies for various purposes. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, some of these cookies may constitute your Personal Information under applicable law.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, you can configure the settings of your web browser to delete or reject cookies. Additionally, the Websites on which we provide the Services offer you the capability to choose certain cookie preferences about whether or not your web browser will accept – or instead will block/reject – certain cookies from our Websites. **To implement your personal cookie preferences on our Websites, please click on the “Cookie Preferences” link at the bottom of the webpage of the Website to access the cookie preferences menu.**

Once you have opened the cookie preferences menu, you can choose whether your web browser will accept or block/reject certain types of cookies from the Website. In the cookie preferences menu, you can also opt-out of certain uses of Personal Information we collect about you via cookies, such as our “sale” or use in targeted advertising. For additional information about opting-out of our “sales” or targeted advertising, please refer to Section 9 of this Privacy Policy ([Your California Privacy Rights](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Your_California_Rights)).

Please review, and be aware of, the following regarding your choice to delete, reject, or otherwise opt-out of cookies in connection with your use of the Services:

* If you choose to delete or reject cookies on your web browser or device, this could affect certain features or Services that we provide via our Websites and Applications;
* These cookie-blocking and opt-out mechanisms are unique to your computer, tablet, device, and web browser, which means that you will need to re-implement your cookie blocking our opt-out preferences on each such computer, tablet, device, and web browser that you use;  
* If you clear or delete your cookies on your device or web browser after opting-out of cookies or configuring our cookie preferences menu to block or reject cookies, this will result in the deletion of the opt-out or blocking cookie on your web browser or device, meaning you will need to opt-out or configure our cookie preferences menu again after clearing or deleting the cookies (this may also apply to “Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information” signals/preferences that you implement via our cookies preferences menu on our Websites); and
* After you opt-out of cookies or configure your personalized cookie preferences on our Websites to block/reject cookies, you may continue to receive advertising via our Services, but those ads may be less relevant to you.  

For additional information about cookies, implementing your personalized cookie preferences on our Websites, and how we collect and use cookies, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/).  Please also refer to [Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy (Your Additional Rights and Choices For Third Parties & Our Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising Practices)](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-8-2) for additional information about how to opt-out of cookies and similar technologies using third-party opt-out mechanisms. 

* **Global Privacy Control (GPC)**

Some web browsers and browser extensions support the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) (“GPC”), which can send a signal to the websites you visit that indicates your choice to opt-out of certain types of uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, including sales of your Personal Information.  For users of the Services in certain jurisdictions, when we detect a GPC signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your privacy-related choices that are identified by the GPC signal we detected and the GPC setting you implemented, as required by applicable laws. 

* **Do Not Track (DNT)**

Some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) setting that can send a signal to the websites that you visit, which indicates that you do not wish to be tracked by the websites.  However, unlike the GPC signals described above, there is no common understanding of how to interpret such DNT signals as of the “Last Updated Date” of this Privacy Policy.  As such, our Websites and Applications **do not** respond to web browser DNT signals. However, as is discussed above in this Privacy Policy, you may change the privacy preferences in your web browser to prevent or limit the use of cookies or similar technologies.  To learn more about managing, blocking, and deleting cookies, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/). As is discussed above, blocking or deleting cookies or similar technologies may affect your browsing experience on our Websites and may prevent you from accessing or using certain of our Services, including some of the personalized features that we provide to users as part of the Services.  

* **Mobile Advertising ID Controls for iOS and Android Users**

Mobile devices running on iOS and Android operating systems provide options about how to limit tracking and/or reset advertising IDs. You may be able to implement these options on your iOS or Android mobile device that you use to access the Services. For more information about advertising IDs and how to implement advertising ID controls and choices on your iOS or Android mobile device in connection with your use of the Services, please click [here](https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/).  Please refer to the bullet titled “Mobile Device Settings” under Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy below for additional information.

As is discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/), when you access or use our Services on the Internet via any of our Websites, Applications, or Platform, we use various third-party service providers and technologies to serve you tailored advertising for products, services, and content that we think you might be interested in. This interest-based advertising often uses your Personal Information (such as your cookies, browsing history, or IP address) to serve you relevant ads via our Services. These third parties that provide the interest-based advertising services and technologies we use on our Services may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting.  We do not maintain or control these opt-out mechanisms, which are provided and controlled by non-affiliated third parties.  Furthermore, we do not control which third parties participate in these opt-out mechanisms.  Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Services, but these ads may be less relevant to your interests.

To maximize the effectiveness of your opt-out for interest-based advertising, you should register your choice through all of these mechanisms and on each web browser and/or mobile device that you use to access the Services:

**9\. Additional Privacy Rights and Choices of U.S. Residents**
===============================================================

**9.1 Your California Privacy Rights**
--------------------------------------

**Notice For California Residents**

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“**CCPA**”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“**CPRA**”) (the CPPA and CPRA, collectively the “**California Privacy Laws**”) gives California residents certain rights and choices about how we collect, use, and disclose their Personal Information. This Section 9.1 of this Privacy Policy (the “**California Notice**”) describes these additional rights and choices and provides disclosures required by the California Privacy Laws about how we collect, use, and disclose California residents’ Personal Information.

This California Notice applies to information of California residents that constitutes “Personal Information” under the California Privacy Laws to the extent that we handle such California Personal Information in our capacity as a business under the California Privacy Laws. For purposes of this California Notice Section of this Privacy Policy, the capitalized term “Personal Information” refers to information of California residents that constitutes “personal information” under the California Privacy Laws, as distinguished from the general definition of Personal Information set forth under Section 1.1 of this Privacy Policy. As a practical matter, if you are a California resident that uses the Services, there is likely little or no difference between Personal Information as used in this California Notice Section of the Privacy Policy and the definition of Personal Information provided above in Section 1.1. This California Notice does not apply to information exempt from, or otherwise not subject to, the requirements of the California Privacy Laws. 

**California Notice at Collection – The Personal Information That We Collect**

We currently collect, and within the 12 months prior to the “Last Updated” date of this Privacy Policy have collected, the following categories of Personal Information:

* Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or other similar information.
* Inferences drawn from Personal Information to create a profile about a consumer.

The California Privacy Laws (i.e., the CCPA as amended by the CPRA) grants California residents the rights described below. These rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exemptions. As such, in certain cases, we may deny your requests regarding these rights as permitted by law.

1. **Right to Know.** The right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of Personal Information, the categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing (if applicable), the categories of third parties to whom we sell or share Personal Information (if applicable), and the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;
2. **Right to Delete.** The right to delete Personal Information that we collected about you, subject to certain exceptions;
3. **Right to Correct.** The right to correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you;

6. **Right to Not Receive Discriminatory Treatment.** The right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of the privacy rights the CCPA confers.

You will not receive any discriminatory treatment from us for exercising any of the privacy rights granted to you by the CCPA.

**Right to Opt-Out.** You have a right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your Personal Information.  As stated above, we do not “sell” your Personal Information in the traditional sense (i.e., for money).  However, we may disclose your Personal Information in the following ways that may constitute a “sale” and/or “share” of your Personal Information within the legal definitions of those terms under the California Privacy Laws:

* Like many news media companies, we use services that help us deliver interest-based ads to you on our Websites, Applications, and Platform, such as the services associated with cookies described in this Privacy Policy and our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/).  Our use of these services may constitute a “sale” or “share” of your Personal Information for purposes of the California Privacy Laws, because the advertising partners we use that provide these services collect information from our users, including Personal Information, when users visit our Websites, Applications, or Platform (e.g., device data, cookies, online activity, IP address, as described above) to help serve ads to users that are more likely to be of interest to them.

**10\. Use of The Services by Users from Outside The United States**
====================================================================

We have worked hard to ensure that our business complies with applicable international consumer data privacy laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”), the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “**UK GDPR”),** and others.  Under applicable law in the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland, MNG is considered a “data controller” of the Personal Information that we handle under this Privacy Policy.  In other words, MNG is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose this Personal Information, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears at the end of this Privacy Policy.  Under applicable laws, if you are a resident of certain jurisdictions outside of the United States and use the Services, you may be able to request one or more individual rights set forth in the “Your EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland Rights & Choices” Section of this Privacy Policy below.  

**10.1 Your EU, EEA, UK, & Switzerland Rights & Choices.**
----------------------------------------------------------

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, we are a data controller of your Personal Information. We are headquartered in the United States, where we store and process information relating to the use of the Services, including your Personal Information.  If you are located outside of the United States, your Personal Information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States – or another country in which we (or our service providers) operate. 

If we transfer your Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area, we implement at least one of the following safeguards:

* We transfer your Personal Information to countries that the European Commission has determined provide an adequate level of data protection (a full list of these countries can be found [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)).
* We take steps to ensure that the recipient of your Personal Information is bound by contractual obligations, including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“**SCCs**”) and additional safeguards to protect your Personal Information (you may review the EU SCCs that came into effect in September 2021 [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en)).

The courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in these countries may sometimes be entitled to access your Personal Information under applicable laws.

If you are a resident of the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have certain privacy rights under applicable laws, which include:

* Your right to access and copy certain Personal Information that we maintain about you;
* Your right to correct or update Personal Information that we maintain about you information that is incorrect or outdated;
* Your right to prevent the processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes (including direct marketing processing based on profiling);
* Your right to delete certain Personal Information that we maintain about you;
* Your right to transfer the Personal Information that we hold about you to a third-party service provider;
* Your right to restrict the way we process and disclose certain of your Personal Information; and
* Your right to revoke your consent to the processing of your Personal Information.

If you reside in a country other than one of those listed above, you may be able to make a request to us to exercise one or more of the rights listed above under applicable laws.  In order to make such a request to us, you may contact us at [MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com](mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com).  So that we may respond to your request, we may need to verify your identity, country of residence, or require that you provide us with additional information. 

If applicable, if you think your rights have been violated, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country in which you reside or seek a remedy through the local court system. However, we encourage you to first [contact us](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/contact-us/) with any questions or concerns if you feel your rights have been violated. 

**Your Additional Marketing & Interest-Based Advertising Choices**

Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/cookie-policy/) has information about how to manage your cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to personalized advertising. Additional information about how to op-out of cookies and similar technologies that we use on the Services for online analytics and interest-based advertising purposes is also detailed in [Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy (Your Additional Rights & Choices For Third Parties & Our Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising Practices](https://www.medianewsgroup.com/privacy-policy/#Section-8.2)).

If you reside in the EU, EEA, UK, Canda, or Switzerland you may opt-out of (i.e., withdraw your consent to) receiving marketing emails from us by following the instructions in such emails.  You may also withdraw your consent to our use of your email to provide you with special offers via email and through certain other means (such as Social Media) by emailing us at [MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com](mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com).

**What is Our Legal Basis?**

In certain jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we may only collect, use, or share Personal Information about you if we have a valid reason (i.e., a “lawful basis”).  A valid reason (i.e., a “lawful basis”) is one of the following:

* You provide us with your consent at the point of collection of your Personal Information;
* The performance of a contract that we have with you;
* Our compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to;
* Our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party.  A “legitimate interest” is a special legal term under international privacy laws, like the GDPR, which essentially means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights.  The term “legitimate interest” can also refer to our use of your Personal Information in ways that you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal impact on your privacy rights. 

We have legitimate interests in gathering and processing Personal Information.  Our legitimate interests include, but are not necessarily limited to: administering and conducting business within MNG; ensuring that our networks, Services, Websites, Applications, Platform, and information are secure; conducting our marketing activities; and preventing fraud. 

**IAB EU Transparency and Consent Framework**

We participate in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and comply with its Specifications and Policies. We use the Consent Management Platform with the identification number 279.

**11\. How Can You Access, Correct, Or Update Your Personal Information?**
==========================================================================

You may request that we provide you with access to the Personal Information that we have about you, or that we update or correct the Personal Information that we have about you.  Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may have a legal right to request access to the Personal Information we have about you under applicable laws.  Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you also may have a legal right under applicable laws to request that we correct or update certain Personal Information that we have about you.  Some of our Websites may allow you to access, correct, or update some of your Personal Information directly (i.e., user profile information) by logging in to the relevant portions of the Services where such information may be updated. In accordance with applicable laws, you may also request access to the Personal Information that we have about you and/or request that we correct or update certain Personal Information that we have about you by emailing us at [MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com](mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com). 

Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable laws, even if you request that we update, correct, or delete Personal Information that we hold about you, we may need to retain certain of your Personal Information to comply with our legal obligations or otherwise for our legitimate record-keeping and business purposes. Please refer to Section 14 of this Privacy Policy (How Long Do We Retain Your Information?) for additional information.  

**12\. What About Linked Third-Party Services, Sites, & Advertisements That I See Via The Services?**
=====================================================================================================

Some of the Services may sometimes contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors, advertisers, and other products and services. These are not part of the Services we provide to you. We do not control (and are not responsible for) the privacy practices, websites, content, and goods or services of these third parties. 

As is discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, these third parties may independently collect and solicit Personal Information about you directly from you. The Personal Information that you provide to them directly is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  These third parties have their own privacy policies and practices, which may include what (if any) of your Personal Information they share with us, your privacy rights and choices with respect to their services and devices, and whether they process and store information in the United States or outside of the United States. As such, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies, practices, and terms of use and to contact them if you have any questions, concerns, or want to opt-out or limit how they collect or use your Personal Information.   

**13\. How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?**
=====================================================

We have endeavored to protect the privacy, security, and integrity of your Personal Information using what we believe to be appropriate administrative, technical, organizational, and physical security controls and measures (collectively, “**Security Measures**”). These Security Measures may vary based on a variety of factors, including, the sensitivity of the Personal Information about you that we process and maintain, the state of technology, and applicable laws.

The purpose of our Security Measures is to protect your Personal Information from accidental or unauthorized access, alteration, destruction, disclosure, loss, use, or illegal processing. Although we take maintaining the security and integrity of the Personal Information that we hold about you extremely seriously, we cannot guarantee that our Security Measures will provide your Personal Information with absolute security or that your Personal Information will never be used in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security and integrity of the Personal Information that we maintain about you at any time.  In accordance with applicable law, we will notify you electronically, in writing, by telephone, and/or by other means in the event that we become subject to a data breach involving the unauthorized or unlawful use of the Personal Information about you that we maintain.  

**Safeguarding Communications**

From time to time, via the Services, we may send you emails, text messages, mobile device push notifications, or other communications, which communications may contain your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information (such as your name, email address, password to your account for the Services, or billing or payment information).  Safeguarding any such Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information contained in any such communications by us to you is solely your responsibility.  We are not responsible for safeguarding any such communications once they are sent to you.  

**14\. How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information?**
=========================================================

We retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to: (1) fulfil the purposes for which we collect it (for example, for as long as is necessary to provide you with the Services that you have requested); and (2) satisfy any legal, accounting, contractual, record keeping, or reporting requirements that apply to us. This means that we might retain your Personal Information even after you close your account with us. 

After the applicable retention period for your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize your Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws.  If deletion or anonymization of your Personal Information is not possible, in accordance with applicable laws, we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

If you stop visiting our Websites for at least 13 months, we may mark your account for removal.  In that case, your account information will remain for another 12 months and then may be removed. 

**15\. What Are the Requirements or Guidelines for The Use of Our Services By Children?**
=========================================================================================

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.  The Services are not intended to be accessed or used by persons under the age of 18.  By using the Services, you hereby represent that you are at least 18 years of age. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect or solicit any Personal Information online from children under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for an account or other subscription to the Services from us. Some third parties, such as platform providers like the iTunes Store or Google Play may provide age-based ratings on some of the Services.  These ratings shall have no bearing on this limitation.  Third parties may also provide content categories on some of the Services.  These categories likewise shall have no bearing on this limitation.

If you believe that a child under age 16 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us immediately via email at [MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com](mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com).  Once received, we will take appropriate action with respect to that child’s Personal Information in accordance with our obligation under applicable laws. 

**16\. Changes to This Privacy Policy.**
========================================

MNG may update this Privacy Policy at our discretion at any time. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically to review any changes or updates to this Privacy Policy and our privacy-related practices. In the event of any material changes or updates, we will post the updated version here and will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. 

**17\. No Rights of Third Parties.**
====================================

This Privacy Policy does not create rights for the benefit of, or enforceable by, any third parties. 

**18\. Complaints.** 
=====================

We take your privacy very seriously.  Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, if you believe we have violated your privacy rights, you may have the right to lodge a complaint against us with the appropriate data protection supervisory authority in the jurisdiction in which you reside.  However, we encourage you to first contact us via email to [MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com](mailto:MNGPrivacy@medianewsgroup.com) should you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our privacy-related practices.
