Privacy
=======

We will only use any information you provide for the purpose you gave it to Together 4 Change. If you wish to unsubscribe from any Together 4 Change forum or network please let us know by using our contact form which can be found [here](https://together4change.org/contact-us/). We normally process unsubscription requests within 24 hours.

We will not give or sell your personal information to anyone unless we are required to by law or there is an issue of safety.

We believe your right to confidentiality is very important. This means that only in very unusual circumstances would it be necessary for us to contact the police or other agencies about any message we have received.

Legal requirements related to confidentiality

Under UK law, Together 4 Change cannot legally provide confidentiality under the following circumstances:

1\. A message sent to or through Together 4 Change (including discussion forum posts) contains specific information about a terrorist suspect or terrorist activity that will take place or has taken place in the world. This information must immediately be disclosed to the police;

2\. Together 4 Change is forced through legal action to disclose specific confidential information; this can include legal action taken through the Data Protection Act and during criminal investigations.

Our choice to break confidentiality

Under the Data Protection Act we can choose to break confidentiality if we feel that doing so would be in the public interest or that not doing so would hinder a criminal investigation. Under very rare, extreme circumstances, we may choose to break confidentiality.

These circumstances are:

If we believe a user of a Together 4 Change forum or network is in immediate and great danger, or a user of a Together 4 Change forum or network is about to place another person in immediate and great danger.

And

That the user has provided enough personal information for us to believe there is an opportunity to intervene.

We wouldn’t even think of trying to intervene if the circumstances were not extreme.

Our address is Together 4 Change, Suite 223, 266 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DL, United Kingdom.
