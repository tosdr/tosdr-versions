What data do we process when you use the Wysa Digital Front Door Service?

Wysa Digital front door application allows your Institution to triage you and your dependents to authorised care and support resources. The service redirects you to authorised support resources based on your pronouns, country, service group, language choice, support choice and self-reported mood assessments. Support resources include the Institution’s EAP, the Wysa App and other Institution provided services. Access to the Wysa front door service will be via your Institution provided Single Sign-on (SSO) mechanism. Where required and on behalf of your Institution, we may integrate our App and Services with your Institution’s authentication mechanism such as Single Sign On (SSO). SSO enables you to use your Institution credentials to sign-in and access authorised Wysa App and Services and other third-party services. Wysa App will redirect you to your Institution’s SSO web page during your first access. The SSO processing is done by your Institution to verify your identity and direct you to the Wysa App. Your personal information, submitted during sign-in, is not transferred or stored in the Wysa system. Wysa will receive a one-time unique and encrypted identifier, which will be used to generate a random user identifier to associate you to the App and Services. Wysa will keep track of your login status and inform your Institution of any change to allow your Institution to manage future SSO requests. If you have any questions about your use of SSO please contact your Institution directly. No personal data is collected or processed during your use of the Wysa digital front door application and service. Wysa shall share population-level and aggregated analytics on App engagement and use with your Institution. You can delete your data at any time by selecting the “Reset my data” option available within the App.

Where required, Wysa will integrate with your Institution authorised information systems to process and transfer contracted data. We will maintain appropriate agreements with your Institution before any data processing or sharing.

We will also generate reports for your Institution. Only aggregated and anonymised data, at a population or cohort level, will be used for the Institution’s reporting needs. These reports will be generated and shared with your Institution as downloadable files via secure analytic dashboards. Your individual insights will never be shared with your Institution without your consent.

We may provide anonymised or agreed upon minimal user level data with some of our Institutions. This would be for provisioning of Services and/or where it helps the Institutions provide better care for you. We clearly inform the Institution and within our contracts with them about their responsibility to protect your rights and freedom at all times.

We may process additional health data (such as substance abuse, gender among others) on behalf of healthcare Institutions as a Business Associate. We adhere to privacy by design principles and minimize and limit processing of any personal identifiers. We ensure compliance to US HIPAA by enforcing administrative, organisational and technical controls to safeguard the privacy and security of any health data that we may process

Where required by your Institution, we may guide you to appropriate support and crisis resources. These would be both within and external to the App including Institution provided helplines, EAP, offline care services and therapist support. This processing is not intended to be an emergency response and is performed to safeguard individuals at-risk.

How do we secure your data?

The security of your data is very important to us, and we work hard to secure it. We have implemented adequate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data. Some of the steps we have taken to secure your data include:

**Privacy by Design and Default**

1. There is no user registration required. We don’t need it hence we don’t ask for it.
2. Only a nickname is sufficient to help us personalize our conversation with you.
3. We use pseudonymised identifiers to protect your data and identity.
4. No human eavesdrops during your conversation with the AI coach.
5. The AI Coach will always check if it has understood you correctly before progressing.
6. We use algorithms that irreversibly redact any inadvertent personal identifiers entered in English.
7. You can opt-out at any time using the “reset my data” feature available in the App settings.
8. We adhere to the 7 key principles set out by GDPR (see [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/)).
9. We perform Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for personal data processing.

**Security by Design**

1. We use TLS and SSL encryption during transfer and AES-256 protocol at rest.
2. Random identifiers are used for all data transactions between AI Coach and our servers.
3. Our systems are secured with role-based access, strong passwords and two-step verification.
4. We enable endpoint security in all staff systems.
5. We review and maintain data processing agreements with our service providers.
6. We have a strict hiring and background verification process in place.
7. We provide regular awareness and training to our staff.
8. We conduct annual 3rd party compliance audits and data protection certifications.
9. We perform regular penetration tests of our Apps and Infrastructure.
10. We conduct regular checks to ensure compliance to our policies.

**Certifications and Registrations**

No method of electronic transmission or method of data storage is perfect or impenetrable. While we try our best to implement controls to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. To ensure your data is secure, we require your cooperation as well. Please do not copy and share your conversations with unknown people.

How does the Artificial Intelligence chatbot work and is it safe to use?

At Wysa, we use proprietary Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing/Understanding (NLP/NLU) algorithms (“AI”) to understand your messages. NLP/NLU algorithms are classification techniques that are used to understand what you write. This allows the AI to maintain a conversation with you and guide you to appropriate resources. Our values require that our AI used within the App is transparent, trusted, safe and privacy protecting. All the AI used in our Apps are “FIXED” or “CLOSED”, and all chatbot responses to the user are created with clinical input and subjected to detailed safety testing before being deployed. There are no generative (those that 'create' the response to the user on the fly) or adaptive models (i.e. those that continually adapt or learn every time on their own) in use. The algorithms run at conversational nodes within a decision-tree structure.

The primary purpose of the AI-based processing is

1. to provide an interactive safe-by-design approach to converse and journal via text with the chatbot.
2. to detect and retain limited context from your messages to personalize and provide empathetic and safe conversations.
3. to detect at-risk situations, such as any SOS, self-harm and abuse triggers, so as to signpost users to clinically validated supportive resources and helplines.

Wysa complies with UK NHS Digital’s DCB 0129 clinical risk management standards to ensure a safe-by-design approach to our AI-based services.

Your use of Wysa+ Generative AI Services

We use third-party Generative AI technology services for our Wysa+ GAI Services. **Wysa+** represents the next generation of Wysa, designed to generate static, quality and clinically validated content that provide a high performing, safe and improved user experience with our AI based Services. No personal data gets shared with these third-party services. Wysa+ GAI Service is provided as a deterministic framework which follows the same safety-based structure as the regular Wysa services. This means that every Wysa+ GAI Services use case is tested for repeatability and clinical safety, and is used within an overall clinically approved flow.

Generated content needs to pass our safety and quality guardrails before being accepted for use. All generated content scripts are rigorously quality checked for clinically validated and safe responses using a therapist-in-the-loop for safety, privacy, quality and performance. Only validated features get released within our App and Services. Where applicable, We will transparently inform you and seek your consent before enabling the Generative AI technology on the Wysa App.

Refer the additional [Wysa+ Generative AI Terms of Use](https://legal.wysa.io/generative-ai/terms) and [Wysa+ Generative AI Privacy Policy](https://legal.wysa.io/generative-ai/privacy-policy) to be informed about our Wysa+ GAI Service and how we handle and process your provided data during the use of this Service.
