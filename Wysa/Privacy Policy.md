Latest Revised Date: October 1, 2024 (GMT)  
Version: 6.0.0**

Read about our Use of Generative AI privacy policy [here](https://legal.wysa.io/wysa-plus/privacy-policy)

Our privacy policy explains what we do with your provided information when you use our website or web pages ([wysa.com](https://www.wysa.com/)), web-based or mobile-based app software (“app”) and its services.

You may try out one or more services made available to you. These include:

* A text or voice-based digital coach powered by an Artificial Intelligence chatbot (“AI Coach”).
* Clinically verified tools delivered over text or voice (“Digital tools”).
* Text or audio-video chats with a human mental health and well-being expert (“Wysa Coach”).
* Text or audio-video chats with a Chronic Care Management professional (“Wysa Medical Assistant”).
* Use our Digital Front Door and get access to different Institutional services (“e-triage”).
* Use the AI Coach powered by Generative AI (“Wysa+”).

The app is made to help you feel happier by showing you ways to take care of your mental health and well-being. The app does not tell you if you have a disease or condition, or how to treat it. The app gives general advice for your mental health and well-being. The AI Coach is an AI technology powered software, not a real person, so it can only help in restricted ways. It does not give medical advice. If you need medical advice, it will suggest seeing a local clinician. It cannot give specific advice for complex health problems.

We will work with your public institution, healthcare institution, educational institution or other organization to offer our services. These are called Institutional services. Before you can use these services, you will need to agree to our rules and the rules of your Institution.

By using our website, web pages, app and services, you agree that we can use your information as described in this privacy policy and any other related policies. If you use our Wysa+ service, then the Wysa+ privacy policy will also apply to you.

4\. How We Protect Your Information

**Where is your information stored**  
The information we collect is saved and kept safe in our cloud servers managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Some of your information might be shared and stored with our third-party service providers to provide our services.

**How long do we keep your information**

**When you use our app**  

When you send us text messages, any personal identifier you share is removed and saved in a way that cannot be undone. We keep this information only for as long as we need to follow the law. If there is no specific time limit mentioned, we keep your information for up to 10 years from the last time you updated it. You can also choose to delete all your conversation data forever by using the 'reset my data' option in the app settings.

**Your correspondence data**  

When you email us, we use the information you give to help you. We keep your emails safe in our Google Workspace account, and only certain staff can look at them. We will keep your email for up to 10 years from the last time you contacted us.

**Information received from your Institution**  

We keep your information for the time your Institution has decided. After that time, we delete your information forever. Once you send us your information, we cannot change it. If you need to fix something or have any questions, please talk to your Institution.

**Data Security**  

We use physical, organizational, and technical safeguards to keep your information safe. Here are some ways we do that:

**Protecting your privacy**

1. You do not need to register to use the app.
2. Just give us a nickname so our chatbot knows what to call you.
3. We use masked identifiers to keep your data and identity safe.
4. No real people can listen to what you are talking about with the AI Coach.
5. The AI Coach will always make sure it understands you before moving on.
6. If you accidentally share personal data, we will make sure to remove it so no one can see it.
7. As an app user, you can choose "reset my data" to delete your information.
8. Before we use any personal data about you, we make sure it respects your rights.

**Protecting your security**

1. We use strong encryption to protect your data when it is being sent or stored.
2. Only authorised people can access your data. They have to use strong passwords and an additional access code.
3. All our staff computers have extra security.
4. We maintain contracts with companies we work with to keep your data safe.
5. We carefully check the background of new staff before hiring them.
6. We train our staff on how to handle your information securely.
7. We have experts from outside our company check if we are following the rules every year.
8. We regularly test our app and systems for any weaknesses.
9. We fix any problems in our computer code to make sure it is safe.
10. We often check to make sure we are following our safety plans and rules.

**Responsible use of Artificial Intelligence**

At Wysa, we use artificial intelligence (AI) programs to understand what you type to us. These programs help us talk with you in a way that makes sense and guides you to helpful information. Our programs follow set rules and do not learn new things on their own. We make sure our AI chatbot is fair, safe, and treats your information with care. If you use the Wysa+ service, we use Generative AI technology to assist you. We have safety measures in place to keep our conversations secure and trustworthy. We also have good practices to monitor and check the use of AI at Wysa, making sure your rights are protected. Please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have any more questions about our use of AI.

We do our best to keep your personal data safe, but no method is perfect. We cannot promise complete security. You can help keep your data safe too. Please do not copy and share your chats with people you do not know.

**Payment Data**

We do not collect, keep, or store your credit card information. Third-party payment companies handle your card processing. We do not get any personal data from app stores after you buy something or from our third-party payment providers. However, we might note the name of the business for our internal purposes. Please read the payment gateway’s terms and privacy policy before you make a payment. We do receive and handle payment confirmations and subscription details. This is to help you with your subscription requests.

**Third-Party Sites**

The app might have links to other websites or resources. When you click on these links, remember that these other sites have their own rules about privacy. We do not control these other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy rules. It is a good idea to read their privacy rules before you share any personal data on those sites.

**Children’s Privacy**

The app is intended for anyone who is older than 13 years or where provided by your Institution, follow the age criteria and rules set by your Institution. If you are a child, please ask your parent or guardian to read this policy and the terms of service with you. Wysa does not take responsibility if someone lies about their age to use the app and services.

It is very important for us to protect children's privacy on the app. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you think we have any personal data of your child, please write to us. We will respond within one month after verifying the information. If we cannot identify the user correctly, we might not be able to address your request. However, if we find we have collected personal data from your child, we will deactivate their account and delete the data.

We encourage parents and guardians to watch over their children's internet use. Tell your children not to give out personal information without your permission. You should not share your credit/debit card or other payment methods with your child to make in-app purchases.

**Best Practices**

We want to help you stay safe online. Here are some important tips to stay secure:

* Always lock your mobile screen with a password. Make sure it is strong and do not share it with anyone. Never leave your device alone.
* Always update your mobile’s operating system to the latest version.
* Turn on remote access on your device so you can find and control it if it gets stolen.
* Install anti-virus software to protect your device from viruses.
* Be careful with emails. Do not open files, click on links, or download anything from sources you do not know.
* Be smart about using Wi-Fi. Before sending personal or important data over a public Wi-Fi in places like a coffee shop or airport, check if the network is safe.

* * *

5\. Who We Share Information With

**Service Providers**  
We work with third party companies that help us run our app, fix any problems, and offer other important services. These companies might use your personal data to provide services for us. For a list of service providers please read [here](https://legal.wysa.io/wysa-service-providers.html).

**Legal**  
We sometimes need to use your personal data to follow the law. This might mean sharing your information with other people like insurance companies, courts, police, or other important organisations. We might also use your information to stop serious health or safety problems, for public health reports, and to keep information safe during legal situations so it is not changed. Also, we might share your information to help with finding out or stopping fraud or crime. We will make sure your rights and interests are protected.

**Reorganization**  
In situations like when we might sell our business, join up with another company, reorganize, or are facing bankruptcy, we may need to share some of your personal data with others. These third parties will use your information to look at the business deal. After these changes happen, we might also share your information with the new company for the same purposes mentioned in this privacy notice. We will try to let you know by putting a notice on our website, telling your Institution, sending you a notification in the app, or updating this privacy notice.

* * *

6\. Sharing Information Outside Your Country

Sometimes we need to share, store, and manage your information with our service providers. These service providers might be in countries where data protection is not as strong as it is here. We have agreements with our service provider that include data protection rules to keep your data safe.

We only share the necessary data between our Wysa offices to provide you with the best service. We use strong technology to keep your data safe.

If you have any questions about how we send your data to other countries, you can email us at [\[email protected\]](https://legal.wysa.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

7\. Your Data Protection Rights

**When you trigger “Reset my data” from app settings**

The "Reset my Data" feature is found in the app settings of the app. If you use this feature, all your conversation information, including your ID, past chats, reminders, assessment answers, and settings will be deleted from our system. Once you reset, you cannot get back any of your old conversations and you will be treated like a new user. So, think carefully before using this feature.

* No Sale: You can choose to stop your personal data from being sold or shared with others who might want to sell it.
* Automated Decisions: Our service uses AI to help you. We do not use AI to know your identity. We always check with you before making key suggestions. We change our conversation anytime you inform us that the AI is not helping. We and our service providers might use AI to make automated decisions or automatically process information if we need to perform our services or to stop fraud, abuse or misuse of our services. By using our services, you consent to let us use AI for this purpose. We might change the automated approach we use in the future.

**How to Exercise Your Rights**

You do not usually have to pay anything to use your rights. Sometimes, we might need to check if it is really you asking. Contact us using the details at the top of this privacy notice. We will reply within one month if you ask us for something.

If a data breach could seriously affect your rights and freedom, we will let you know as required by data protection laws.

**When We Might Say “No”**  
We might not be able to agree to your request if:

* The law says we cannot.
* It affects someone else’s privacy.
* It could harm you, us, or someone else.
* The request is too much or does not make sense.

* * *
