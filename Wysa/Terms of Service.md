Call your local emergency service or tell your parents or guardian so they can get you help. In such cases, your Institution may or may not require us to send alerts which might contain information that helps them identify you so that they can take necessary steps to support you.
2. Currently the app is available in English, and select Indian languages.
3. You should be the right age to use the app. Your Institution may set age limits. If you say you are older than you are, that is not okay, and Wysa is not responsible for it.
4. We do not ask for your personal data unless it is needed for your Institution. We only collect the data we need to help you. Read our privacy policy and related policies to understand how we use your data.
5. The AI Coach is an AI technology powered software, not a real person, so it can only help in restricted ways. It will not offer medical or clinical advice and only suggest that you seek medical help.
