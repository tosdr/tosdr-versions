**By making use of the GOOSE VPN provision of service you agree to our Terms and Conditions of Use, Privacy and Refund.

**Article 1  General**

1.1 These terms and conditions apply to the agreement between GOOSE and the user related to the delivery of the VPN service by GOOSE. These terms and conditions form an integral part of the agreement.

1.2 The user of GOOSE’s VPN service agrees without any proviso to all Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Statement of GOOSE.

1.3 General terms and conditions or stipulations on the part of the user are expressly rejected by GOOSE.

1.4 Derogations from these provisions will only be valid if these have been expressly agreed and recorded in writing between GOOSE and the user.

**Article 2 Coming into effect of the agreement**

2.1 An offer and/or quotation from GOOSE will be an invitation to the potential user to choose one of the subscriptions. The agreement between GOOSE and the user will come into effect when GOOSE accepts the choice of the user electronically. GOOSE will not be obliged to acceptance thereof.

2.2 The user must generate an account to be able to make use of the VPN service, which account will provide GOOSE with the necessary data for the provision of the service, the payment and the statutory obligations GOOSE must comply with.

2.3 The user must transfer an amount as set out on the website for the verification of the data in the account.

2.4 Following the verification of the account and the acceptance by GOOSE the VPN service will immediately be made available for the user within the preconditions of the chosen subscription.

2.5 The user guarantees the provision of correct personal data to GOOSE, including the address, place of residence, telephone and account numbers. Changes of personal data must be passed onto GOOSE as soon as possible in writing or electronically.

**Article 3 Duration, amendment and termination of the agreement**

3.1 The agreement is entered into for a fixed or indefinite period.

3.2 Following the end of the first agreed period, the agreement for a fixed period will be converted into an agreement for an indefinite period. Unless GOOSE or the user state electronically or in writing prior to the expiry of the agreed period that they do not wish the agreement to continue.

3.3 The user can choose another subscription at any desired time. It is possible to extend or to reduce the subscription. There will be no refund in the event of change to a more restricted (cheaper) subscription. Setoff will take place, if applicable, against a payment already made in the event of change to a more extensive subscription.

3.4 The user can cancel the subscription without statement of reason by means of email, telephone or the cancellation form, within the first 30 days. This arrangement applies only to new users. Commercial users as well as consumers can make use of this arrangement.

4.6 If one of these provisions under these terms and conditions is wholly or in part in conflict with a statutory provision, or is null and void, the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force. A new provision will replace the old earlier provision, whereby the original intention will be approached as closely as possible.

**Article 5 Obligations of the user**

In that case, GOOSE is not liable for possible damage to the user or third party as a result of the decommissioning.

5.14 If the user does not act in accordance with the foregoing provisions, GOOSE is entitled to impose instructions on the user. The user is obliged to follow these. Any financial consequences  are for the account of the user. If this situation occurs, the user cannot claim any refund.

**Article 6 Availability and fair use policy**

6.1 GOOSE arranges the service as it deems most suitable. GOOSE will be entitled to change procedures and the technical aspects of the service.

6.2 GOOSE makes endeavours to be of service to its users in the best possible manner in the field of speed, availability, security and usability. However, GOOSE cannot guarantee this due to inter alia breakdowns, necessary maintenance and adjustments of the system for improvement.

6.3 GOOSE does not apply a strict bandwidth limitation in its most extensive subscription. However, a fair use policy does apply. Users, who use more than 1% of the entire bandwidth of the GOOSE network, will be approached by GOOSE to reduce the use, or to make a higher payment.

**Article 7 Rates and payment**

7.1 Goose charges a payment for the use of the service in accordance with the rates published in GOOSE’s website.

7.5 It is assumed for the recording of the amount of the collection that the user continues with his/her choice of package, unless the user has notified otherwise.

**Article 8 Force Majeure**

8.1 If GOOSE, due to a non-attributable failure (force majeure) cannot fulfil its obligations, the fulfilment of these obligations will be suspended for the duration of the force majeure.

8.2 A failure in the provision of service cannot be attributed to GOOSE if this cannot be blamed on fault on its part, or a cause for which GOOSE is not accountable by law, by legal act or according to generally accepted standards. These circumstances also include, but are not limited to: power failures, war, environmental disasters, breakdowns of the internet connection, breakdowns in the telecommunication infrastructure, breakdowns of networks, failures on the part of engaged third parties, or suppliers, strike actions and business closures.

9.3 GOOSE as well as the user can terminate the agreement if the other party does not properly fulfil one or more of the other party’s obligations on the basis of the agreement, insofar as this failure justifies the termination. If fulfilment is still possible the agreement can only be terminated after the other party has been given demand in writing and the failure is not eliminated within the period stated thereby.

9.4 In the event of (provisional) moratorium, bankruptcy, cessation, or liquidation of (the business of) the user, or if the user is or has become legally incompetent, is placed under a regime of administration, or in any other manner whatsoever loses the free disposition over his/her assets, the agreement will be terminated by operation of law.

The user indemnifies GOOSE against claims by third parties for compensation of damage, which these third parties could (attempt to) recover from GOOSE in any manner whatsoever, due to the fact that use has been made of GOOSE’s service, or as the case may be due to the user not having fulfilled the user’s obligations towards GOOSE.
