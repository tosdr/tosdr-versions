**I. General**
--------------

The term personal data encompasses all information about an identifiable, natural person, including, but not limited to, first and last name, house- and work address, credit card data, e-mail address and other contact details.

If Goose employs the services of a party who processes your personal data in Goose’s name and at Goose’s behest, a processor’s agreement will be made with that party.

**Retention Policy**

Your personal data will not be stored any longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

A request to insight, correction, limitation, protest and transferal of data, removal of your personal data or withdrawal of permission granted earlier can all be made via our contact form.
