Privacy Policy

Share This Page:

The Privacy Act of 1974 establishes certain controls over any personal information collected by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and how it is used. For additional information on your rights under the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), please see [Your Right To Federal Records - Questions and Answers on the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Your_Right_to_Federal_Records.pdf) (PDF).

The OCC respects your privacy. We do not collect or store information about members of the public who call or write the agency or visit our website, unless you identify yourself so that we can respond to an inquiry or request from you.

* We use your personal identifying information only for the purpose for which it is originally collected.
* We maintain your personal identifying information in secure computer systems and limit employee access to those with a business reason to see it.
* We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the OCC, except when compelled by law or in connection with a criminal investigation (as explained below).

* The IP (internet protocol) address from which you access our site. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the world wide web.
* The internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site, if any (for example, www.fdic.gov, if you are following a link from the FDIC website, or www.google.com, if you find us using the Google search engine).
* The type of web browsing software you are using to view our site.
* Your computer's operating system.
* The search terms you enter into our site search application.
* The links you click on pages on our website.
* The date and time you access our site.

Cookies
-------

"Persistent cookies" collect personal information to recognize your computer in the future. The OCC does not use persistent cookies or other technology to collect personally identifiable information (PII) about visitors to our website.

"Temporary" or "session" cookies are used on the OCC.gov web pages to support voluntary customer surveys and to help us accurately analyze how visitors navigate through our website at an aggregated level. These cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session. They do not collect personal information on visitors, and they are erased as soon as you close your web browser. No PII about you is maintained as a result of a temporary or session cookie.

OCC.gov uses Google Analytics Premium to track web traffic. Please refer to the following policies on Google's website for more information:

* [Google's main privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)
* [Cookies and Google Analytics on websites](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage)
* [Opt out of Google Analytics cookies](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en)

We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors. We learn what users like and need; what kind of technology they are using; how often they visit; and other valuable information that helps us offer our visitors the best site possible.

If you are sending electronic mail to the OCC, we want to remind you that email is not necessarily secure against interception. If your information is very sensitive or includes personal or confidential informationâ€”such as your bank account, charge card, or social security numberâ€”you may want to send it by postal mail to the following addresses.

**_When making an inquiry, request, or complaint that requires follow-up:_** If you are making an inquiry or request or filing a complaint that warrants supervisory or other attention, we may need to share your information with others.

* We may need to bring your correspondence to the attention of our attorneys, examiners, or other staff members as appropriate.
* If necessary to address the issue, we may need to share your correspondence with other federal, state, or local agencies responsible for administering or enforcing laws, rules, or regulations, or for investigating known or suspected violations of laws, rules, or regulations, such as the Justice Department or state bank regulators.
* Under limited circumstances, such as a request from Congress or a private individual acting with appropriate legal authority, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.
* If you file a complaint about a national bank or its affiliate, we typically provide your customer identification information along with the complaint to the affected bank. This information is usually necessary for the bank to be able to investigate and correct a problem. In turn, a bank sometimes provides the OCC with additional information about you when it responds to our inquiry. All this information is securely retained in OCC records.

### Privacy Impact Assessments Show

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conducts a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) on information systems that collect personally identifiable information from the public. We prepare PIAs to

* ensure that information handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy;
* determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information system; and
* examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.

Also, PIAs confirm that we use the information for the purpose intended, that the information remains timely and accurate, that it is protected while we have it, and that we hold it only as long as we need it.

### Privacy Act System of Records Notices (SORN) Show

### System of Records Notices (SORNs)

A System of Records is a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires each agency to publish notice of its systems of records in the _Federal Register_.

### What Is a SORN?

A SORN is a formal notice to the public published in the _Federal Register_ that identifies the purpose for which PII is collected, from whom and what type of PII is collected, how the PII is shared externally (routine uses), and how to access and correct any PII maintained by the department.

### When Is a SORN required?

A SORN is required when the department has a system of records as defined above. In some instances, the Department may have an existing SORN that covers a collection of systems or programs. During the Privacy Threshold Analysis and Privacy Impact Assessment processes, our office, in coordination with the bureau privacy officer, will help determine whether a new SORN is required.
