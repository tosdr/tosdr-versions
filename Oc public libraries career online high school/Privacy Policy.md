==============

**Smart Horizons Career Online Education (SHCOE) Privacy Statement**

Smart Horizons Career Online Education (SHCOE) (the “Company”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its users.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Company’s service which can be accessed via sites hosted at [www.nexportcampus.com](http://www.nexportcampus.com/) or our website at [www.shcoe.org](http://www.shcoe.org/). The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of Service.

I. CONSENT

In addition, by using our Service, or services across partnered and unaffiliated sites, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. Each time you visit our website, or use the Service, and any time you voluntarily provide us with information, you agree that you are consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and you are consenting to receive emails or otherwise be contacted, as described in this Privacy Policy.

We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal Information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis.  The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.
