BillGO Copyright Policy
=======================

#### BillGO Website Terms of Service

**EFFECTIVE DATE: OCTOBER 1, 2015**

‍

**Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement**

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and prohibit users from uploading, posting or otherwise transmitting on our website any materials that violate another party’s intellectual property rights. If you believe any materials accessible on or from our website infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access to them) from our website by submitting written notification to our designated Copyright Agent (identified below). When our Copyright Agent receives proper written notice (“**DMCA Notice**”) as described below, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (“**DMCA**”).

Pursuant to the DMCA, your DMCA Notice must include substantially the following:  
‍

1. Your contact information (including your name, postal address, telephone number and email address).
2. Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works on our website, a representative list of such works.
3. Identification of the material on our website you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material, along with a page or location on our website where the infringing material can be found.
4. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
5. A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate.
6. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner, agent or licensee.
7. Your physical or electronic signature.

Our designated Copyright Agent to receive DMCA Notices is:

BillGO, C/O Scott Miller  
3003 E. Harmony Rd, Suite 500  
Fort Collins, CO 80528  
[scott@billgo.com](mailto:scott@billgo.com)

If you fail to substantially comply with the above requirements contained in Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective and we may not have to take corrective measures against the alleged copyright infringement.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially represent that material or activity on our website is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorney’s fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

‍

**Counter-Notification Procedures**

If you have received a DMCA Notice from us and believe that material you posted on our website was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification in response to such DMCA Notice, you may file a counter-notification with us (“**Counter-Notice**”) by submitting written notification to our designated Copyright Agent (identified below).

Pursuant to the DMCA, your Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:

‍

1. Your contact information (including your name, postal address, telephone number and email address).
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.
3. The page or location on our website where the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.
4. A statement under penalty of perjury by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
5. A statement that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States for any judicial district in which the website may be found) and that you accept service from the person (or an agent of that person) who provided our website with the complaint at issue.
6. Your physical or electronic signature.

Completed Counter-Notices should be sent to:

BillGO, C/O Scott Miller  
3003 E. Harmony Rd, Suite 500  
Fort Collins, CO 80528  
[scott@billgo.com](mailto:scott@billgo.com)

The DMCA allows us to restore your material between ten (10) and fourteen (14) business days after receiving your Counter-Notice if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten (10) business days of receiving the copy of your Counter-Notice.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially represent that material or activity on our website is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorney’s fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

‍

**Repeat Infringers**

It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.
