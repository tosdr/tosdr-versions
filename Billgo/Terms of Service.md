2. **Acceptance**.  THIS IS IMPORTANT — BY BROWSING THE WEBSITES, OR BY ACCESSING, VIEWING, DOWNLOADING, OR USING ANY SERVICES, MATERIALS, OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE WEBSITES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TOS AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT APPLY.
3. **TOS Changes**.  BillGO reserves the right to change these TOS by posting an update on this Website and providing a notice on the Websites notifying You that We made such change.  YOUR CONTINUED USE OF A WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES, MATERIALS, OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH A WEBSITE FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF SUCH CHANGES AND NOTICE WILL MEAN THAT YOU ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES.
4. **Privacy**.  To access the Websites or some of the resources they offer, You may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information.
