These Terms govern your access to and use of our products and services, including those offered through our websites, events, communications (e.g., emails, phone calls, and texts) and mobile applications (collectively, the “**Service**”).

5. **CONTENT**
    1. **Responsibility for Your Content.** You alone are responsible for Your Content, and once posted to Yelp, it cannot always be withdrawn. You assume all risks associated with Your Content, including anyone’s reliance on its quality, accuracy, or reliability, and any risks associated with personal information you disclose. You represent that you own or have the necessary permissions to use and authorize the use of Your Content as described herein. You may not imply that Your Content is in any way sponsored or endorsed by Yelp.  
        You may expose yourself to liability if, for example, Your Content contains material that is false, intentionally misleading, or defamatory; violates any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; contains material that is unlawful, including illegal hate speech or pornography; exploits or otherwise harms minors; violates or advocates the violation of any law or regulation; or violates these Terms.
    2. **Our Right to Use Your Content.** We may use Your Content in a number of different ways, including by publicly displaying it, reformatting it, incorporating it into advertisements and other works, creating derivative works from it, promoting it, distributing it, and allowing others to do the same in connection with their own websites and media platforms (“**Other Media**”). As such, you hereby irrevocably grant us world-wide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, assignable, sublicensable, transferable rights to use Your Content for any purpose. Please note that you also irrevocably grant the users of the Service and any Other Media the right to access Your Content in connection with their use of the Service and any Other Media. Finally, you irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Yelp and its users any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content. By “**use**” we mean use, copy, publicly perform and display, reproduce, distribute, modify, translate, remove, analyze, commercialize, and prepare derivative works of Your Content.
    3. **Ownership.** As between you and Yelp, you own Your Content. We own the Yelp Content, including but not limited to visual interfaces, interactive features, graphics, design, compilation (including, but not limited to, our selection, coordination, aggregation, and arrangement of User Content and other Service Content), computer code, products, software, aggregate star ratings, and all other elements and components of the Service excluding Your Content, User Content and Third Party Content. We also own the copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights throughout the world associated with the Yelp Content and the Service, which are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and all other applicable intellectual and proprietary rights and laws. As such, you may not sell, license, copy, publish, modify, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works or adaptations of, publicly display or in any way use or exploit any of the Yelp Content in whole or in part except as expressly authorized by us. Except as expressly and unambiguously provided herein, we do not grant you any express or implied rights, and all rights in and to the Service and the Yelp Content are retained by us.
    4. **Advertising.** Yelp and its licensees may publicly display advertisements, paid content, and other information nearby or in association with Your Content. You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.
    5. **Other.** User Content (including any that may have been created by users employed or contracted by Yelp) does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Yelp. Except as required by law, we have no obligation to retain or provide you with copies of Your Content, and we do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Your Content. Except in accordance with Yelp’s Verified License program, Yelp does not attempt to verify any licenses a local business or its representatives may have, and consumers should inquire about any such licenses with the business directly. Businesses whose licenses have been verified by Yelp will have a “Verified License” badge displayed on their Yelp business page.
    6. **Content Moderation.** Except as required by law, we reserve the right to screen, remove, edit, or reinstate User Content at our sole discretion for any reason or no reason, and without notice to you. For example, we may remove a review if we believe that it violates our [Content Guidelines](http://www.yelp.com/guidelines). If you are a resident of the European Union, you can visit [here](https://www.yelp-support.com/article/Digital-Services-Act?l=en_ie) for more information about Yelp’s content moderation, appeals, and complaint handling processes, consistent with the Digital Services Act.
6. **BOOKING AND TRANSACTING**
    1. **Generally.** You can access features through the Service that allow you to book or transact online with local businesses, such as making restaurant or spa reservations, ordering food delivery, or scheduling appointments. These features may be provided by Yelp’s third-party partners, including through iframes or similar formats, and their use may be governed by different or additional terms presented to you as part of the booking or transaction process. Please note that such third-party partners and/or the transacting local businesses themselves are responsible for fulfilling such bookings and transactions.
    2. **Payments and Cancellations.** You may be required to provide your credit card information to confirm a booking, and will be charged any applicable fees, including cancellation or no-show fees in accordance with the transacting local business’s cancellation policy provided at the time of booking. You agree that Yelp may facilitate any such payments and charges on behalf of the transacting local business.
    3. **Coupons.** Any coupons that Yelp might issue for use in connection with the Service are non-transferable (unless required by law), not redeemable for cash or any other consideration, and automatically expire thirty (30) days after the issue date unless otherwise specified. If your Account is terminated you will not be able to use any unexpired and unused coupons, and any such coupons will automatically terminate and cannot be redeemed unless required by law.

EACH OF THE SUBSECTIONS BELOW ONLY APPLIES UP TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. NOTHING HEREIN IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY LIMITED. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THIS SECTION. YOU ARE GIVING UP SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL RIGHTS BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS.**
    1. THE SERVICE AND SERVICE CONTENT ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU ON AN “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE YELP ENTITIES MAY NOT MONITOR, CONTROL, OR VET USER CONTENT OR THIRD PARTY CONTENT. AS SUCH, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK. THE YELP ENTITIES MAKE NO CLAIMS OR PROMISES ABOUT THE QUALITY, COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE SERVICE, ITS SAFETY OR SECURITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE SECURITY OF YOUR DATA, OR THE SERVICE CONTENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE YELP ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT MIGHT ARISE, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM THE SERVICE’S INOPERABILITY, DEPLETION OF BATTERY POWER OR OTHER IMPAIRMENT OF DEVICES USED TO ACCESS THE SERVICE, SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY, SECURITY VULNERABILITIES OR FROM YOUR RELIANCE ON THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE BUSINESS LISTINGS, RATINGS, REVIEWS (INCLUDING THEIR CONTENT OR OMISSION OF CONTENT, ORDER, AND DISPLAY), METRICS OR OTHER CONTENT FOUND ON, USED ON, OR MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE.

13. **CHOICE OF LAW, BINDING ARBITRATION, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION**
    1. If you are a resident of the United States or Canada:
        1. **Choice of Law, Jurisdiction and Venue**. These Terms are to be governed by and interpreted under California law, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Both you and Yelp agree that all disputes that are not subject to mandatory arbitration as described in these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, these courts for the purpose of litigating any such disputes. 
        2. **Mutual Arbitration Agreement**. You and Yelp agree to the arbitration and dispute resolution terms in this Section (Section 13) (the “Arbitration Agreement”). We encourage you to carefully read these important terms, which include a requirement that claims arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, or your use of the Yelp Service, shall be brought individually and not on a class wide basis, and shall be subject to binding arbitration. You and Yelp agree to arbitrate all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, the Terms of Service, or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, except as otherwise provided in Section 13(A)(iii).  
            **This Arbitration Agreement supersedes any prior Arbitration Agreement entered by the parties and is applicable to unfiled claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before or after the existence of this Arbitration Agreement as well as to claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.  
            **
        3. **Claims Not Subject to Arbitration**. You and Yelp each retain the rights to: (i) have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction; (ii) have any claim, controversy, or cause of action arising from any act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution resolved in state or federal court; and (iii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect intellectual property rights (like patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights). 
        4. **Arbitration Rules and Forum.** This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and, notwithstanding the provision above with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. (“FAA”) will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If, for whatever reason, the FAA is inapplicable, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply. The arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider. The party seeking to arbitrate must forward their arbitration demand to the other party and file their arbitration demand with NAM. Disputes shall be subject to NAM’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at [https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), including the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (“NAM Rules”).  NAM’s rules are also available at [www.namadr.com](https://www.namadr.com/). If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, Yelp will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and Yelp agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. The parties further agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative, filing, or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Section 13(A)(ix)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. The parties may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person. The arbitrator(s) or the NAM Administrator (if a decision is needed prior to the appointment of the Arbitrator(s)) shall determine the actual location of the hearing. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to namarb@yelp.com. If you are a Yelp account holder, any demand filed by you initiating arbitration must include the primary email address associated with your Yelp account, as well as any profile associated with that Account that is controlled by you.
        5. **Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Information**.  Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms of Service. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper, including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms of Service.
        6. **Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver**. YOU AND YELP ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN SECTION 13(A)(ix): ANY ARBITRATION MUST BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN OUR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM.  NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT, ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IF AND ONLY IF YELP PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING. 
        7. **Jury Trial Waiver**. YOU AND YELP EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. 
        8. **Arbitrator’s Authority**.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable and whether a claim is subject to arbitration. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. Damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of the “Disclaimer and Limitations of Liability” section of these Terms as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may order the imposition of sanctions against one or more Parties, which may include, but are not limited to, assessment of arbitration fees and costs, attorneys’ fees, and/or any other costs resulting from the sanctionable conduct. Any judgment on the award(s) rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        9. **Batch Arbitration**. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 25 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Yelp within a 90 day period (a “Mass Filing”), the parties agree to: (1) administer the Mass Filing in batches of up to 10 claims per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 10 claims left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining claims), regardless of whether any such claims are originally processed as individual arbitrations; (2) the appointment of one arbitrator for each batch, provided that each individual claimant shall retain the opportunity to object to the appointed arbitrator in accordance with NAM Rules and applicable law; (3) accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (4) the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award, provided that the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to establish a process to address individual issues; (5) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Yelp and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a batch proceeding and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (6) make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of demands within 180-days, failing which any of the claimants or Yelp may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction (“Batch Arbitration”).You agree to cooperate in good faith with Yelp and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. To the extent the parties disagree on the utilization of Batch Arbitration or as to the process or procedure for batching, the arbitration provider may appoint a sole procedural arbitrator to determine the applicability and implementation of the Batch Arbitration process, in accordance with the arbitration provider’s rules. This provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly described in this provision. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.
        10. **Mediation Following First Batch Arbitration in a Mass Filing**.  The results of the first batch of demands in the Batch Arbitration will be given to a NAM mediator.  The NAM mediator will be selected from a group of 5 mediators initially proposed by NAM, with Yelp and the remaining claimants’ counsel each being able to strike one mediator and then rank the remaining mediators.  NAM will appoint the highest collectively ranked mediator.  The selected mediator will seek to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing.  After the results are provided to the mediator, Yelp, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands.  If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Yelp or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction.  Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days after the close of the Mediation Period.  If neither Yelp nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process.  Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.
        11. **Changes**.  Yelp will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any material changes to this “Binding Arbitration, Disputes, and Choice of Law” section. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Yelp provides notice and will apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Yelp changes this “Binding Arbitration, Disputes, and Choice of Law” section after the date you first accepted this Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Service 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.
    2. If you are a resident of a country located in the EEA or Switzerland, Irish law will govern these Terms, as well as any dispute that might arise between you and Yelp.
        1. You agree that any subpoena, third-party discovery request, or other third-party process directed to Yelp must issue from, or be domesticated by, the state or federal courts located within San Francisco County, California and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of each of these courts for any related proceedings. 
14. **TERMINATION**
    1. You may terminate the Terms at any time by closing your Account, discontinuing any access to or use of the Service, and providing Yelp with a notice of termination [here](http://www.yelp.com/contact?subtopic=close&topic=support). 
    2. We may close your Account, suspend your ability to use certain portions of the Service, terminate any license or permission granted to you hereunder, and/or ban you altogether from the Service for any or no reason, and without notice or liability of any kind. Any such action could prevent you from accessing your Account, the Service, Your Content, Service Content, or any other related information.
    3. In the event of any termination of these Terms, whether by you or us, Sections 1, 3,  5, 7–15 of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
15. **GENERAL TERMS**
    1. We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Service at our sole discretion, at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice or liability.
    2. Except as otherwise stated in Section 10 above, nothing herein is intended, nor will be deemed, to confer rights or remedies upon any third party.
    3. The Terms contain the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Service, and supersede any prior agreement between you and us on such subject matter. The parties acknowledge that no reliance is placed on any representation made but not expressly contained in these Terms.
    4. Any failure on Yelp’s part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. The Terms may not be waived, except pursuant to a writing executed by Yelp.
    5. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, then only that provision shall be modified to reflect the parties’ intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
    6. The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Yelp’s prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted assignment by you shall violate these Terms and be void.
    7. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, agency, special or fiduciary relationship exists between you and Yelp as a result of these Terms or your use of the Service. 
    8. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

**Additional Terms for Business Accounts** 
-------------------------------------------

**Last Updated on July 10, 2024.**

The following terms (“**Business Terms**”), in addition to the [Terms of Service](https://terms.yelp.com/tos/en_us/20240710_en_us/) above, govern your access to and use of your Business Account. In the event of any conflict between these Business Terms and the Terms of Service, the Business Terms apply. If you have purchased products or services from Yelp on behalf of your business (e.g., advertising or business tools), the terms of that purchase apply in the event of any conflict with these Business Terms. Capitalized words used but not defined in these Business Terms have the meanings described in the Terms of Service. By creating, accessing, or using your Business Account, you are agreeing to these Business Terms and concluding a legally binding contract with Yelp. You are not authorized to create, access, or use a Business Account if you do not agree to these Business Terms. 

**PLEASE READ THESE BUSINESS TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE**. 

In the event of any termination of these Business Terms, whether by you or us, these Business Terms in their entirety will continue in full force and effect.

        9. you understand and acknowledge that: (a) non-disparagement clauses in certain consumer contracts, such as clauses that seek to restrict or prohibit reviews (including provisions that penalize consumers for posting reviews) about your Business, are prohibited under California law (Cal. Civil Code § 1670.8) and under the federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (15 U.S. Code § 45b) and you will not include such clauses in your consumer contracts; and (b) you may not attempt to enforce any non-disparagement or ‘gag’ clause against a consumer under any circumstances whether or not such clauses are barred under applicable law; and

You understand and acknowledge that Yelp employs automated software in an effort to showcase the most reliable and useful reviews while displaying other reviews less prominently (**“Recommendation Software”**).

You understand and acknowledge that any purchase of advertising or other paid features from Yelp will not influence the Recommendation Software or otherwise allow or enable You, directly or indirectly, to alter reviews or impact whether, where, or how reviews appear on Yelp.

    **The federal Communications Decency Act ([47 U.S. Code § 230)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230) limits the liability of interactive computer services, like Yelp, for their role in publishing third-party Content, including consumer reviews. Additionally, anti-SLAPP laws, such as [Cal. Civ. Proc. Code  § 425.16](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/code-of-civil-procedure/ccp-sect-425-16.html) in California, may require you to pay Yelp’s attorneys’ fees if you attempt to impose such liability on Yelp through legal proceedings.
3. ****DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AND CHOICE OF LAW****FOR CLARITY, THIS SECTION GOVERNS ANY BUSINESS CLAIM BROUGHT BY YOU OR YELP. ANY CLAIM NOT SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION IS INSTEAD GOVERNED BY SECTION 13 OF THE TERMS.**  
    **
    
    This provision is subject to the California Arbitration Act. Except for Excluded Business Claims, any claim, controversy or cause of action arising out of or relating to: (a) these Terms, or the breach thereof; or (b) your access to or use of your Business Account and/or Business Site (each such controversy or claim, a “**Business** **Claim**”), shall be settled through final and binding Arbitration to be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) and governed by NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time such claim is filed. You agree that any Business Claim arises from a business transaction and shall not be governed by the NAM rules, forms, or fees applicable to consumer transactions. Any award of the arbitrator is final and binding. If you have a question about the arbitration process or to obtain a current copy of the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or fee schedule, NAM’s Commercial Dept. can be contacted at (800) 358-2550 or by NAM’s website at [www.namadr.com](https://www.namadr.com/). The arbitrator will not have the power to commit errors of law, and the award may be vacated or corrected through judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction under the California Arbitration Act for any such error. 
    
    “**Excluded Business Claims**” means any claim, controversy, or cause of action: (i) arising from any act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution; (ii) related to intellectual property (like patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); or (iii) arising from violations of Section 7 of the Terms of Service (Representations and Warranties) or Section 1 of the Business Terms (Requirements, Representations and Warranties).
    
    Business Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator with exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable and whether a claim is subject to arbitration. Arbitrations will be held in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose for themselves whether to appear in person, by phone, or through the submission of documents. The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. The prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees  Any judgment on the award(s) rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    
    NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, FOR ANY BUSINESS CLAIM THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION EXCLUDED BUSINESS CLAIMS, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS THE PLACE OF PERFORMANCE OF THESE BUSINESS TERMS.
    
    YOU AND YELP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN BUSINESS CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND YELP AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE BUSINESS CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IF A BUSINESS CLAIM IMPLICATES THIS SECTION, AND THIS SECTION IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE OR ILLEGAL BY A COURT, SUCH BUSINESS CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.
