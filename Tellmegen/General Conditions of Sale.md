tellmeGen™
----------

How to return a product:
------------------------

Whatever the reason, please notify us of your desire to return a product by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you wish to be reimbursed for your order, this will be done through the same means used for the payment of the initial order.

For a faster service, the items must be returned in their original packaging and, if possible, in the same box in which they were sent. If this is not possible, we would be grateful if you could pack the products in the best possible packaging in order to avoid any problems during the return.

A confirmation email will inform you of the reception of your package and the processing of your order.

Conditions for exchanges and returns:
-------------------------------------

The maximum period for requesting returns shall be 15 calendar days from the day of receipt of the order. After this period, tellmeGen will not accept returns.
For hygiene and health reasons, tellmeGen will not accept the return of used, opened or unsealed products. Neither will we accept products that have been damaged or damaged, without original packaging/box/case or that are missing any element or accessory.
For a return to be effective, the DNA kit must be returned to our facilities. Once the kit is received and checked by our team, we will proceed to refund the purchase amount applying a penalty of 50€ for handling and shipping costs.
In the case of kits purchased through an authorized retailer, you should consult the retailer's refund policy to determine if your kit is eligible for a refund.

Steps to follow for the returns:
--------------------------------

If you wish to return any product, please follow these instructions:

1\. Contact the customer service department by e-mail: [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

2\. Pack the product(s) under the same conditions as received.

3\. Once the products are received, tellmeGen staff will review them and if everything is correct, the amount will be refunded applying the penalty described above.

The refund of the amount of the returns will be made through the same channel that the customer selected as payment method at the time of placing the order.

Please note that you must keep the invoice of the order to manage any return or replacement.

Policy of replacement of defective products or in poor condition
----------------------------------------------------------------

For reasons beyond our control, it is possible to receive a product with a manufacturing defect or in poor condition. Please, as soon as you notice that the product has an anomaly, please contact our Customer Service Department and inform us of the incident. Once you contact us, we will indicate the procedure for the replacement of the defective product.

In the event that the reason for the return is because the product is damaged or has a manufacturing defect, tellmeGen will pay the return shipping costs.

We will not accept returns of products that have been opened or used, unless it is because they are damaged or defective. We will not accept returns of products that have been damaged or spoiled by the customer. You must send a photo showing that the product is defective due to a manufacturing defect. If the tellmeGen support team considers the product to be damaged by the customer, no refund will be given.

Please note that you must keep the invoice of the order to manage any return or replacement.

Returns due to transport damages.
---------------------------------

It is possible that the product may be damaged during handling or shipping. In order to identify possible transport damage, tellmeGen recommends its customers to check the package upon receipt in order to identify possible knocks or damage to the outside of the package.

In the event that the goods show obvious signs of transport damage, the customer has the right to refuse the goods upon receipt, informing the courier of the reason for non-acceptance. In case of acceptance of the package and the customer realizes it later, he must take photos of the package showing that the deterioration is a consequence of the transport.

Loss policy
-----------

If the kit does not arrive at destination within 15 calendar days of purchase, please contact our customer service ([\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) communicating the incident so that we can check with the transport company what has happened. Once we have confirmation from the transport company that the kit has not reached its destination, we will proceed to send a new kit at no cost to the customer. If you wish to return your order, please check our return policy.

Shipping Policy
---------------

Once the payment has been made, you will receive the package in 2 to 5 working days at the shipping address specified during the purchase of the kit. 

Then, you will have [to send the kit back](https://help.tellmegen.com/faq/to-start/sample-send-kit-tellmegen/?lang=en) to us with the sample included to proceed to its analysis. This shipment to our laboratories is free of charge, as long as the purchase is made from the same country. Otherwise, please contact our team at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Return policy for Raw Data
--------------------------

At tellmeGen you have the option to upload your Raw Data files from other companies such as 23andme, Ancestry and MyHeritage, to have access to the information that our company provides.

In case your file is not compatible with tellmeGen but you have already purchased the payment plan, please contact us by e-mail at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the following information:

1\. Your name

2\. The order number

You will be refunded within 24-48 hours using the same payment method.

For your file to be compatible with tellmeGen it must meet a number of requirements. [Click here](https://help.tellmegen.com/faq/your-results/which-raw-data-files-from-other-companies-are-compatible-with-tellmegen/?lang=en) to see them.

If the uploaded files meet these conditions we will not refund your money. Please note that in some situations we can provide you with the health data, but not the ancestry data (haplogroups). This is because sometimes the SNPs used by other companies are not sufficient to calculate these results. In that case, if the file has been compatible for the other results, no refund will be made.

#### Important information and limitations

\* **Genetic Vulnerability to Health Conditions and Inherited Conditions reports from tellmeGen** tellmeGen's Advanced Genetic Analysis includes vulnerability to health conditions and inherited conditions reports. Advanced genetic analysis uses qualitative genotyping to detect clinically relevant variants in genomic DNA from saliva to report genetic vulnerability and carrier status. The information although useful is not intended to diagnose any disease. Ethnicity may affect the relevance of each report and how genetic vulnerability results are interpreted. Each genetic vulnerability report describes whether a person has variants associated with an increased vulnerability to develop a disease, but does not describe the overall risk of developing the disease. The test is not intended to inform current health status or to make medical decisions, including medication or treatment. Reports of inherited conditions can determine whether a person is a carrier of a genetic variant, but not whether he or she has two copies of any genetic variant. These reports are not intended to inform about future risk of developing a disease, the health of the fetus, or the risk of disease in the newborn child. **Caveats and Limitations:** tellmeGen's Genetic Vulnerability Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 reports on 832 variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The report describes whether a person's genetic outcome is associated with an increased vulnerability to develop breast and ovarian cancer, and may be associated with an increased vulnerability to prostate, pancreatic, and other cancers. The variants included do not represent the totality of BRCA1/BRCA2 variants in people of most ethnicities. This report does not include variants in other genes related to hereditary cancers and the absence of variants does not rule out the presence of other genetic variants that may impact cancer risk. This report is for non-prescription information and provides genetic information to discuss with a healthcare professional. Results should be confirmed in a clinical setting before any medical action is taken. **tellmeGen Pharmacogenetics Reports** tellmeGen's Advanced Genetic Analysis uses qualitative genotyping to detect variants in several genes in adult genomic DNA from saliva to inform the processing of certain medications and facilitate discussions with a healthcare professional. It does not describe whether or not a person will respond to a specific drug. Our pharmacogenetics report provides information on variants associated with the metabolism of some drugs and on the potential effect of therapies with certain drugs. The results should be confirmed by an independent genetic test prescribed by your healthcare provider before taking any medical action.**Caution:** The information in the advanced test should not be used to start, stop or change any treatment and does not analyze all possible variants that may affect protein metabolism or function. The tellmeGen advanced genetic test is not a substitute for a visit with a healthcare professional. Changing your current treatment may lead to harmful side effects or reduce the expected benefits of your medication, so consult with your healthcare professional before taking any medical action.
