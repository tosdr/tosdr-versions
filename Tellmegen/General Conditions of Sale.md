Return policy
=============

tellmeGen™
----------

How to return a product:
------------------------

Whatever the reason, please notify us of your desire to return a product by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you wish to be reimbursed for your order, this will be done through the same means used for the payment of the initial order.

For a faster service, the items must be returned in their original packaging and, if possible, in the same box in which they were sent. If this is not possible, we would be grateful if you could pack the products in the best possible packaging in order to avoid any problems during the return.

A confirmation email will inform you of the reception of your package and the processing of your order.

Conditions for exchanges and returns:
-------------------------------------

The maximum period for requesting returns shall be 15 calendar days from the day of receipt of the order.
After this period, tellmeGen will not accept returns. For hygiene and health reasons, tellmeGen will not accept the return of used, opened or unsealed products. Nor will we accept products that have been damaged or damaged, without original packaging/box/case or that are missing any element or accessory.
For a return to be effective, the kit must be returned to our facilities. Once the kit is received and checked by our team, we will proceed to refund the amount of the purchase with a penalty of 50€ for handling and shipping costs.
For kits purchased through an authorized retailer, you should consult the retailer's refund policy to determine if your kit is eligible for a refund.

Steps to follow for the returns:
--------------------------------

If you wish to return any product, please follow these instructions:

1\. Contact the customer service department by e-mail: [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

2\. Pack the product(s) under the same conditions as received.

3\. Once the products are received, tellmeGen staff will review them and if everything is correct, the amount will be refunded applying the penalty described above.

The refund of the amount of the returns will be made through the same channel that the customer selected as payment method at the time of placing the order.

Please note that you must keep the invoice of the order to manage any return or replacement.

Policy of replacement of defective products or in poor condition
----------------------------------------------------------------

For reasons beyond our control, it is possible to receive a product with a manufacturing defect or in poor condition. Please, as soon as you notice that the product has an anomaly, please contact our Customer Service Department and inform us of the incident. Once you contact us, we will indicate the procedure for the replacement of the defective product.

In the event that the reason for the return is because the product is damaged or has a manufacturing defect, tellmeGen will pay the return shipping costs.

We will not accept returns of products that have been opened or used, unless it is because they are damaged or defective. We will not accept returns of products that have been damaged or spoiled by the customer. You must send a photo showing that the product is defective due to a manufacturing defect. If the tellmeGen support team considers the product to be damaged by the customer, no refund will be given.

Please note that you must keep the invoice of the order to manage any return or replacement.

Returns due to transport damages.
---------------------------------

It is possible that the product may be damaged during handling or shipping. In order to identify possible transport damage, tellmeGen recommends its customers to check the package upon receipt in order to identify possible knocks or damage to the outside of the package.

In the event that the goods show obvious signs of transport damage, the customer has the right to refuse the goods upon receipt, informing the courier of the reason for non-acceptance. In case of acceptance of the package and the customer realizes it later, he must take photos of the package showing that the deterioration is a consequence of the transport.

Loss policy
-----------

If the kit does not arrive at destination within 15 calendar days of purchase, please contact our customer service ([\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) communicating the incident so that we can check with the transport company what has happened. Once we have confirmation from the transport company that the kit has not reached its destination, we will proceed to send a new kit at no cost to the customer. If you wish to return your order, please check our return policy.

Shipping Policy
---------------

Once the payment has been made, you will receive the package in 2 to 5 working days at the shipping address specified during the purchase of the kit. 

Then, you will have [to send the kit back](https://help.tellmegen.com/faq/to-start/sample-send-kit-tellmegen/?lang=en) to us with the sample included to proceed to its analysis. This shipment to our laboratories is free of charge, as long as the purchase is made from the same country. Otherwise, please contact our team at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Return policy for Raw Data
--------------------------

At tellmeGen you have the option to upload your Raw Data files from other companies such as 23andme, Ancestry and MyHeritage, to have access to the information that our company provides.

In case your file is not compatible with tellmeGen but you have already purchased the payment plan, please contact us by e-mail at [\[email protected\]](https://www.tellmegen.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the following information:

1\. Your name

2\. The order number

You will be refunded within 24-48 hours using the same payment method.

For your file to be compatible with tellmeGen it must meet a number of requirements. [Click here](https://help.tellmegen.com/faq/your-results/which-raw-data-files-from-other-companies-are-compatible-with-tellmegen/?lang=en) to see them.

If the uploaded files meet these conditions we will not refund your money. Please note that in some situations we can provide you with the health data, but not the ancestry data (haplogroups). This is because sometimes the SNPs used by other companies are not sufficient to calculate these results. In that case, if the file has been compatible for the other results, no refund will be made.
