AllClear Identity Protection

_Last Updated:  August 2021_

This privacy policy (the “**Policy**”) applies to your visit to our websites at www.allclearid.com and portal.allclearid.com (the “**Site**”); your subscription to any of our services and the provision of the respective services (collectively, the “**Services**”); and any other means of communication between you and AllClear ID, Inc (“**we**”, “**us**”, and “**our**”).

The Policy explains the categories of personal information that we collect, the sources we collect it from, the purposes we collect it for, and the third parties we share it with, as well as your rights to be informed and to request deletion. We also explain how we use cookies, and the security practices we use to keep your information safe.

#### **Information Collected**

We collect Personal Information through the Site when you access the Site and/or register for Services. “Personal Information” is information that can be used, whether alone or in combination with other information, to identify you as an individual.

If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to use the Site, or to use any of our Services (except insofar as your custodial parent or legal guardian has enrolled you in Services we have designed for minors, and accesses them on your behalf). We do not knowingly solicit any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years old in a manner that is inconsistent withthe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) of the United States, then we will delete this Personal Information as soon as practicable.

In order to improve the user experience of this Site and to deliver our Services, we have collected the following categories of Personal Information about consumers in the preceding 12 months, and may collect these categories of Personal Information about you and/or your family member going forward in accordance with this Policy:

#### **Personal Information that you actively provide to us**

For these categories of Personal Information, you always make an active choice whether or not to provide the information requested, every time it is transmitted to us. These categories of Personal Information are not collected in an automated way from your device or provided to us by a third party. However, if you choose not to provide Personal Information that we request in these categories, there may be certain features of the Services or Site that you may  
not be able to register for or use, or that we cannot provide without the requested Personal Information.

* * _Registration Information_

You provide Registration Information when registering for our Services through the Site or on the phone. When registering for Services, the Personal Information you are requested to submit may include key identifying details such as your full name, residential address, Social Security number, gender, and date of birth; and contact details such as your telephone number and e-mail address. You may also be provided with or create a user name (account ID) for the Site that may be used to personally identify you when logging into the Site. If you are enrolling in monitoring of one or more payment cards, passports, and other types of information, you will be asked to provide the information necessary for monitoring (such as, ID or card numbers).

* * _Minor Child’s Registration Information_

You provide Minor Child’s Registration Information when enrolling your child in Services for minor children. For example, as a legal guardian, you may be requested to submit the child’s full name, Social Security number, gender, and date of birth in order to enroll that child in identity theft monitoring.

* * _Payment Information_

When you register for Services that require enrollment and payment through the Site or on the phone, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address, and other information related to the transaction (collectively, “Payment Information”) from you if our Services are being purchased by you and not by a Sponsor Company on your behalf. Our payment Service Provider(s) may also collect the Payment Information from you directly (through forms embedded in the Site that directly access the payment processor’s service) and/or store Payment Information for recurring billing where required for continued provision of our Services as requested by you.

* * _Investigative Background Information_

You provide us investigative background information (“Investigative Background Information”) in order for us to provide investigative Services to you, including investigating fraud or identity theft claims on your behalf. Under certain circumstances (for example, if your health insurance provider has suffered a data breach) this may include information that may be considered Protected Health Information (PHI) under the US Health Insurance Portability  
and Accountability Act (HIPAA), such as medical record numbers or health plan beneficiary numbers. Other types of information requested as Investigative Background Information may include employment-related information, such as the name of your employer; and information about your financial transaction history, such as whether you authorized certain financial transactions conducted in your name. From time to time, we may request other types of Personal Information as Investigative Background Information if we reasonably believe that it is required in order to complete an investigation that you have requested. You always have the right to decline to provide Investigative Background Information that we request, without affecting your continued enrollment in our Services, but we may be unable to resolve an investigation that you have requested if you choose not to provide Investigative Background Information that we need to resolve an investigation.

* * _Other Personal Details_

In addition to providing Registration Information, we may ask visitors to the Site to voluntarily input other Personal Information from time to time. For example, when you visit the Site, we may ask you to provide information about yourself for marketing purposes, such as your name, email address, employer, and country location. If as a Site visitor you provide elements of Personal Information for marketing purposes that are the same data you provide separately as Registration Information (for example, your name and email address), we will maintain records of these Other Personal Details separately from your Registration Information. You can request that we delete or stop using these Other Personal Details without affecting your Registration Information or use of our Services.

#### **Personal Information that we receive about you from third parties**

These categories of Personal Information include: details that we receive about you from third parties, in accordance with their own privacy policies and legal obligations, who wish to sponsor your use of our Services (“Sponsor Companies”); and details that we receive from third parties in order provide Services to you at your request.

* * _Monitoring Contact Details_

* * _Identity Theft Monitoring Events and Alerts_

If you enroll in our Services and opt into identity theft monitoring services for you or your child, we may obtain events and alerts related to the Registration Information or Minor Child’s Registration Information you provided, for the purpose of notifying you about related events and alerts. We receive this type of Personal Information from Service Providers who specialize in data breach and credit monitoring.

* * _Credit Monitoring and Fraud Alerts_

If you enroll in our Services and opt in to credit monitoring, we may obtain events and alerts related to your credit file, or related to other Registration Information you provided, for the purpose of notifying you about them. We receive this type of Personal Information from Service Providers who specialize in credit monitoring.

* * _Third-Party Investigations Responses_

When we provide Services to you, in the course of conducting investigations that you have authorized us to conduct into possible fraud or identity theft, at your request we may contact third parties, such as consumer reporting companies that provide credit reports. In these cases, we may receive Personal Information about you from these third parties in accordance with their own privacy policies and legal obligations. We will use such Personal Information only for the purposes of providing our Services to you.

#### **Security**

We use a wide range of advanced technologies for Internet and secure interactive voice security, including multi-band, multi-factor authentication; encryption of data transmitted via public networks; and encryption of stored data.

When you attempt to access secure areas of the Site or sign into the Services, we will authenticate your identity.

We protect your information over the Internet by using a secure web server, which allows your browser to interact with our web server via an encrypted session.

For access to the Site, we use a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and our server. The encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into ciphertext to safeguard your information as it is transmitted over the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination.

Certain Personal Information we collect is stored encrypted. In addition, the Site and the Services are hosted in an environment that employs firewall and other advanced technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders, as well as unauthorized insiders.

Accordingly, we assume no liability for or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, or corruption of any data or other information transmitted in connection with the Site and our Services. We further make no warranty and assume no liability regarding the availability, reliability, or suitability of any ISP or digital subscriber line services._

_We make no warranties as to the security of users’ data communications, or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to or monitor users’ computer(s) or online communications. You agree that we will not be liable for any such unauthorized access._

These linked websites are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked website, or any link contained in any linked website. We provide links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement by us of the linked website. If you provide any Personal Information through a third-party website, your transaction will occur on the third party’s website (not the Site) and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any third parties.
