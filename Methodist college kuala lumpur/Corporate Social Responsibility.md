4.0 POLICY STATEMENT



4.1 Absolute Prohibition



4.1.1 MCKL absolutely prohibits any form of corruption, dishonesty, bribery or fraudulent acts

or activities in the conduct of its business. Employees and other Associated Persons of

MCKL shall not participate in or be engaged in any fraudulent activities or acts of

dishonesty, corruption or bribery (whether as the party offering or giving, or as the party

soliciting or accepting any gratification), when conducting business for and on behalf of

MCKL.



4.1.2 All business activities and dealings of MCKL shall be conducted with utmost integrity and

transparency and shall follow the established policies and procedures of MCKL and

relevant laws, including the MACC Act and related legislations. In cases where there is any

discrepancy between specific laws and the principles contained in this Policy, the stricter

provision shall prevail.



4.1.3 If an Employee or Associated Person is uncertain whether any act or action will amount to

a corrupt act, it is his/her responsibility to seek advice or clarification from the Institution

through the available channels prior to proceeding.



4.1.4 All Employees and other Associated Persons are actively encouraged to report actual and

suspected incidents of corruption through the channels outlined in this Policy.



4.2 Consequences

Page 3 of 5



4.2.1 Fraud, bribery and corruption are serious offences under the laws of Malaysia, including

but not limited to the MACC Act, Penal Code, and the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-

Terrorism Financing Act 2001.



4.2.2 The law requires that acts of corruption be reported and failure to report a known act of

corruption is an offence. Employees and other Associated Persons in violation of this Policy

may therefore be subjected to criminal and civil liability.



4.2.3 At Institutional level, stern disciplinary action including dismissal will be taken against any

Employee who is found to have been involved in any act of corruption or dishonesty.



4.3 Gifts \& Hospitality



4.3.1 The area of gifts potentially exposes a party to the risk of bribery and other corrupt

practices. As such, MCKL has opted to practice a “No Gift Policy” to avoid any conflict of

interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.



4.3.2 Employees and other Associated Persons shall not directly or indirectly solicit for Gifts from

any party, whether for themselves or on behalf of MCKL.



4.3.3 Associated Persons shall not offer or give any Gifts whatsoever to MCKL Employees.



4.3.4 Employees shall not accept any Gifts from any party having dealings with MCKL in the

course of their duties. Employees are expected to politely decline Gifts and highlight

MCKL’s ‘No Gift Policy’ to such parties.



4.3.5 The term “Gift” shall be given the broadest meaning and shall include cash, services,

hospitality, sponsored travels or holidays, discounts, gifts for family, and any item in any

form whatsoever or of some value to the recipient, or which may give an appearance of

potential influence in decision-making or result in preferential treatment.



4.3.6 Corporate merchandises which are distributed generally (e.g., diaries, table calendars,

pens), or Gifts which are normal bona fide customary practices or hospitality between

businesses (e.g., a box of mandarin oranges, congratulatory flowers), forms an exception

to the ‘No Gift Policy’ and may be accepted but subject always to the guidelines outlined

below: -

• Of nominal value – The Gift must be of a type and value that is modest, appropriate,

and commensurate with the occasion and/or general business practice. As a broad

general guide, any Gift which is accepted in such circumstances should not exceed

RM300 in value;

• No obligation or expectation – It will not create any obligation or expectation on

the receiver or MCKL of a favour or advantage in return, or cause others to perceive

any improper influence;

• Right reason – The Gift is given as a common courtesy associated with a festive or

ceremonial occasion, or it is a bona fide act of appreciation or cultural business

etiquette or courtesy which is extended generally across businesses;

• Not in concealment – The Gift is received openly and duly recorded in MCKL’s Gift

Register; and

• Legality and Regulations – There must be no question that it is compliant with

Page 4 of 5



relevant laws and MCKL’s rules and practices.

Employees should seek clarification prior to accepting any Gift if there is any uncertainty.

External Associated Persons are encouraged to exercise prudent and sensible discernment

in relation to Gifts.



4.3.7 To promote transparency among Employees, a Gift Register will be maintained at the

Human Resources Department. Employees must declare and have recorded into the Gift

Register, within three (3) working days, any Gifts received in the course of their duties. This

can be made in-person at the Human Resources Department or by completion of a Gift

Register Form to be emailed with subject title “Gift Register” to: hr@mckl.edu.my.



4.3.8 Until otherwise communicated, all Gifts - irrespective of the value and circumstances of

the gifting (including Gifts with a value of RM300 or less) – are required to be declared and

registered into the Gift Register.



4.3.9 Management shall at all times have the discretion to redistribute any Gifts received to

charities, other external organisations, or among employees of MCKL.



4.3.10 Any Gift intended to be given to an external party on behalf of MCKL must be with prior

documented approval from an appropriate superior. The superior shall consult with the

Risk Management Committee if necessary. The purpose, value and approval for any such

Gifts must be recorded in the Gift Register prior to proceeding.



4.4 Other Associated Persons \& Third Parties



4.4.1 All dealings with any external party shall uphold MCKL’s values and standards of integrity

and must be performed in compliance with the law and MCKL’s policies and procedures.



4.4.2 Associated Persons including business partners, suppliers, consultants, contractors, and

other service providers of MCKL shall not engage in any dishonest or corrupt practices

when providing services to or on behalf of MCKL. Such parties are expected to comply with

all applicable anti-corruption laws, this Policy and relevant MCKL procedures.



4.4.3 Business partners, suppliers, consultants, contractors, and other service providers of MCKL

are independent contractors with no authority to bind MCKL to any purpose, or to hold

themselves out as agents or representatives of MCKL other than as specifically contracted.



4.4.4 Employees shall conduct proper due diligence prior to onboarding new business partners

and service providers and shall ensure that they are made aware of this Policy. Regular

reviews shall be done, and where breach, suspected breach or questionable integrity

should arise, appropriate and immediate action must be taken which may include

termination of services with immediate effect.



4.5 Government Agencies \& Public Officials



4.5.1 Employees must comply with all applicable laws and conduct themselves with integrity

whenever they deal with or otherwise engage with government agencies or departments,

regulatory bodies, statutory bodies, and any of its officials.



4.5.2 Employees are strictly prohibited from giving Gifts to government agencies and public

Page 5 of 5



officials to expedite dealings or in exchange for future benefits or results. Employees shall

instead strive to build fair, professional and transparent relationships with government

agencies and public officials.



4.6 Channel for Concern, Clarification or Complaint \& Whistleblowing



4.6.1 Should you suspect or reasonably believe that this Policy has been or is being contravened,

you have an obligation to immediately report your concerns. Failure to report any known

act of bribery is an offence under the MACC Act.



4.6.2 Any concerns or complaints which are raised or reported will be taken seriously and

treated with confidentiality. No person acting in good faith in making a legitimate report

will suffer adverse consequences. The complainant’s identity will be protected, and

assistance will be provided in the event that a statement is required by law to support any

investigation. MCKL will not tolerate any retaliation directed against anyone making

reports of (suspected) bribery or corruption. Appropriate action will be taken by the

Institution with care and sensitivity.



4.6.3 All concerns, clarification or complaints can be made or reported confidentially to the email
