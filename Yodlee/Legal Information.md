* **Cookies**
    * The Yodlee Services stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the Yodlee Services. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your Yodlee or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the Yodlee Services a better service for you. For example, we use this cookie to identify existing users of the Yodlee Services when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their Yodlee Services username (if desired) and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new users. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the Yodlee Services. We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.
