**Privacy Policy**

 Effective Date: April 1, 2024

Universal Music Group is the world leader in music-based entertainment. We are the home for music’s greatest artists, innovators, and entrepreneurs. As digital technology refashions the world, our unmatched commitment to lead by developing new services, platforms, and business models for the delivery of music and related content empowers innovators and allows new commercial and artistic opportunities to flourish.

As part of this mission, Universal Music Group operates websites, applications, stores, and other services (which we refer to in this privacy policy as "Apps") to help our artists stay connected with fans in new and exciting ways.

This privacy policy describes Universal Music Group's data practices, including the collection, use, and sharing of data through Apps that link to this privacy policy, along with the choices and rights you have to control those data practices.

**WHO WE ARE**

Apps that link to this privacy policy are operated by **Universal Music Investments, Inc.,** located at 2220 Colorado Ave, Santa Monica, CA 90404. As used in this policy, "UMG," "we," and "our" refers to this entity, who acts as a data controller and is responsible for the processing of personal data by the Apps under applicable privacy and data protection laws.

Other entities in the Universal Music Group family of companies may receive or process data in connection with the operation of the Apps, including **UMG Commercial Services, Inc.**, **UMG Recordings, Inc.**, and **UMG Recordings Services, Inc.**, each of which is also located at 2220 Colorado Ave, Santa Monica, CA 90404. Where applicable, each of these entities separately makes the disclosures in this privacy policy.

Apps may be operated on behalf of artists and/or partners who may process personal data in connection with the Apps. In such cases we will disclose the relevant third parties on the Apps and/or at the point of data collection.

UMG has certified to the United Stated Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles. More information about the Data Privacy Framework, including UMG’s certification, is available on the [Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program website](http://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Where we transfer personal information subject to the DPF to a third party, we require that third party to access, use, and disclose the personal information in compliance with the DPF. UMG is responsible for the processing of personal information we receive under the DPF and subsequently transfer to third parties acting as an agent on our behalf.  We remain liable if such third parties process personal information inconsistent with the DPF Principles unless we prove that UMG is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Any material changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted here. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.

**DIGITAL ADVERTISING**

We use third party partners to enable targeted advertising on third-party social media platforms, websites, and mobile apps. These companies collect information through our Apps to target users and serve ads. Some of these ads may be personalized, meaning that these ads are intended to be relevant to you based on information the companies collect or receive about your use of our App and third-party sites and apps over time, including through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.

Visit the DAA Webchoices tool at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) to learn more about targeted advertising and how to opt out of targeted advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool.

To opt-out of targeted advertising in mobile apps by companies participating in the DAA’s AppChoices program, you can download that app onto your device from [https://youradchoices.com/appchoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). You can also limit data collection and use by third parties for targeted advertising in your mobile device settings, where available. 

Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.

**COOKIES**

Our Apps use cookies and other similar technologies to improve your experience and support targeted advertising. For the purpose of this Cookies Policy, cookies, and other similar technologies (like scripts, plug-ins, tags, device fingerprints, Local Stored Objects, beacons, and pixels) are all referred to as “cookies.”
