Terms of Use for MaxRewards Mobile Application
----------------------------------------------

The MaxRewards mobile application (the “**App**”) is a copyrighted work belonging to MaxRewards, Inc.  (“**Company**”, “**us**”, “**our**”, and “**we**”).  Certain features of the App may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the App in connection with such features.  All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

These Terms of Use (these “**Terms**”) set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that govern the use of the App.  By downloading, installing, or using the App, or by clicking the “I agree” or similar icon, the user of the App (“**you**” or “**your**”) acknowledges and agree that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy, located at maxrewards.com (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent), and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into these Terms (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent).  You may not access or use the App or accept the Terms if you are not at least 18 years old.  If you do not agree to the Terms, you should not install or use the App or you should stop using the App and uninstall it.

This Agreement requires the use of arbitration (Section 17) on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.

We reserve the right to update and modify these Terms at any time, so please review them frequently either via the App or by visiting maxrewards.com.  Your continued use of the App will signify your acceptance of any changes to these Terms.

License.  Subject to these Terms, the Company grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, revocable limited license to use and access the App on any mobile device (“**Device**”) that you own or control.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any access to the App by automated inquiry devices, robots, or repetitive data gathering and extraction tools, routines, scripts, or other mechanisms with similar functionality, is expressly prohibited.
2. Certain Restrictions.  The rights granted to you in these Terms are subject to the following restrictions: you may not: (a) sublicense, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit or monetize the App, whether in whole or in part, or any content displayed on the App, or otherwise make the App available to any third party without our permission; (b) modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the App; (c) access the App in order to build a similar or competitive mobile application, website, product, or service; or (d) except as expressly stated herein, copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display, post or transmit in any form or by any means the App or any portion of the App.  Unless otherwise indicated, any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the App shall be subject to these Terms.  All copyright and other proprietary notices on the App (or on any content displayed on the App) must be retained on all copies thereof.
3. Modification.  We reserve the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (in whole or in part) with or without notice to you.  You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the App or any part thereof.
4. No Support or Maintenance.  You acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the App.
5. Ownership.  Excluding any Materials that you may provide (defined below), you acknowledge that all the intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, in the App and its content are owned by us or by our suppliers.  Neither these Terms (nor your access to the App) transfers to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such intellectual property rights, except for the limited access rights expressly set forth in Section 1.1.  We and our suppliers reserve all rights not granted in these Terms.  There are no implied licenses granted under these Terms.

3. **Accounts**.

1. Account Creation.  In order to use certain features of the App, you must register for an account (“**Account**”) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the account registration form.  You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information.  You may terminate your Account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the App.  We may also suspend or terminate your Account in accordance with these Terms.
2. Subscriptions.  It is free to register for an Account, however we also may offer additional premium subscriptions for you to purchase (a “**Subscription**”).  Details on the costs and the specific services provided with a particular Subscription will be found on the registration page for that Subscription.

1. We reserve the right to add or remove features or services from a particular Subscription, to add new premium Subscriptions or to stop providing a premium Subscription at any time in our sole discretion.  We will provide you notice if we do so.
2. So long as you maintain an active Subscription, we will continue to honor your then-current pricing for that Subscription.  However, if your Subscription ends for any reason, we will no longer honor the original pricing for that Subscription if you try to reinstate it or enter into a new Subscription, although we reserve the right to (but are not obligated to) evaluate the circumstances of the termination or cancellation of your Subscription and determine if we will honor the original pricing.  Subject to the foregoing, we may change the prices we charge for Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance.  To the extent any such price changes apply to your Subscription(s), those changes will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle for your Subscription following the date of the price change.  As permitted by local law, you accept any applicable new price by continuing to use the App after the price change takes effect.  If you do not agree with any price change that is applicable to you, you have the right to reject the change by canceling your Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
3. Subscriptions are automatically renewing and unless you cancel it, your Subscription will renew for the same time period at the same pricing as the current Subscription period, subject to the provisions of Section 2.2.2 above.  By purchasing a Subscription, you authorize us to charge you, and you agree to pay, on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or yearly) for the applicable Subscription charge, any and all taxes or possible transaction fees, and any other charges incurred in connection with your use of the Subscription.  To avoid charges for a new Subscription period, you must cancel the Subscription before the end of the then-current Subscription period in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 below or the instructions set forth in the App (if any).  If you cancel your Subscription, you may use your Subscription until the end of the period you last paid for, but you will not be eligible for a prorated refund and your Subscription will not be renewed when that period expires.

4. Account Responsibilities.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and access credentials (your “**Access Credentials**”) and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account.  Anyone with knowledge of, or access to, your Access Credentials or the security questions and responses associated with your Account can use that information to gain access to your Account.  You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security.  You are solely liable for any claims, damages, losses, costs or other liabilities resulting from or caused by any failure to keep your Access Credentials and responses confidential, whether such failure occurs with or without your knowledge or consent.  We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.  We reserve the right to take any action that we deem necessary to ensure the security of the App and your Account, including without limitation changing your password, terminating your Account, or requesting additional information to authorize activity on your Account.

Security Violations.  You are responsible for ensuring and maintaining security of your systems and the devices that connect to and use the App, including implementation of necessary patches and operating system updates.  You are not allowed to use the App to interfere with, gain unauthorized access to, or otherwise violate the security of our (or another party's) server, network, network access, personal computer or mobile devices, software or data, or other system.

19. **Proprietary Information**.  The App, the content and information therein, and all improvements, additions, derivatives, and other modifications thereto, and any information pertaining to the foregoing, are the exclusive property of the Company and/or its licensors and shall be considered and treated by you as the proprietary information of the Company (the “**Company Proprietary Information**”).  You acknowledge and agree that the Company is the owner of the Company Proprietary Information, and you agree that you have no right, title, or interest in any of the Company Proprietary Information except the right to use the App in accordance with and subject to this Agreement.  You agree not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, sell, or otherwise transfer or exploit the Company Proprietary Information, or any portion thereof, to any other person or entity or allow any other person or entity to use the Company Proprietary Information, or any portion thereof, without the prior written consent of the Company, which may be withheld in the Company’s sole discretion.  You further agree not to challenge or assist with or participate in any challenge, directly or indirectly, of the Company’s ownership of the Company Proprietary Information or any right, title, or interest therein or any portion thereof.
20. **Third-Party and Open-Source Components**.  We may include certain third-party software components and open source software components in or with the App that are subject to separate license agreements.  To the extent you are required to agree separately to those separate license agreements or where a third-party license or an open source license expressly supersedes these Terms, that third-party license or open source license, as applicable, shall instead govern your use of the included third-party component or open source components.
21. **Connection Requirements**.  You are responsible for providing and maintaining, at your own risk, option, and expense, any hardware, software, and communication lines required to access and use the App, and we reserve the right to change the access configuration of the App at any time without prior notice.

23. **Third Party Carriers and Costs**.  The App communicates via internet and/or cellular data service provided by independent carriers.  The internet or cellular data service provided by the independent carriers may fail or go off-line from time to time, and during any such outage the App will be unable to transmit and receive information.  We may not receive timely notice of the communications outage from the independent carriers.  We are not obligated to provide the App during any such outages.  Cellular networks and internet providers may be regulated by federal and state agencies and changes in rules and regulations may require us to modify or terminate the App.  You will be responsible for all data usage and other network usage fees charged by your cellular service carrier in connection with your use of the App.
24. **Additional Terms for Users of the Apple and Google Mobile Platforms**

3. The Mobile Platform is a third-party beneficiary of these Terms and may enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.  Subject to the rights of the Mobile Platform to enforce these Terms as a third-party beneficiary, a person who is not a party to these Terms has no right under any applicable law to enforce any term of these Terms.  Notwithstanding that any term of these Terms may be or become enforceable by the Mobile Platform or any other third party, these Terms or any of them may be varied, amended or modified or these Terms may be suspended, canceled or terminated by agreement in writing signed by or on behalf of the Company or these Terms may be rescinded (in each case), without the consent of the Mobile Platform or such other third party.

26. **Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver**.

1. Dispute Resolution.  Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.  It is part of your contract with the Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.  Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties’ dispute.  Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings.  The following procedures apply to all arbitration proceedings involving you and us.
2. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
3. Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution_._  Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“**Notice**”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 75 5th St NW, Ste 2210, Atlanta, GA 30308.  After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
4. Rules for Arbitration.  Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration before one arbitrator in Atlanta, Georgia, unless the parties agree to a different location.  The arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS's Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“**JAMS Rules**”).  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any arbitrability issues including any dispute over these Terms or this arbitration provision's scope, application, meaning, and enforceability.  The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court.  Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction.  This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.  If the request to proceed in small claims court is made before an arbitrator has been appointed, any open arbitration between the parties shall be administratively closed.  If an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall determine whether the dispute should remain in arbitration or instead be decided in small claims court.  Arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions only, unless either you or the Company invoke the right to an oral hearing before the arbitrator.
5. Time Limits.  If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.
6. Waiver of Jury Trial.  You and the Company expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  This means that if for any reason the Arbitration Agreement contained in Section 17 is not enforced or is found inapplicable, or either of us file the action in small claims court, our claims against each other will be resolved by a judge rather than a jury.
7. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
8. Confidentiality.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

28. **General**.

1. Export.  The App may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from the Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.
2. Disclosures.  The Company is located at the address in Section 18.6.  If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.
3. Electronic Communications.  The communications between you and the Company use electronic means, whether you use the App or send us emails, or whether the Company posts notices on the App or communicates with you via email.  For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from the Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that the Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in a hardcopy writing.  The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.
4. Entire Terms.  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the App.  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.  The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  The word “including” means “including without limitation”.  If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to the Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without the Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  The Company may freely assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
