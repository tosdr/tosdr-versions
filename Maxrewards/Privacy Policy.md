==============

Effective Date: August 29, 2020

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains MaxRewards, Inc.'s (“MaxRewards,” “we” “us” or “our”) privacy practices for any information we receive from the MaxRewards mobile application (the “App”), the website at maxrewards.co (the “Site”), any other web address or hyperlink that redirects to the Site, and any other webpage or application controlled by us that links to this Privacy Policy and describes the ways in which we use the information we receive from you. Certain portions of this Privacy Policy also apply to other information collected or maintained by MaxRewards, for example, under the “Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act” and “General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)” sections below.

By using the App, the Site or receiving any services of MaxRewards (the “Services”) you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, including having your Personal Information (as defined below) used in any of the ways described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site, the App or the Services. Please note, however, that if you don't provide us with your Personal Information, certain parts or features of the Site, App or Services may not function properly.

MaxRewards may update this Privacy Policy from time-to-time in our sole discretion by posting such revised Privacy Policy on the Site or within the App. Please note the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy set forth above. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes each time that you use the App, the Services or provide us information.

Use of the App or the Services by you following our posting of a new Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as modified and will apply to all information received after the Effective Date of the modification. In the event we materially change the way in which we use your Personal Information that we previously collected, we will provide you with notice and ask you to affirmatively accept the new uses. This Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the Terms and Conditions that apply with respect to your use of the App or Services.

If you are accessing the services while located in the European Union, you may have additional data privacy rights. Please review the “General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)” section below for more information.

Description of Our Business
---------------------------

MaxRewards provides solutions that allow you to manage your credit card accounts and maximize credit card rewards and savings. Downloading, installing or using the App, is included in the definition of “Services”.

### Collection and Use of Your Personal Information

We may require that you provide certain Personal Information through the App to create or register for a MaxRewards account (an “Account”). Information we collect when you register your Account may include your name, email address, and other information that identifies you or that, in combination with other information we hold, may reasonably be used to identify you (“Personal Information”).

We may also collect Personal Information you provide to us when you use the Services, or email or otherwise contact us. We may also use your Personal Information to contact you to further discuss the Services or any product offerings. You may choose to opt out of providing your Personal Information by not disclosing it to us or entering it when asked.

Processing Purposes
-------------------

MaxRewards may process the following types of Personal Information for the following lawful purposes and based upon the legal justification set forth in the parenthetical:

1. Information you provide to us about your credit card products or login information from your issuing bank used in connection with the App (CONSENT)

Any data provided to third parties is strictly for MaxRewards' internal business use.

Delivering Advertising

California Residents' Privacy Rights:
-------------------------------------

This section is applicable to residents of California. If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights described below. The following does not apply to individuals who do not live in California on a permanent basis.

If you are a California resident who has provided personal data to us for the purpose of establishing a business relationship for personal, family or household purposes (a “California Customer”), you may request information about whether we have disclosed your personal information to any third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if we have made such a disclosure, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, we are required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as the “Categories of Personal Information Collected,” above. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by mailing us at 75 5th St NW, Suite 2404, Atlanta, GA 30308 or emailing us at [support@maxrewards.com](mailto:support@maxrewards.com). Please note that we are only required to respond to two requests per California Customer each year.

### RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT

This section of our Privacy Policy provides California residents with a comprehensive description of MaxRewards's online and offline practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and the rights of California consumers regarding their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). This section applies to all California residents (but not including legal entities, such as companies). The section will not apply, however, if MaxRewards does not collect any personal information about you or if all the information we collect is exempt from the statute (for example, the CCPA does not protect information that is already protected by certain other privacy laws, and it does not protect information that is already publicly available). For purposes of this section regarding the rights of California residents, “personal information” does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the public from federal, state, or local government records; and the words “you” or “your” specifically refers to California Consumers.

#### 1\. You have a Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold.

You have the right to request that MaxRewards disclose what personal information we collect, use and disclose. This is called the “Right to Know”. Under the Right to Know, you can request a listing of the types of personal information we have collected about you, the sources of that information, how we use the information, other individuals and business with whom we share personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.

If you would like the above information, you may contact us through our webpage or customer service. When you make a request under your Right to Know, you can expect the following:

1. We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us the following information: email address and full name in order for us to verify that you are who you say you are.
2. We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.
3. We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, to process your request.
4. In certain cases, a Request to Know may be denied, for example, if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you the information could create an unreasonable risk to someone's security (for example, we do not want sensitive information disclosed inappropriately). If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it. If we deny a request, we will still try to provide you as much of the information as we can, but we will withhold the information subject to denial.

In the last 12 months, we have collected the categories of personal information described above under the section “Categories of Personal Information Collected.” All such information was collected from sources as described above and for the purposes described above. We only disclose such information to third parties as described in the section “Disclosures and Transfers of Personal Information”. MaxRewards does not sell personal information.

#### 2\. You have a Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information about You.

You have a right to request the deletion of your personal information collected or maintained by MaxRewards. You may request deletion of your personal information by contacting us through our webpage or customer service, as provided below, or by deleting or unregistering for the Services via the App. When you make a request for deletion, you can expect the following:

1. After you request deletion, you will need to confirm that you want your information deleted.
2. We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us the following information: email address and full name.
3. We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.
4. We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, to process your request.
5. In certain cases, a Request for Deletion may be denied, for example, if we cannot verify your identity, the law requires that we maintain the information, or if we need the information for internal purposes such as providing Services or completing an order. If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it.

Note that simply deleting the app from your mobile device may not result in the deletion of your personal information. \[Even if you request that your personal information be deleted, MaxRewards may retain certain information regarding how you use the App or the Services for our internal analytics purposes.\]

#### 3\. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information

You have a right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by businesses. MaxRewards does not sell your personal information and opt-out is not applicable.

#### 4\. Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer's Privacy Rights

You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. If you chose to exercise your rights under the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny goods or services.
* Charge different prices or rates for goods and services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.
* Provide a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
* In any other way, discriminate or attempt to discriminate against you for the exercise of your rights under the CCPA.

#### 5\. Authorized Agents

You may designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We will deny requests from agents that do not submit proof of authorization from you. To verify that an authorized agent has authority to act for you, we may require a copy of a power of attorney or require that you provide the authorized agent with written permission and verify your own identity with us.

#### 6\. Contact Information

To request additional information, or make any of the requests described above, you may contact us through our App or website.
