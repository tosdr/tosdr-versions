In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online software applications or downloading any of the Products and Services available on the Website, MyPlayCity may ask you to voluntarily supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, MyPlayCity may ask that you provide us personal information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains.

MyPlayCity is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website.Â  MyPlayCity will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our Website and the subsequent legislation adopted in the United States.

When you use the Website, MyPlayCity or third parties authorized by MyPlayCity may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and its Products and Services. When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to MyPlayCity every time you access content on one of our internet domains within the Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "_**Refer**_"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by MyPlayCity and used to help improve our offerings to you.

The MyPlayCity Website and any Products or Services available on that site are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply.

Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. MyPlayCity takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.
