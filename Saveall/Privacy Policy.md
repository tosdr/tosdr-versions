The technology used to collect information automatically from Gizmo Users may include the following:  

* Cookies: Like many websites, we and our and service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (e.g., to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (e.g., to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage, and web traffic routing on the Service). You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Service.
* Web Beacons: We and our service providers may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how Gizmo Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
* Embedded Scripts: We and our operational partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.

  
  

### Information Received from Third Parties

  
We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we and our partners, affiliates and service providers may use a variety of other technologies (such as tags) that collect statistical data relating to your Website activity for security and fraud detection purposes.  
  
You may choose to register to join Gizmo by logging into your account with a third-party via our Service (e.g., Google, Apple and other third-party services that let you sign in using your existing credentials with those services). Note that the information we collect from and through these third parties may depend on the privacy settings you have set with those third-parties and the permissions you grant to us in connection with linking your account with Gizmo.  
  

### Do Not Track Signal
