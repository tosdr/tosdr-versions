Surfshark Terms Of Service
==========================

Since nobody enjoys reading these things, we’re including short blurbs of text to help you understand what each section is about. You should still read the whole thing since this is only a comment and the Terms are the binding document you’re agreeing to if you have a Surfshark account. But we’re not judging.

Thank you for visiting Surfshark! Please read the following information carefully. PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE PROVISIONS COVERING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF SERVICES AND CHANGE OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of all Surfshark Services. This is a binding agreement. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Service indicate a person who created Surfshark account and/or whose payment method is charged.

We may change these Terms of Service from time to time. We will post a notice on the Surfshark Site any time these Terms of Service have been amended or updated. It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service periodically, and if at any time you find these Terms of Service unacceptable, you must immediately leave the Surfshark Site and cease all use of our Services.

When you agree to use our Services, which includes, but is not limited to: the use of our servers, routers, IP addresses, protocols, add-ons, software, applications, extensions, and other equipment, as well as any updates thereof, you agree to accept these Terms.

1\. What services does Surfshark provide?
-----------------------------------------

A VPN, plus a bunch of other services that all have to do with privacy and security.

Surfshark provides virtual private network (VPN) services, also other privacy and cyber security related services (“Services”). Services include, but are not limited to VPN and other software, extensions, applications, information and content made available to you by Surfshark. A VPN is a secure way to protect your online activities by encrypting your data connection. Thus, third parties are unable to monitor your network traffic, such as websites, downloaded files, or other used internet services. With Surfshark you can connect to different VPN servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of your location.

We don’t collect logs or any other information that’d let us identify you. The only things we do collect are strictly necessary to provide you with our services. If you are using the Dedicated IP service, your online activities could be traced back to your account information as this IP is tied to your email address. However, you may choose using an anonymous Dedicated IP option which will result in a removal of all the information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address. You can find more details about that in the Privacy Policy.

**No-logs Policy** is one of the most important features of our VPN service. It means your activities are not in any way logged, retained, or transferred to third parties when you connect to our VPN service. We do not collect any information about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic or any other similar data). We can ensure such policy as we are based in the jurisdiction, which does not require data storage or reporting, and processes related to provision of our VPN service are automated. Moreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by you is processed in order to provide VPN service to you. To prevent service abuse, our servers store your user ID and/or IP address, and connection time stamps, but this information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session.

Please note that if you use a dedicated IP address (a unique internet protocol address assigned exclusively to you), it will encrypt your internet traffic and hide your real IP address and virtual location. However, since it’s tied to your email address, certain online activities can be traced back to your account information as far as you don’t select an anonymous Dedicated IP option after the Dedicated IP installation process. Anonymous Dedicated IP option removes any information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address. Therefore, after you choose this, you will have to manually set up new devices and retain your own information as we will not have any links about who and how uses your Dedicated IP address.

More information on what information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our Privacy Policy at [**https://surfshark.com/privacy**](https://surfshark.com/privacy)

No shady stuff, please.

We do not approve any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities committed by using Surfshark Services. Surfshark will not be liable in any way or form for illegal actions done by you arising through or from the use of our Services.

2\. Do I have to create an account?
-----------------------------------

Yup. And you’re responsible for it.

In order to use some of the Surfshark Services, you will be asked to set up an account. You are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.

3\. What happens if I share or lose my account information?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Please take care of your information. If you tell us about losing it right away, we may be able to help you out.

If you open an account to use or access the Services, you must complete the registration process by providing the complete and accurate information requested on the registration form. You may be asked to provide an e-mail address and password. **You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password**. You may not sell, or trade that Account to any other person.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, e-mail address, or password. We are not liable for any loss that you or any third party incur as a result of someone else using your password, either with or without your knowledge. We reserve the right to terminate your account at any time.

4\. What is Surfshark payment, automatic renewal and refund policy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To keep you secured, Surfshark Services renew automatically. You can cancel automatic renewal at any time.

You can subscribe to Surfshark Services on a service period basis. After signing up for Surfshark Services you may choose a payment method. Only some of our Services are free of charge.

Paid Surfshark Services renew automatically at the end of each service period and your chosen payment method is charged again, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments before the automatic renewal. By entering your payment details you agree with the automatic renewal. We will inform you in advance by email about the automatic renewal of your subscription (if it is longer than one month).

Prior to the conclusion of your current subscription period, we may initiate a pre-authorization transaction on the credit card provided. A nominal amount may be temporarily charged to validate your payment method's status. Upon successful verification, this amount will be promptly reversed and will not reflect as a permanent transaction on your account. This practice helps ensure uninterrupted access to our services and confirms the ongoing validity of your payment method for future billing cycles.

We will send the first receipt for your purchased Services to your email. All later receipts will be sent to your Surfshark account (to see those receipts please log in to your account, click on “My account”, select “Subscriptions” and then see the receipts in the “Invoices & receipts” section).

Surfshark may change the price for the subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, or other subscription terms from time to time and will communicate any price or other changes to you in advance. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price and terms by continuing to use the Services after the changes take effect. Please see currently applicable recurring subscription fees [**here**](https://surfshark.com/terms-of-service/pricing).

We can refund you on the basis of our 30-day money-back guarantee. Except if you signed up via iTunes/App Store/Amazon, with a prepaid card/gift card or decided to use an anonymous Dedicated IP option, or have made any purchases associated with our Alternative ID service, such as the purchase of the Alternative Number feature. These are out of our hands.

Your satisfaction with our Services is our main goal. If you choose not to use our paid Services anymore, except for any services related to the Alternative ID and/or anonymous Dedicated IP which are non-refundable, we guarantee you a right to claim a refund within 30 days following your purchase of our Services. However, we would like to solve your issue before you decide to cancel the subscription, therefore you are always welcome to reach out to us at [**support@surfshark.com**](mailto:support@surfshark.com). You can get a refund for the cancellation of our Services twice. If you already have been granted a refund once, you can get the second refund if the period between both cancellations for which you claim refund is not less than 6 months. If you purchase our Services again after the second refund, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation. Monthly subscriptions may be refunded on the basis of the 30-day money-back guarantee only after the initial purchase. Once a monthly subscription is renewed, it cannot be refunded on the basis of the 30-day money-back guarantee. Surfshark reserves the right to verify the validity of your account information, and to withhold or delay any refunds until such verification is complete.

As a rule, you have no right to claim a refund after the period of 30 days from the purchase has passed. Nevertheless, in the exceptional cases, we will consider refund beyond such 30-days period, at our sole discretion, if you can demonstrate that the Services which you purchased were not available or usable and that you made reasonable attempts to contact us regarding this issue. In such a case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of Services’ fees paid during the subscription period when the Services were not available or usable.

We are not able to grant you a refund if you obtained your Surfshark subscription via resellers other than Paddle, Google Play, or Cleverbridge. In the scenarios when your subscription was purchased through a reseller other than Paddle, Google Play, or Cleverbridge, it is necessary for you to consult with the original seller to understand their specific refund procedures and potentially obtain your refund through them. However, if your purchase was made through Paddle, Google Play, or Cleverbridge, we can facilitate a refund for you in accordance with our policies. Please check with the individual reseller's terms for more information.

Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards are not refunded. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars is refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).

You have a right to delete your account at any time, however, deleted accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service period.

If you decide to use an anonymous Dedicated IP option which can be selected after the installation of your Dedicated IP, this will cause a removal of all the information we have in our database about your Dedicated IP address. Taking that into account, we will no longer be able to grant you a refund, as we will not have any possibility to establish any links between you and a particular Dedicated IP.

We reserve the right not to issue refund in the event of a breach of these Terms.

Any fees charged by Surfshark are exclusive of taxes. Nevertheless, we may calculate and add taxes or duties, including, but not limited to VAT, GST and other taxes or fees under laws applicable to you at the time of purchase.

All payments are being processed by our own payment processing companies (Surfshark Limited, registered at Suite 1, 3rd Floor 11-12 St. James’s Square, London, United Kingdom, SW1Y 4LB and Surfshark Inc., registered at 16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes, Delaware 19958, County of Sussex) with help of third-party providers (see our Privacy Policy).

Our Services (products) may be subject to the U.S. and European Union export and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR“) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce. You also warrant that you are (a) not located in any country to which the European Union, the United Kingdom, the U.S. or other relevant jurisdiction has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions, which would forbid or limit the use, import, export, sale of, or payment for the Services; and (b) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in relevant jurisdictions or otherwise listed on any list of prohibited or restricted parties as administered by the Office of Foreign Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC“), the U.S. Department of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, His Majesty's Treasury of the United Kingdom, or other relevant sanctions authority (“Sanctions Authorities”).

8\. What is Surfshark’s Fair Usage Policy?
------------------------------------------

Feel free to connect all of your devices, but don’t resell Surfshark or exploit our service. Not cool.

Surfshark is committed to provide the best possible experience of using the Services to all our users. This includes making sure that every user of our Services gets the full experience from their chosen plan. To deliver on this commitment, we have implemented an automated infrastructure maintenance system which continuously manages our network capacity.

Although one of the core premises of Surfshark is an unlimited number of simultaneous connections (except for Antivirus service), there might be some users who exploit it, and this might have an adverse effect on the quality of our Services as well as usage experience for the rest of our users. Such users can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized resellers, organizers of illicit activities which involve usage of a very large number of devices, and other.

Our Fair Usage Policy manages inappropriate use of our Services and guarantees that the Services can be used fairly by everyone. Under the Fair Usage Policy, we reserve the right to enable limits of an immoderate number of simultaneously connected devices in our network maintenance system in order to make sure that none of our users are affected by potentially deteriorated quality of the Services.

Surfshark Antivirus service allows a maximum of five simultaneous connections per account.

Surfshark Alternative ID service also stipulates specific usage limitations. To ensure only personal, safe and fair use, we reserve the right to limit the quantity of emails/messages sent via Alternative ID service, as well as the total number of generated outputs, email addresses, and phone numbers created by an individual user. Additionally, the service incorporates a solution that allows you to obtain an alternative telephone number ("Alternative Number"), thereby enabling you to privately receive calls and messages via our specialized software. This feature is tailored strictly to meet privacy and safety needs and is not intended for use in general social interactions. Considering these factors, Surfshark explicitly reserves the right to impose specific restrictions on the communication features provided, with the intention of reducing the risk of misuse of the Alternative Number feature and to ensure adherence to the prescribed uses as outlined by the service. The Alternative Number feature is not configured for, nor shall it support the use of, verification codes (one-time passcodes), and it inherently lacks the functionality to receive such codes.

9\. Does Surfshark link to any third party sites?
-------------------------------------------------

Yes. So, click all the links leading out of Surfshark responsibly.

Surfshark may link to or be linked from other websites that are not maintained by, or related to, Surfshark. Surfshark does not endorse, and is not responsible for, the content of any of those third-party websites. You acknowledge that Surfshark has not reviewed and does not endorse the content of all sites linked to from this Website and is not responsible for the content or actions of any other sites linked to from this Website. We do not promise that the contents of any linked sites are accurate, compliant with local, state or federal law, including any intellectual property laws. Your use of any linked site is at your own responsibility and you assume all responsibilities and consequences resulting from such reliance.

10\. Disclaimers and Limitations on Liability.
----------------------------------------------

We try to make sure everything’s always error-free, but to err is human. You agree not to hold any grudges about that.

SURFSHARK PROVIDES ITS WEBSITE AND SERVICES TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. Surfshark cannot guarantee that the Services or its content is error free and makes no representations about the technical accuracy or functionality of the Services or that the content is accurate, error free or up to date. Actual service coverage, speeds, locations and quality may vary. Your hereby expressly agree and acknowledge that Antivirus complies with the current industry standard of software technology and that it is impossible under any currently available technology for any application to identify and eliminate one hundred percent of all malware. Surfshark makes no representations – your use of the Services is your sole responsibility.

If you use the Alternative ID service, you recognize that there might be instances when due to external factors the delivery of emails to your alternative email address and receipt of the calls and messages to your alternative phone number may be interrupted. These impediments can arise from a host of issues, including but not limited to network disruptions, service outages, and spam filtering processes. In light of these potential challenges, Surfshark does not assert or guarantee the prompt and exact delivery or reception of communications. As such, Surfshark shall not be held accountable for any communication that is either missed, delayed, or undelivered.
