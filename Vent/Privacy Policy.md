At TalkLife, respect for your privacy is foundational to everything we do. Since we started TalkLife we have strived to build our Services with a strong set of privacy principles in mind.

This Privacy Policy describes how TalkLife collects, uses and discloses information in regards to Vent, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

Data may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for a third-party vendor.

How We Use Information
----------------------

We use the information we have (subject to choices you make) to operate, provide, improve, understand, customise, support and market our Services. Here’s how:

**Our Services.** We use the information we have to operate and provide our Services, including providing customer support, and improving, fixing and customising our services. We understand how people use our Services and analyse and use the information we have to evaluate and improve our Services, research, develop and test new services and features, and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond when you contact us.

**Safety And Security.** We verify accounts and activity, and promote safety and security on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms or Community Guidelines, and to ensure our Services are being used legally.

​Please also note that information we hold and information that you share may be passed to the appropriate authorities or regulators where: this is required or requested by the authorities or by law; we have concerns that any individual is likely to cause harm to themselves or other people; or there is an actual or suspected case of cyber bullying and we are requested by appropriate authorities to provide such information or cooperate with their investigation.

**​E-mail Marketing and Newsletters.** We may use your personal data from time to time to contact you (via electronic means) with our internal newsletters and details of new blog posts and other communications or services that we are available on our site or our app, where we think these may be of interest to you. Our emails will contain links which enable you to “unsubscribe” to such communications at any point. Our site and our app may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks and affiliates.  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

Information You And We Share
----------------------------

You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customise, support and market our services.

**Information You Share Socially.** Our sites and our app allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends. Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others.

For example: When you submit a post or comment to the Services, visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see the content of your posts and comments, the username associated with your posts or comments, and the date and time you originally submitted the post or comment. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., if content you have shared in a one-to-one conversation is shared by another member without your consent) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the services.

When users view your profile, they will be able to see information which you have made public such as your username, age, prior posts and comments, your biography information and how long you have been a member of the Services.

Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers. See “Managing and Deleting Your Information”.

**Analytics Partners**
----------------------

We may partner with third-party analytics providers to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyse usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyse and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.

**Assignment, Change Of Control, And Transfer**
-----------------------------------------------

All of our rights and obligations under our Privacy Policy are freely assignable by us to any of our affiliates, in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and we may transfer your information to any of our affiliates, successor entities, or new owner.

If TalkLife Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets; and If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation (including responding to requests from law enforcement authorities both inside and outside the EEA), or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction, and may require us to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA.

How the General Data Protection Regulation Applies To Our Users
---------------------------------------------------------------

The General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679 EU) (EU GDPR) is the governing legislation for collecting and processing personal data in the EU. Following the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, most of the EU GDPR was retained in UK law by the European Union  (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The retained GDPR is known as the “UK GDPR”. The UK GDPR is supplemented by the Data Protection Act 2018. As a UK based company, all TalkLife activities therefore comply with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

Our Legal Bases For Processing Information
------------------------------------------

We collect, use, and share the information we have described above:

* as necessary to fulfil our Terms;
* consistent with your consent, which you can revoke at any time;
* as necessary to comply with our legal obligations;
* occasionally to protect your vital interests, or those of others;
* as necessary in the public interest; and
* as necessary for our (or others’) legitimate interests, including our interests in providing an innovative, relevant, safe, and profitable service to our users and partners, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protection of personal data.

How You Exercise Your Rights
----------------------------

Under the UK GDPR or other applicable local laws, you have the right to access, rectify, port, erase your information and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. This includes the right to object to our processing of your information for direct marketing and the right to object to our processing of your information where we are performing a task in the public interest or pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party. You can request at any stage access to information we hold on your account by emailing dpo@talklife.co.You can access tools to rectify, update, and erase your information directly in-app as described in the Managing and Deleting Your Information section.

If we process your information based on our legitimate interests or those of a third party, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing, and we will cease processing your information, unless the processing is based on compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons. You can also object to our processing of your information. For marketing communications, we will always seek your opt in consent. Where we use your information for direct marketing for our own Services, you can always object and opt out of future marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications.

Managing And Deleting Your Information
--------------------------------------

We store information until it is no longer necessary to provide our services, or until your account is deleted, whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the information, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs.

If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your information, we allow you to do that through the following tools:

**Services Settings.** You can remove posts, comments and photos shared on Vent by using the deletion tool provided on each post, comment or photo. You can also remove posts via your profile and the Previous Posts feature. You can also use our block feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.

**Deleting Your Account.** You may delete your Vent account at any time (including if you want to revoke your consent to our use of your information) using our in-app delete account feature. When you delete your Vent account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Be mindful that if you only delete our Services from your device without using our in-app delete account feature, your information may be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of comments, posts or messages that you may have sent to them. We endeavour to remove your information from all of our servers within 14 days of deletion. If you sign into your Vent account at any stage during that period, your account will reactivate and you will need to use our in-app deletion tool again to remove your information.

You may also request the removal or rectification of your details by emailing TalkLife’s Data Protection Officer – dpo@talklife.co. Please note that we withhold the right to keep a record of any users that have previously been banned from our platform for breaking our terms and conditions if we deem them a future threat to other users.

Our Policies Concerning Minors
------------------------------

Therefore, individuals under the age of 16 may not create an account. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16 and if you are under this age you must not use our Services. Please take your privacy seriously and do not provide false information regarding your age when you register.

If we become aware that a Child has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to remove that Personal Information and to terminate the Child’s account.

Our Global Operations
---------------------

TalkLife shares information globally, both internally, and externally with our partners and with those you communicate with around the world in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Information controlled by TalkLife Limited is stored in the EU and may be transferred or transmitted to, or processed in the United Kingdom or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the Services set forth in our Terms and globally to operate and provide our Services to you. We utilise standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, and may rely on adequacy regulations (the UK equivalent to the European Commission’s adequacy decisions) about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the United Kingdom to the European Economic Area and other countries.

Changes to our Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

This privacy policy is reviewed annually. We will also occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy and the revised Privacy Policy will come into effect on the date it was posted to our site or our app or as otherwise notified by us. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by prominently posting notice of the changes on our sites and/or our app and, where appropriate, notifying you by email. We recommend that you check this page from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy.
