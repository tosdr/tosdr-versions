We take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely, including entering into appropriate data transfer agreements. We may also share personal data as set forth below:

1. by transfer to other Intertek Group companies where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which you have submitted the information; and
2. by transfer to third party agents and subcontractors which perform certain functions on our behalf, such as picking up and delivering samples, fulfilling inspection orders, sending email, removing repetitive information from client lists, analysing data and processing credit card payments. These parties only have access to such information as necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.

**10\. How long we keep your data?**

We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are available in our retention policy which is available on request. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.

**11\. What about changes to the Privacy Policy?**

We reserve the right to modify or add to this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice ("Updated Privacy Policy"). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Privacy Policy by posting it on the Platform so that it is accessible via a link on the homepage of the Platform, and that your use of the Platform after we have posted the Updated Privacy Policy (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy before using the Platform. The Updated Privacy Policy will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Privacy Policy and will apply to your use of the Platform from that point forward.
