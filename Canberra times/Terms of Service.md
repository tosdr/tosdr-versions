Conditions of use
=================

These terms and conditions, together with the ACM [Privacy Policy](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/privacy/) and any additional terms, conditions, notices and disclaimers displayed elsewhere on the ACM Network ("Conditions") govern your use of and access to the ACM Network.

We may change all or part of the Conditions at any time. If we do, the new Conditions will be posted on the ACM Network. Your subsequent or continued use of the ACM Network will constitute your acceptance of any changes. If you object to any changes to the Conditions, your only remedy is to immediately discontinue your use of the ACM Network.

These terms and conditions of use were last updated in November 2022.

#### The ACM Network

While we use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the ACM Network (of digital media assets and platforms operated of controlled by ACM entities) is available continuously, we do not make any representations or warranties that your access will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error free. Your access to the ACM Network may be suspended without notice in the case of system failure, maintenance or repair or any reason beyond our control.

Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Conditions, we reserve the right to change or discontinue any website, feature or service (or part thereof) on the ACM Network at any time.

Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Conditions, Digital Subscription Terms and Conditions or Newspaper Subscription Terms and Conditions, we reserve the right to change the pricing for any chargeable service or feature on the ACM Network at any time without providing notice to you.

#### Registration

To access or use certain parts of the ACM Network, you must register as a user of the ACM Network and/or a particular website that forms part of the ACM Network. Generally, registration is free.

When registering, you must provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date registration information, as requested. It is your responsibility to inform us of any changes to your registration information. We will treat your personal information strictly in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/privacy/).

You must not register multiple times.

You must not impersonate or create a registration for any person other than yourself.

We may at any time request a form of identification to verify your identity.

You must ensure the security and confidentiality of your registration details, including any username and/or password assigned to you. You are wholly responsible for all activities which occur under your registration details (including unauthorised use of your credit card). You must notify us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorised use of your registration details. You must not permit your registration details to be used by or transferred to any other person.

We reserve the right to, in our sole discretion, suspend or terminate your registration or access to all or any part of the ACM Network, including if we believe you are abusing the services in any way, have breached the Conditions or are no longer an active registered user.

#### Your Material

1. By uploading, transmitting, posting or otherwise making available any Material via the ACM Network, you:
    1. grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, licence to use, reproduce, edit and exploit the Material in any form and for any purpose;
    2. except where expressly stated otherwise, also grant each user of the ACM Network a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, licence to use, reproduce, edit and exploit the Material in any form for any purpose, subject to the Conditions;
    3. warrant that you have the right to grant the above mentioned licences;

* We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to:
    * review, modify, reformat, reject or remove any Material which you upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available (or attempt to upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available) that, in our opinion, violates the Conditions or otherwise has the potential to harm, endanger or violate the rights of any person; and
    * monitor use of the ACM Network, and store or disclose any information that we collect, including in order to investigate compliance with the Conditions or for the purposes of any police investigation or governmental request.

We are not responsible for, and accept no liability with respect to, any Material uploaded, posted, transmitted or otherwise made available on the ACM Network by any person other than us. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be taken to have uploaded, posted, transmitted or otherwise made Material available on the ACM Network simply by facilitating others to post, transmit or other make Material available. Furthermore, we do not endorse any opinion, advice or statement made by any person other than us.

#### Third party websites, advertising and activities

We may feature or display links and pointers to websites operated by third parties on the ACM Network. Such websites do not form part of the ACM Network and are not under our control. We do not accept any responsibility in connection with any such website. If you link to any such websites, you leave the ACM Network entirely at your own risk.

You must not link to the ACM Network from any other website (or otherwise authorise any other person to link from a third party website to the ACM Network) without our prior written consent.

The ACM Network may feature or display third party advertising. By featuring or displaying such advertising, we do not in any way represent that we recommend or endorse the relevant advertiser, its products or services.

No rights whatsoever in any content are granted to you by virtue of the sharing and embedding functions, and ACM reserves all rights in relation to the content and the Video Player, including the right to require users of the Video Player to remove shared or embedded content for any reason in our absolute discretion. Users of the Video Player must comply with any request to remove content in a timely way, but in any case within one business day of the request being made.

In no circumstances will we be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special and/or consequential losses or damages (including loss of profits, revenue, production, goodwill, data or opportunity) of whatever nature howsoever arising in connection with the ACM Network.
