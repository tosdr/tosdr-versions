IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer accessing the Site. Under certain circumstances, recipients, their legal representatives, and/ or law enforcement authorities may be able to combine this with information disclosed by ISPs to determine the source of a particular communication. By using this Site, you knowingly and voluntarily assume any risks associated with such disclosure. 

CREDIT CARD INFORMATION

If you make a purchase through our Site, we may collect contact information (such as name physical address, email address phone number), in connection with your purchase.  We do not process any underlying payment facilitated by the Site; payment is processed by our payment partners, currently we use Shopify and PayPal ("Payment Partners"). Credit Card information that you input to consummate a transaction is encrypted using SSL technology. Only the Payment Partners may be given access to the full credit card number that you provide. We do not have access to your full credit card number, although we may access or store the last four digits of the Credit Card number for record keeping purposes. Data handled by a Payment Partner is subject to that Payment Partner's terms and privacy policy.

DATA SECURITY

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.

DO NOT TRACK

Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.

THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES

Our Site may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our Site, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

The Site may include links to or integrate with social networking services. You understand that we do not control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate. While we may provide you with the ability to use such services in connection with our Site, we are doing so merely as an accommodation and, like you, are relying upon those third-party services to operate properly and fairly.

You should be aware that information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

EUROPEAN USERS

If you are an individual in the European Union, we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  The legal basis may depend on the type of information and how you use the Site.  If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose (for example if you make an order through the Site), you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer receiving communications or utilizing certain features on the Site.  We are not required to have a data protection officer, so any questions about our use of your personal data or related requests should be addressed to: [info@americanbubble.com](mailto:info@americanbubble.com)
