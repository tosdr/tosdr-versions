================

These terms and conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Website Operator ("Website Operator", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your"). This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the [minecraft.buzz](https://minecraft.buzz/) website and any of its products or services (collectively, "Website" or "Services").

Accounts and membership
-----------------------

You must be at least 13 years of age to use this Website. By using this Website and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at least 13 years of age. If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and use our Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.

We can not be held responsible for the content of the Minecraft Servers that are listed on the website. Users can freely submit servers to this list and the administration of Minecraft.Buzz is not able to verify the actual content on each server. If you should witness any immoral, illigal or bad behaviour on a Minecraft Server we have listed on the site, we urge you to report it to us using the [Contact Form](https://minecraft.buzz/contact).  
You are requested to act kindly when commenting or reviewing on this website. We exclude hatefull, racist, rude comments/reviews and commentators/reviewers.  
It is not allowed to try and vote more than once per day per server. If we spot deliberate cheating we might ban the user from the site. If it is many that attempt to cheat on a single server, a penalty may be given to the server at our discression.

User content
------------

We do not own any data, information or material ("Content") that you submit on the Website in the course of using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review Content on the Website submitted or created using our Services by you. Unless specifically permitted by you, your use of the Website does not grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable.

You agree to receive occasional e-mails from Minecraft.Buzz, all relevant to Minecraft, this site or your server.  
All servers listed on Minecraft.Buzz need to be free to play. You may accept donations, but requiring a payment to join or play is not allowed.  
We do not allow servers that are hosted on Aternos or Minehut, as that is usually an indicator of low quality.  
It is not allowed to advertise your server in the comments, blog, or reviews section on other servers on this site.  
You may only submit any particular server only once.  
You are requested to provide a minimum ammount of accurate information about your server. Servers with missing and/or inaccurate information may be disabled, removed, or banned at our discression.  
You are not allowed to use any kinds of scripts or macros to communicate with this site. For instance, scripts trying to vote automatically, edit or bump servers automatically. If we detect such activity you and your server will be removed and banned.  
Don't manipulate your server data to enhance players online value or other similar activity.  
If you find your servers getting deleted by us, it may be because you are breaking the rules somehow - work harder on your submission to avoid this. If this happends to much, we will end up blocking you from future advertisment on the website.  
Minecraft.buzz is an international website, thus your server MUST include an English description - It is ok to include a local language description below if the server it meant to target a specific nationality.  
Any kind of cheating or misusing of the website, can result in your server and your account getting deleted and/or banned. Cheating involves, amongst others, fake voting/reviews, commenting/server bumping without any new info, using wrong server categories, providing inaccurate or "spammy" descriptions etc.  
Our rop priority is providing users with Servers they'll want to play on. Therefore, servers and their staff acting in any kind of unkind/unfair way towards their players are not wanted on the website. We react on reports from users, and urge users to report any bad behaviour witnessed back to us, either by using the Contact form or e-mailing us.
