We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own cookies on your device(s). Please note that because of our use of cookies, the Services do not support the [“Do Not Track” setting](https://allaboutdnt.com/) available in some browsers. We use the following types of cookies:

* **Essential Cookies.** Essential cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.

They do this by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services.

Data Security and Retention
---------------------------

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request. Please note that we will not be able to delete messages or other content that you have sent to another Zulip user. If you request deletion of your account, all such messages and content will be associated with a “Deleted User.” In addition, please note that anyone that you send messages or other content to (or who may otherwise have access to such messages or content through a Zulip Organization or channel) may have downloaded or copied such messages or content.

### Exercising Your Rights

To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, which may include proof of ownership of the email address associated with your Zulip account, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request. We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request. You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:

* Email us at: [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com).

If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com). Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data.

        * Corresponding with you
        * Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms

### Sharing Personal Data

You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com). Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.

* **Access**: You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data. You can also access certain of your Personal Data by logging on to your account.

Please note that we will not be able to delete messages or other content that you have sent to another Zulip user.

Zulip will not be able to delete such downloaded or copied messages or content.
* **Withdrawal of Consent**: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.
* **Portability**: You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.

### Transfers of Personal Data

The Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Zulip and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Zulip in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Zulip to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do so, we will alert you to any such changes by placing a notice on the Zulip website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. We will generally aim to provide such notice about Privacy Policy changes at least 14 days in advance of the new Privacy Policy taking effect. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have come into effect, that means you agree to all of the changes.
