Terms of Service
================

**Effective date: February 7, 2022.** View [change history](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commits/main/templates/corporate/policies/terms.md).

Welcome to Zulip. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at:

* Email: [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com)
* Address: Kandra Labs Inc., 450 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94107

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and **KANDRA LABS, INC.** (“Zulip,” “we” and “us”). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the [Privacy Policy](https://zulipchat.com/policies/privacy), [Rules of Use](https://zulipchat.com/policies/rules), and, if applicable, [Data Processing Addendum](https://zulipchat.com/static/images/policies/Zulip-Data-Processing-Addendum.pdf).

**Please read these Terms carefully.** They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. **These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.**

**ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:** EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

Will these Terms ever change?
-----------------------------

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at [https://zulip.com/policies/terms](https://zulipchat.com/policies/terms), send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means. We will generally aim to provide such notice about changes to the Terms at least 14 days in advance of the new Terms taking effect.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

What about my privacy?
----------------------

Zulip takes the privacy of its users very seriously; see our [Privacy Policy](https://zulipchat.com/policies/privacy) for details.

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under thirteen (13) years of age and children below the minimum [minimum age of consent in their country](https://zulipchat.com/policies/age-of-consent); if you are a child under the age of thirteen (13) or below the minimum age of consent in your country, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under thirteen (13) years of age or below the minimum age of consent in their country, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under the age of thirteen (13) or below the minimum age of consent in their country may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com).

What are the basics of using Zulip?
-----------------------------------

To use some of the Services, you may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and display name (“Zulip Display Name”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your email address. You agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring that your registration information, including your email address, is accurate, complete and up to date. You may not select as your Zulip Display Name a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.

Additionally, you may be able to access certain parts or features of the Services by using your account credentials from third party services (“Third Party Accounts”), such as those offered by Google and Apple. By using the Services through a Third Party Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use by the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your privacy settings on your Third Party Account.

You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity or creating or administering an organization or group in use of the Services (each such organization, entity, or group, a “Zulip Organization”, and each administrator of a Zulip Organization, a “Zulip Organization Administrator”), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on such Zulip Organization’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that Zulip Organization).

You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.

You will not share your Zulip account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your Zulip account, your password, and any other access tools or credentials. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your Zulip account.

What about notifications?
-------------------------

As part of the Services, you may receive communications through the Services, including notifications that Zulip sends you (for example, via email or SMS). When signing up for the Services, you will receive a welcome notification and instructions on how to stop receiving notifications. **By signing up for the Services and providing us with your wireless number, you confirm that you want Zulip to send you information regarding your account or transactions with us, which may include Zulip using automated dialing technology to text you at the wireless number you provided, and you agree to receive communications from Zulip, and you represent and warrant that each person you register for the Services or for whom you provide a wireless phone number has consented to receive communications from Zulip.** You agree to indemnify and hold Zulip harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any breach of the foregoing on your part.

What are my rights in the Services?
-----------------------------------

The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (as defined below) and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you in a way that violates someone else’s (including Zulip's) rights.

Subject to these Terms, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to:

* Use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Services.
    
* Export Content via the official Zulip API and distribute such Content for legitimate purposes (e.g., a public archive or mirror which is approved by organization owners).
    

Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for any purpose other than using the Services is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us.

You understand that Zulip owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services. You will also not upload to, or transmit from, the Services any data, file, software, or link that contains or redirects to a virus, Trojan horse, worm, or other harmful component or a technology that unlawfully accesses or downloads content or information stored within the Services. The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content, but please remember that even where these functionalities exist, all the restrictions in this section still apply.

What about anything I contribute to the Services? Do I have to grant any licenses to Zulip or to other users?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Submissions

Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission”. Some User Submissions may be viewable by other users or by anyone on the Internet. You are solely responsible for all User Submissions you contribute to the Services. You represent that all User Submissions submitted are not false, deceptive, or misleading, and are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

### Licenses

Your User Submissions remain yours. These Terms don’t give us any ownership in your User Submissions, or any rights to them except the limited rights set forth below.

To provide the Services, we need your permission to do things like storing your User Submissions and showing them to the people you send messages to, or who otherwise have permission to see them (for example, any member of your Zulip Organization for a message you send to a public channel.) Our Services also provide you with features like sharing and searching. To provide these and other features, Zulip may access, use, store, copy, process, adapt, distribute, perform, export, and display your User Submissions. Note that the following licenses are subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://zulipchat.com/policies/privacy) to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.

You give us permission to do these things only as reasonably necessary (a) to deliver the Services; (b) to prevent or address service, security, support, abuse or technical issues; or (c) as required by law. This license is non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Submissions in connection with the Services and extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.

Other people may have access to your User Submissions through the Services, and you also give those people a non-exclusive, worldwide permission to do these things, only as permitted by the functionality of the Services and these Terms. For example:

* People you send a Zulip message to may view the message through the Services.
* Your Zulip Organization Administrators may [export the Zulip Organization’s data](https://zulipchat.com/help/export-your-organization) for archival or backup purposes, or to import the data into a self-hosted Zulip server.
* Messages on a web-public channel may be viewed by anyone on the Internet.

When you delete your Zulip account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions in association with your account, if applicable. You understand that User Submissions may still be viewable in association with a “deleted user” after you delete your Zulip account. You understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Zulip's records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.

We welcome feedback, but note that by sending any feedback, you grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works from, publish, distribute and sublicense any such feedback, and we may incorporate into our products and services any feedback, comments, or suggestions without any obligation or compensation to you.

Are there restrictions in how I can use the Services?
-----------------------------------------------------

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not provide or contribute anything, including any Content or User Submission, to the Services, or otherwise use or interact with the Services, in a manner that is not consistent with the [Zulip Rules of Use](https://zulipchat.com/policies/rules). A violation of any of the Zulip Rules of Use is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.

What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with the DMCA, we’ve adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

* **Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements**. If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to Zulip's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):
    * (a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;
    * (b) Identification of works or materials being infringed;
    * (c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that we are capable of finding and verifying its existence;
    * (d) Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;
    * (e) A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    * (f) A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
* **Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent**. Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:
    * (a) remove or disable access to the infringing material;
    * (b) notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and
    * (c) terminate such content provider's access to the Services if they are a repeat offender.
* **Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent**. If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
    * (a) A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;
    * (b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
    * (c) A statement under penalty of perjury that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and
    * (d) Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that the content provider consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that the content provider will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement or an agent of such person.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored 10 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's discretion.

Please contact Zulip's Designated Agent at the following address:

Kandra Labs, Inc.  
Attn: DMCA Designated Agent  
450 Townsend Street  
San Francisco, CA 94107

Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
---------------------------------------------------------

Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated, and you access all such information and Content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.

The Services may contain links or connections to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Zulip. When you access third-party websites or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Zulip is not responsible for such risks.

Zulip has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Zulip will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.

Your interactions with Zulip Organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Zulip shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Zulip is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Zulip, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

Will Zulip ever change the Services?
------------------------------------

We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

Do the Services cost anything?
------------------------------

The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.

* (a) **Paid Services**. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please see our Paid Services page: [https://zulip.com/plans/](https://zulip.com/plans/) for a description of the current Paid Services. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.
* (b) **Billing**. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. You can access Stripe’s Terms of Service at [https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal](https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal) and their Privacy Policy at [https://stripe.com/us/privacy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy). We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
* (c) **Payment Method**. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
* (d) **Recurring Billing**. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO YOUR [BILLING SETTINGS](https://zulipchat.com/billing/).
* (e) **Current Information Required**. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE IN YOUR [BILLING SETTINGS](https://zulipchat.com/billing/). IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
* (f) **Change in Amount Authorized**. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
* (g) **Auto-Renewal for Paid Services**. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your [billing settings](https://zulipchat.com/billing/), any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to your [billing settings](https://zulipchat.com/billing/). If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOUR [BILLING SETTINGS](https://zulipchat.com/billing/) OR TERMINATE YOUR ZULIP ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM. PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, ZULIP WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.
* (h) **Reaffirmation of Authorization**. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.
* (i) **Free Trials and Other Promotions**. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service may only be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com).

What if I want to stop using the Services?
------------------------------------------

You’re free to stop using the Services at any time by contacting us at [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com); please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://zulipchat.com/policies/privacy), as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

Zulip is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason at our sole discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Zulip has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Zulip or third parties.

If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.

What about Mobile Applications?
-------------------------------

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Play Store from Google (each an “App Store”). Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below. You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Service apply.

### I use the Zulip App available via the Apple App Store – should I know anything about that?

These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS applications (the “Application”) available via the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application:

* (a) Both you and Zulip acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and Zulip only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content;
* (b) The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, internal, personal use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;
* (c) You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;
* (d) You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;
* (e) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;
* (f) You acknowledge and agree that Zulip, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;
* (g) You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Zulip, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;
* (h) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;
* (i) Both you and Zulip acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and
* (j) Both you and Zulip acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

_Warranty Disclaimer._ Zulip and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (Zulip and all such parties together, the “Zulip Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the Zulip Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits, procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services. The Zulip Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services. THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY ZULIP (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

_Limitation of Liability_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE ZULIP PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO ZULIP IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

_Indemnity_. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold the Zulip Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.

_Assignment_. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Zulip's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

_Choice of Law_. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

_Arbitration Agreement._ Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Zulip and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Zulip. Both you and Zulip acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Zulip's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

* (a) _Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement_. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
    
* (b) _Costs of Arbitration_. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Zulip will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Zulip will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
    
* (c) _Small Claims Court; Infringement_. Either you or Zulip may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
    
* (d) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. YOU AND ZULIP WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Zulip are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Zulip over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND ZULIP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
    
* (e) _Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions_. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Zulip is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
    
* (f) _Opt-out_. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 450 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94107 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.
    
* (g) _Exclusive Venue_. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Zulip to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Zulip agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.
    
* (h) _Severability_. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Zulip.
    

_Miscellaneous_. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Zulip may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Zulip agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Zulip, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that neither these Terms nor your use of the Services makes you an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Zulip, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Zulip in any respect whatsoever.

Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Zulip agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
