If you sign up for an account on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms and enter into the Agreement on its behalf.

### 3\. Closing Your Account

You or forms.app may terminate the Agreement at any time and for any reason. You may do so by terminating your forms.app account or we may do so by giving notice to you that we are terminating the Agreement. We may suspend the Services to you at any time, with or without cause. We won’t refund or reimburse you in any situation. Usernames are unique and can only be used once.

### 4\. Changes

We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms on the Site or the App. Unless you terminate your account, the new Terms will be effective immediately upon posting on the effective date indicated in the new Terms, as applicable, and apply to any continued or new use of the Services. We may change the Services or any features of the Services at any time, and we may discontinue the Services or any features of the Services at any time.

### 5\. Account and Password

You’re responsible for keeping your account name and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any account that you have access to and any activity occurring in such an account (other than activity that forms.app is directly responsible for that isn’t performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized access or use of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only provide you with instructions on how to reset your password. We have the right to update any of your contact information in your account for billing purposes. In addition, you represent and warrant that all information you provide to us when you establish an account, and when you access and use the Services, is and will remain complete and accurate. We may contact you, or any seat, authorized user, or login added to your account, based on the information provided in your account.

### 6\. Use of the Account and the Services

* You could not use the Services in any manner by means of disturbing the public order, in violation with the general ethical rules, in the manner disturbing and abusing the others, for an illegal purpose and by means of violating the copyrights and intellectual rights of the others and could not present the Services received to the usage of the third-parties and could not make it subject for the commercial activities such as renting or presenting to sales. In addition to this, you could not perform activities (spam, virus, Trojan horse, etc) and transactions which prevent or make difficult the usage of the Services of the others.
* You are responsible for your content(in any form or response) and you must ensure that you have all the rights and permissions needed to use that content in connection with the Services. forms.app is not responsible for any actions you take with respect to your content, including sharing it publicly. Subject to applicable law, forms.app is not liable for your content, any other third-party content or materials, or any loss or damage resulting from your use of, or reliance on, such content or other third-party content or materials. You acknowledge that, to ensure compliance with legal obligations, forms.app may be required to review certain of your content submitted to the Services to determine whether it is illegal or whether it violates these Terms (such as when unlawful content is reported to us). We may also modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display your content that we believe violates the law or these Terms. In the event your content includes third-party brands, logos or other source identifiers, we may require you to submit a statement of non-affiliation before you may use such content in connection with the Services. However, forms.app otherwise has no obligation to monitor or review any content submitted to the Services.

### 7\. Account Disputes

We don’t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of your personal relationships. You won’t request access to or information about an account that’s not yours, and you’ll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who owns an account based on a number of factors, including the content in that account, and the contact and profile information listed for that account. In cases where differing contact and profile information is present or we are unable to reasonably determine ownership, we’ll require you to resolve the matter through proper channels outside of forms.app.

When a dispute is identified, we may suspend any account associated with the dispute, including disabling login and sending capabilities, to protect the security and privacy of the data held within the account until the dispute is properly resolved.

**III. Payment**

### 8\. Payment Plans

If you sign up for a payment plan, you will be required to self-select your package (Basic, Pro or Premium) (together, your"Payment Plan") from the options [posted](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/marketing/) on [https://forms.app/en/pricing](https://forms.app/en/pricing) page. Each Payment Plan offers different pricing and feature options and has varying usage limits. Once you select your Payment Plan, forms.app will never automatically upgrade or downgrade your Payment Plan. You will always have the option to upgrade to a higher tier at any time. If you sign up for a Monthly Payment Plan and if you upgrade during a billing cycle, your monthly charge for that billing cycle will be calculated based on the number of days in that billing cycle during which you were at each of the lower tier and the higher tier (including any applicable additional charges for the higher tier). You will also have the option to downgrade to a lower tier at any time, but if you elect to downgrade during a billing cycle, your downgrade will not be effective until the end of that billing cycle, and you will still be charged for that entire billing cycle at the higher tier (including any applicable additional charges for the higher tier).

When you sign up for a Monthly Payment Plan, you agree to monthly recurring billing, starting on the date you sign up. Billing occurs on the same day each month, based on the date that you first started paying for any recurring monthly plan. Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day you made your first monthly payment. If any part of a month is included in the Terms, then payment is required for the full month. Billing for Payment Plans may be paused, and you may choose to close or downgrade your account permanently at any time.

### 27\. Severability

If it turns out that a section of these Terms isn’t enforceable, then that section will be removed or edited as little as required, and the rest of the Agreement will still be valid.

### 28\. Interpretation

The headers and sidebar text are provided only to make these Terms easier to read and understand. The fact that we wrote these Terms won’t affect the way the Agreement is interpreted.

### 29\. No Changes in Terms at Request of Member

### 30\. Notices

Any notice to you will be effective when we send it to the last email or physical address you gave us or when posted on our Site or App. Please note that, for purposes of providing notice, we may use any email or physical address within your account, including contact information associated with an account’s primary contact, billing contact, owner profile, or any other profile or seat associated with the account. Any notice to us will be effective when delivered to us along with a copy to our address: Lasnamäe tn 4b-26, 11412 Harju, Tallinn / Estonia, or any addresses as we may later post on the Site or the App.
