The information generated by the cookie about your use of a Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by these service providers servers, which may be located in the United States or other regions. They will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of a Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. They may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf.

You may refuse and block the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Sites and it might impact your overall experience.

Q: The [Internet Society Privacy Statement](https://www.internetsociety.org/privacy-policy/) says that the Internet Society allows the collection of some Technical Information of both Visitors and Members who use the Sites. What third parties does the Internet Society use for this data collection?

A:  Our current services and/or vendors are:

* New Relic – a service that helps us understand the performance of our site so that we can improve the speed of delivering content
* WordPress Stats – a secondary statistics service attached to our content management system, WordPress.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If a page contains embedded content from another site, such as YouTube or Twitter, there may be additional data collected by those services. We strive to embed that content using the most private mechanism provided by the service, but in some cases data is still collected by the service.
