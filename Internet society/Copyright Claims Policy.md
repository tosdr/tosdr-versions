Digital Millennium Copyright Act – Copyright Complaints
-------------------------------------------------------

The Internet Society and the Internet Society Foundation (collectively, “ISOC”) respect the intellectual property rights of others and requires those that use our website to do the same. ISOC may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, remove or disable access to material on the websites that infringes upon the copyright rights of others. ISOC also may, at our discretion, remove or disable links or references to an online location that contains infringing material or infringing activity. In the event that any users of the websites repeatedly infringe on others’ copyrights, ISOC may, in our sole discretion, terminate those individuals’ rights to use the websites.    
  
If you believe that any copyrighted work is accessible through the ISOC websites in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify ISOC by providing our designated copyright agent with the following information:

* The physical or electronic signature of either the copyright owner or of a person authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.
* A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, and a description of the activity that you claim to be infringing.
* Identification of the URL or other specific location on the ISOC websites where the material or activity you claim to be infringing is located or is occurring.  You must include enough information to allow us to locate the material or the activity.
* Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.
* A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that (i) the information you have provided is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and (ii) you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials is not authorized by the copyright owner, any agent of the copyright owner, or the law.

Please note that the United States Copyright Act prohibits the submission of a false or materially misleading copyright notice or counter-notice (discussed below), and any such submission may result in liabilities, including perjury.  U.S. federal courts have determined that copyright owners must consider whether the work in question qualifies as a “fair use” before submitting a notice of claimed infringement.

You can contact our designated agent through [\[email protected\]](https://www.internetsociety.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against, you can send ISOC a counter-notice that includes:

* Your name and address, and telephone number.
* The source address of the removed content.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the ISOC websites may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint.
