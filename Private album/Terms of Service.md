6. Fees and Purchase Terms.

6.1 General Purpose of Terms: Sale of Service, not

Software.



The purpose of the Terms is for you to secure access to the

Services. All fees set forth within and paid by you under the

Terms shall be considered solely in furtherance of this

purpose. In no way are these fees paid considered

payment for the sale, license, or use of Cuntu’s Software or

Application, and, furthermore, any use of Cuntu’s Software

or Application by you in furtherance of the Terms will be

considered merely in support of the purpose of the Terms.



6.2 Payment.



You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in

accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in

effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Cuntu

collects payments through a limited number of payment

services (“Payment Provider”). You must provide Cuntu

with valid account information for the respective chosen

Payment Provider. Your Payment Provider agreement

governs your use of the designated credit card or other

payment method, and you must refer to that agreement and

not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By

providing Cuntu with your payment information, you agree

that Cuntu is authorized to immediately invoice your

Account for all fees and charges due and payable to Cuntu

hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is

required. You agree to immediately notify Cuntu of any

change in payment credentials for payment hereunder.

Cuntu reserves the right at any time to change its prices

and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on

the Website.



6.3 Service Subscription Fees.



You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for

any Services (each, a “Service Subscription Fee”) at the

time you create your Account and select the term of your

subscription (each, a “Service Commencement Dat”).

Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are

non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and

Cuntu for the Services until Cuntu or the Payment Provider,

for example Apple or Google, accepts your order by a

confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other

appropriate means of communication.



6.4 Taxes.



Cuntu’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any

Service, or payments for any Service, are subject to Sales

Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the

applicable Sales Tax to Cuntu, you will be responsible for

the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or

interest to the relevant tax authority and you will indemnify

Cuntu for any liability or expense we may incur in

connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you

will provide us with official receipts issued by the

appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence that

you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this

section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and

any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that Cuntu its

permitted to pass to its customers that is the functional

equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing

jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.



6.5 Automatic Renewal.



Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated

in accordance with the Terms. After your initial

subscription period, and again after any subsequent

subscription period, your subscription will

automatically commence on the first day following the

end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement

Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period,

at Cuntu’s then-current price for such subscription. You

agree that your Account will be subject to this

automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your

subscription at least 24 hours prior to the Renewal

Commencement Date by logging into and going to the

“Manage App Subscriptions” page in the Apple App

Store or the “My Apps” page in the Google Play Store

app. The same page will permit you to change your

Account settings if you do not wish your subscription

to renew automatically, or if you want to change or

terminate your subscription.If you cancel your

subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of

your then-current subscription term; your subscription will

not be renewed after your then-current term expires.

However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of

any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then- current

subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Cuntu to

charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the

beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon

renewal of your subscription, if Cuntu does not receive

payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay

all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii)

you agree that Cuntu may either terminate or suspend your

subscription and continue to attempt to charge your

Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of

payment, your Account will be re-activated and for

purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription

commitment period will begin as of the day payment was

received).
