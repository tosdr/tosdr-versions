**Order Cancellations**

Your order can be cancelled as long as your order status is still processing or on hold. You can cancel within 24 hours from the time you placed your order. To do so, login to your account, view your order and click ‘cancel order’. Your order will be cancelled and a full refund will be issued and you will receive a cancellation confirmation email.  
Please allow 5-10 business days for your refund to be credited to your account. 

Alternatively, you may send an email to info@privealliance.com with your order number and request to cancel your order.

**Returns**

Once an item of merchandise is delivered to you, you can return that item within 30 days of delivery. Items must be unworn with tags attached and in its original plastic packaging. Shipping fees are non-refundable. Please see our fit guide before purchasing. Items sent back that are eligible for return must be and should be sent prepaid via courier. We will not accept CODs. Packages should be returned via traceable carrier and insured to the full amount of the merchandise. We are not responsible for missing packages. Please take note that the returned item(s) may be subject to duties and/or taxes when it reaches our warehouse location. In the event that duties and/or taxes have incurred, said charges will be deducted from the item(s) refund.

**Markdown or SALE Items**

If you wish to return a marked down item(s) from your order, a store credit equivalent to the value of your purchase will be issued. No refund will be issued to the original method of payment.

**Return Process:**

1. Please download our return form [HERE](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/0417/5173/files/ReturnExchange-Form.pdf?v=1654746755)[.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/0417/5173/files/ReturnExchange-Form.pdf?v=1654746755) You will need to include this form in your return package.
2. Place the items you wish to return in the original packaging with the invoice and return form provided.
3. Ensure your parcel is securely packaged, wrapped, and reinforced
4. All return shipping is paid for by the customer. Please make sure to retain tracking # and insurance as Privé Alliance is not responsible for any lost packages during shipping.
5. Address return package to: 56C 12th St. New Manila, Quezon City, Corner Gilmore St., Brgy Mariana 1112

For items that are manufactured by another party and resold by us, please do not send such items back to the manufacturer.  
  
\*\*Note: We’re not able to offer an exchange on returned items. If you need to change your size or color, the return process above will need to be followed and a new order will have to be made through our website. Orders will be subject to the stock quantity currently on the site.

**Return Processing Time**

All returns are processed within 5-10 business days after receiving the return package. Refunds will be credited either as a Store Credit or to the original payment method. There is an additional 5-10 business days for refunds to be processed back to the same method of payment, depending on your bank. Whereas, store credit refunds will be available immediately. Please [](https://online-store-web.shopifyapps.com/pages/contact-us)[contact us](https://privealliance.com/pages/contact-us) for your preferred refund method.

**Damaged Goods and Wrong Item(s) received**

In cases in which you received the wrong item(s) or if the item(s) is in damaged condition, please email us within 15 days of the delivery date at [info@privealliance.com](mailto:info@privealliance.com) and we will look into the situation accordingly. We will request for a proof of the damaged goods or the wrong item(s) received and we will offer a refund, which could be full or partial, depending on our assessment. Refunds will be credited either as a store credit or to the original payment method. In the event that the item(s) is eligible for a replacement, it is our right to request for a photo of the item(s) cut in half with the invoice and a handwritten order number before we send the replacement. This is an effort to cut down on frauds. Complaints filed 15 - 30 days after the date of delivery will still be eligible for a full or partial store credit refund.

**Store Credits**

Store credits will be issued via email in the form of a gift card. If you wish to redeem your store credit, you will need to use the code provided in the store credit email. Also, the store credits will automatically be applied as the first method of payment. The remaining balance can be paid by credit or debit card, PayPal, or Alipay + global partners. Store credits are not redeemable or exchangeable for cash. 

**Unclaimed Shipment**

If you refuse, do not claim a package or if a package is returned due to an incorrect delivery address, you will be responsible for the original delivery charges and be charged the fee to ship the package back to us as well as any duties charged to us. For orders that received Free Shipping, the original shipping savings associated with the returned item(s) will be deducted from the refund amount unless the return was due to our error. Refunds will be credited either as a store credit or to the original payment method.
