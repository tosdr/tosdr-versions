4.1. To use the Service you have to register and create a service account (“**Account**”). You can create multiple sub-accounts under the Account. When registering to the Service, and at any time during the term of the Agreement, you must provide true, accurate and complete information as required by UpCloud, and keep your information up-to-date.

You will be responsible for the payment of all service fees based on the Orders made under your Account. Orders will be valid only after being accepted by UpCloud. UpCloud will be deemed to have accepted the Order if UpCloud supplies the ordered Service. We reserve the right to limit or restrict your ability to place Orders.

4.3. You will be liable for all activities conducted in the Service under your Account, including any actions taken by the Users. You must comply, and you must ensure that the Users comply, with the AUP and all user instructions relating to the Service.

4.4. You must safeguard, and ensure that any Users safeguard, the usernames and passwords of your Account. You must promptly inform us if you suspect that an unauthorised third party is using, or may have an access to, the Service or your Account.

#### 6\. Provision of the Service, Service Levels, Warranties

6.1. We will perform the Service in accordance with these Terms with commercially reasonable care and skill and in all material respects as described in the Service Descriptions.

6.2. If you consider that the Service provided to you was not performed as described in the relevant Service Description, you must promptly provide us with a written notice that describes the deficiency in the Service.

In all other respects the Service is provided on “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and UpCloud will not give the Customer any warranty or guarantee, express or implied, for the Service, its merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, performance, or non-infringement. The Service is not designed to be error-free or uninterrupted and therefore it is neither intended nor fit for purposes that require fail-safe performance. The remedies set forth in this Section 6 will be your sole and exclusive remedies for any defects, deficiencies or interruptions in the Service.

We will provide technical support for your dedicated administrative Users, as described in the Support Service Description, which includes the Support Team’s contact details and service hours.

#### 8\. Third-Party Products

We do not assume any liability with regard to Third-Party Products or their use, whether or not they are linked to the Service.

#### 9\. Changes to the Service

9.1. UpCloud is entitled to develop its services and business offerings.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient amount of Credits deposited on your Account at all times to cover the service fees associated with the Service you have subscribed for.

If you do not remedy the negative or zero balance and deposit Credits to your Account within a reasonable time determined by UpCloud (at a minimum fourteen (14) days), we will consider the Agreement terminated and will close your Account and delete all the Customer Data thereunder. You are obliged to pay applicable service fees (e.g. for storage and IP addresses) even during the suspension until the Agreement is terminated.

#### 12\. Free Trials

12.1. We may from time to time offer trials of the Service for a specified period without payment obligation by offering you free-of-charge Credits or by way of a money-back guarantee (“**Free Trial**”). The features of the Service may be limited during the Free Trial.

12.2. We may require you to provide payment details to start the Free Trial. After the expiry of the Free Trial, we have the right to start charging for the Service the applicable service fees in accordance with Section 11 above and according to the currently valid public price list.

#### 13\. Illegal Content, Suspensions, Termination

#### 14\. Use Restrictions

(i) modify the Service or any part of it to eliminate the infringement in such a manner that the modified Service complies with the Agreement; or

#### 16\. Customer Data

16.1. As between UpCloud and the Customer, the Customer retains all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data. You grant UpCloud the right to host, use, process, display and transmit Customer Data to provide the Service in accordance with the Agreement. You have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of Customer Data, and for obtaining necessary rights and consents related to Customer Data to allow UpCloud to perform the Service. If you do not have necessary rights or consents related to the Customer Data, you are not allowed to upload or store such Customer Data in the Service. Within a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of the Agreement, or after you have permanently ceased using the Services, UpCloud will delete all Customer Data under your Account, unless UpCloud is obliged to retain copies of the Customer Data pursuant to applicable laws or orders of Governmental Authority.

16.2. If the Customer Data contains personal data, the provisions of the DPA shall govern the processing of that personal data by UpCloud.  With the exception of obligations relating to the personal data set forth in the DPA, we do not assume any liability with respect to the Customer Data, nor do we endorse any opinion contained in the Customer Data.

16.3. You must ensure that the Customer Data does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights or violate any applicable laws or regulations. You shall not upload or store any Illegal Content, or any infringing, offensive, threatening, libellous, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate data or content to the Service.

16.4. You are responsible for making necessary and appropriate backup copies of the Customer Data stored in the Service. Such backup copies must be stored outside the Service.

#### 17\. Confidentiality

17.1. The Parties may exchange Confidential Information during the performance of the Agreement. “**Confidential Information**” means any non-public information which is marked as confidential or which should be understood as confidential, irrespective of its form of storage or disclosure, including in particular Customer Data. Any information of or relating to a Party or that Party’s Affiliates, personnel, suppliers, contractors, customers or end-users, which information is obtained or detected by the other Party or processed or generated in the course of providing or receiving the Service shall be deemed Confidential Information of that Party.

17.2. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party, and the receiving Party shall keep it confidential and refrain from using it otherwise than for the purposes of the Agreement. The Parties shall limit access to the Confidential Information within their organisations to only those Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, agents, and advisors (including attorneys, accountants, and consultants) (collectively, “**Associates**”) who need to access the Confidential Information for the purposes of the Agreement. The receiving Party shall ensure that its Associates are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those set forth herein before disclosing any Confidential Information.

17.3. The confidentiality obligations herein shall not apply to Confidential Information which:

(i) is or becomes known publicly through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving Party;

(ii) was known to the receiving Party prior to the disclosure hereunder, and has not been obtained directly or indirectly from the disclosing Party;

(iii) is lawfully disclosed to the receiving Party in good faith by a third party having rights therein without restriction on disclosure;

(iv) has been approved for release by the disclosing Party; or

(v) has been independently developed by the receiving Party without the use of and prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the disclosing Party.

17.4. Notwithstanding the above, the receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to third parties where compelled to do so by law or an order of Governmental Authority. Unless prohibited by law or an order of Governmental Authority, the receiving Party shall take reasonable steps to notify the disclosing Party of such disclosure request or order.

17.5. Each Party shall promptly upon termination of the Agreement cease using Confidential Information of the other Party and use reasonable means to destroy such Confidential Information. Each Party shall, however, be entitled to retain the copies of Confidential Information which: (i) the Party is required to retain by applicable laws; and (ii) are generated pursuant to the receiving Party’s electronic backup system if destroying such copies would be unreasonable taking into account the costs and effort required to do so.

#### 18\. Intellectual Property Rights

18.1. All title and intellectual property rights pertaining to and in the Service (including all modifications, extensions, customisations, scripts or other derivative works of the Service provided or developed by UpCloud) are exclusive property of UpCloud or its licensors. Any rights in the Service or UpCloud’s intellectual property not expressly granted herein by UpCloud are reserved by UpCloud. Moreover, UpCloud has the right to collect and process aggregated, anonymised data that is derived from and/or created through the use of the Service by the Customer and/or its Users, provided that the data does not identify the Customer or any natural person.

18.2 The Customer grants UpCloud a royalty free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable right to use, modify, distribute and incorporate into the Service (without attribution of any kind) any suggestions, enhancement request, recommendations, proposals, correction or other feedback or information provided by the Customer or any User relating to the operation or functionality of the Service.

#### 19\. Limitation of Liability

19.1. Neither Party shall be liable for any indirect or consequential damages, such as loss of profit, sales or business, loss of anticipated savings, loss of goodwill or reputation, loss of use or corruption of software, data or information, purchase of replacing third-party services or products.

19.2. UpCloud’s maximum liability under or in connection with the Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate service fees paid by the Customer to UpCloud during the last six (6) months immediately preceding the occurrence of the event giving rise to the liability (“**Liability Cap**”). Notwithstanding the above, UpCloud’s maximum liability for damage caused by a breach of the DPA shall be limited to two (2) times the Liability Cap.

19.3. The above limitations of liability shall not apply to damage caused intentionally or by gross negligence, or to liability which, under the applicable law, cannot be excluded.

19.4. In order to be valid and enforceable, the Customer must present any claims for damages within six (6) months after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim.

#### 20\. Force Majeure

20.1. Force Majeure is an event that prevents, or makes unduly difficult, the performance of the Service or the fulfilment of the provisions of the Agreement, such as war, rebellion, natural catastrophe, act of government, general interruption in energy distribution or telecommunications, fire, strike, embargoes or sanctions, or another equally significant event independent of a Party. Each Party shall be entitled to suspend its duties without liability thereof in case of Force Majeure affecting the Party either directly or indirectly through its subcontractor.

20.2. If a Party is prevented from fulfilling its duties due to Force Majeure for more than 60 (sixty) days, the other Party has the right to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect.

#### 21\. Export Control and Sanctions

21.2. You represent and warrant that you (or any of your owners, directors or officers) or the Users are not designated under or targeted by any Sanctions Regulations, and that you are not acting on behalf of any such individual or person.

21.3.

22.2. UpCloud may ask the Customer to participate in a case study about the Customer’s use of the Service. UpCloud is not allowed to publish the case study without the Customer’s prior approval. Provided that the Customer approves the case study, UpCloud shall have a royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide right and licence to reproduce, publish, distribute, and translate the case study, whether in written or recorded form. The case study may be used on UpCloud’s website, UpCloud’s social media channels (such as YouTube, and LinkedIn), and other sales and marketing presentations and materials.

#### 23\. Termination for Convenience

You have the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing at least five (5) days’ written notice to us and we have the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing at least 30 (thirty) days’ written notice to you. However, if the Parties have signed a separate fixed-term contract by which you commit to using the Service for a fixed contract period, then the Parties’ right to terminate the Agreement shall be controlled by the terms of that separate contract.

#### 24\. Termination for Cause

Either Party may terminate the Agreement with immediate effect if the other Party:-

(i) has materially breached the Agreement and has not remedied the breach within 10 (ten) business days from the receipt of a written notice thereof from the other Party; or

(ii) files for bankruptcy or debt rescheduling program, is put into liquidation, or is made subject to any other similar procedures, ceases its payments, or fails to pay its invoices when due.

#### 25\. Entire Agreement and Amendments

25.1. The Agreement (including all webpages and documents referred to or linked herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all previous commitments between the Parties in respect of the provision of the Service.

25.2. All amendments to the Agreement must be made in writing. We have the right to modify these Terms by posting a revised version of the Terms on UpCloud’s website. If we consider the revision to be material, we will notify you in writing at least 30 (thirty) days before the revision will be effected and reserve you a possibility to terminate the Agreement, unless the revision is implemented due to changes in legislation, in which case we may effect it without an advance notice. If you continue using the Service, you will be deemed to have accepted the revised Terms as part of the Agreement.

#### 26\. Non-Waiver

A failure by either Party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not be deemed to constitute a present or future waiver of such provision. All waivers must be made in writing.

#### 27\. Assignment and Third-Party Beneficiaries

27.1. Neither Party may transfer the Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). However, such consent shall not be required if: (i) UpCloud transfers the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of UpCloud’s Affiliates; (ii) UpCloud (or its future assignee) transfers the right to receive payments and related rights due by the Customer under the Agreement; or (iii) UpCloud transfers the Agreement to a third party in connection with the purchase of all or substantially all of UpCloud’s business or assets or any deemed transfer by UpCloud by reason of merger, consolidation, change-in-control or corporate reorganisation. UpCloud has the right to use its Affiliates and other qualified subcontractors to provide the Service to the Customer, provided that UpCloud remains responsible to the Customer for the performance of the subcontractors.

27.2. The Customer’s obligations towards UpCloud and the provisions regarding UpCloud’s limitations of liability are in place also for the benefit of UpCloud’s Affiliates, subcontractors, personnel and owners. Otherwise the Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any third party.

#### 28\. Severability

If any provision of the Agreement is ruled unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Parties shall attempt through negotiation in good faith to replace the unenforceable provision with such provisions that correspond as closely as possible to the original intention of the Parties.

However, the Customer shall primarily use the corresponding control  functions of the Service in responding to such requests, such as the Control Panel.

6.2. UpCloud shall further provide the Customer with commercially reasonable assistance in enabling compliance with the Customer’s, and where applicable, End-Customer’s (as a data controller in each case), obligations to perform data protection impact assessments, breach notifications and prior consultations of the competent Supervisory Authority, as set out in the applicable Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to UpCloud.

6.3. If the Customer requires assistance from UpCloud, UpCloud shall be entitled to a reasonable remuneration for providing the assistance. The amount of remuneration will be agreed upon between the Parties in advance.

#### 7\. UpCloud’s Personnel

7.1. UpCloud shall ensure that its personnel (including its subprocessors’ personnel) who process the Relevant Personal Data:

(i) process the Relevant Personal Data in accordance with the Customer’s written instructions and only for the purposes allowed under this DPA;

(ii) are informed of the confidential nature of the Relevant Personal Data and are aware of UpCloud’s obligations under this DPA;

(iii) are under confidentiality undertakings or an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; and

(iv) have undertaken appropriate training in relation to the processing of the Relevant Personal Data.

#### 8\. Security Measures

8.1. UpCloud and the Customer shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect the Relevant Personal Data within their areas of responsibility, in order to safeguard the Relevant Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing or access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. Such measures include where necessary and appropriate, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons the following measures:

(i) access right controls to systems containing the Relevant Personal Data;

(ii) the pseudonymisation and encryption of the Relevant Personal Data;

(iii) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;

(iv) the ability to restore the availability and access to the Relevant Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and

(v) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

#### 9\. Subprocessors

9.1. UpCloud is entitled to use subprocessors in the provision of the Service. The subprocessors approved by the Customer are listed in Appendix 1 hereto. The subprocessors actually used by UpCloud depend on the Services ordered by the Customer, as described in Appendix 1.

9.2. UpCloud ensures that the engaged subprocessors are properly qualified, are under a data processing agreement with UpCloud, and comply with data processing obligations similar to the ones which apply to UpCloud under this DPA. UpCloud shall be liable towards the Customer for the processing of Relevant Personal Data carried out by UpCloud’s subprocessors.

9.3. UpCloud is entitled to change its subprocessors. UpCloud shall inform the Customer regarding changes (additions or replacements) in the subprocessors by providing at least 30 (thirty) days’ advance notice, giving the Customer the opportunity to object to such change. The Customer may object to the change by providing a written notice thereof to UpCloud within thirty (30) days after being informed of the change. In such case, the Parties shall strive to find an alternative solution. If such a solution is not found, the Customer may terminate the Agreement without any liability to UpCloud.

#### 10\. International Transfers

10.1. The Customer may choose in which UpCloud data centre(s) the Relevant Personal Data will be processed. Some of the data centres are located outside the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”). UpCloud shall not move the Relevant Personal Data from the selected data centre unless explicitly instructed to do so by the Customer.

10.2. The Customer authorises UpCloud to transfer the Relevant Personal Data outside the EEA to its subprocessors, if and only to the extent such transfers are necessary for the provision of the Service ordered by the Customer. If the Relevant Personal Data needs to be transferred outside the EEA in a country that is not recognised by the European Commission as providing adequate level of protection for personal data, then the Customer accepts that UpCloud performs the international transfer of the Relevant Personal Data in accordance with the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (processor-to-processor module) entered into by UpCloud (as data exporter) and the relevant subprocessor (as data importer).

#### 11\. Audits

11.1. Upon written request of the Customer, UpCloud agrees to make available to the Customer and, where relevant, to the End-Customer, the information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA, and allow for and contribute to audits by the Customer or an established third-party auditor approved by UpCloud (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and agreed by both Parties (“**Mandated Auditor**”), of UpCloud’s systems and premises where the processing of Relevant Personal Data takes place, in order to assess UpCloud’s compliance with this DPA. UpCloud shall permit the Customer, or, where relevant, a Mandated Auditor to inspect and audit UpCloud’s relevant records solely pertaining to the Relevant Personal Data, and to inspect and audit processes and systems related to the processing of the Relevant Personal Data. UpCloud agrees to co-operate in respect of such audits. All audits by the Customer, or, where relevant, by Mandated Auditor are subject to a thirty (30) days’ prior written notice.

11.2. Where an audit may lead to the disclosure of business or trade secrets of UpCloud (or its Affiliates or other customers) or otherwise pose a threat to intellectual property rights of UpCloud, the Customer shall employ a Mandated Auditor to carry out such audit. Whenever a Mandated Auditor is used, the Customer shall procure such Mandated Auditor’s acceptance to be bound to confidentiality to UpCloud’s benefit by way of such confidentiality undertaking as accepted by UpCloud.

11.3. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, the Customer is allowed to conduct one (1) audit in every twelve (12) months. Any audit must be conducted during the normal business hours of UpCloud and in a way that does not cause substantial disturbance to UpCloud’s business operations. The Customer shall bear all costs and expenses relating to the audits conducted hereunder and pay a reasonable compensation to UpCloud for the work required to assist in the audits.

#### 12\. Data Breaches

12.1. UpCloud shall notify the Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any Data Breach, providing the Customer with sufficient information which allows the Customer to meet its obligations to report a Data Breach under the Data Protection Laws. Such notification shall at a minimum:

(i) describe of the nature of the Data Breach, including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Relevant Personal Data records concerned;

(ii) communicate the name and contact details of UpCloud’s contact point where more information can be obtained; and

(iii) description of the measures taken by UpCloud to address the Data Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

12.2. UpCloud shall cooperate with the Customer and, where relevant, the End-Customer, and take commercially reasonable steps to assist in the investigation, mitigation and remediation of the Data Breach.

#### 13\. Deletion and Return of Personal Data

13.1. For deletion and return of the Relevant Personal Data, the Customer shall primarily use the functionalities of the Service through the Control Panel.

13.2. The Customer agrees that within a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of the Agreement, or after the Customer has permanently ceased to use the Services, UpCloud shall delete and procure deletion of all copies of the Relevant Personal Data processed by UpCloud or any subprocessor, unless UpCloud is obliged to retain copies of the Relevant Personal Data pursuant to applicable laws or orders of Governmental Authority.

#### 14\. Liability

14.1. Each Party’s liability for: (i) damages incurred by a data subject and (ii) administrative fines imposed by a Supervisory Authority, in connection with the processing of the Relevant Personal Data under this DPA shall be defined in accordance with Articles 82 and 83, respectively, of the GDPR, or another corresponding and applicable provision of compulsory Data Protection Laws.

14.2. Otherwise the Parties’ liability for a breach of the DPA shall be subject to Section 19 (Limitation of Liability) of the main body of the Terms of Service.

#### 15\. Term

15.1. This DPA remains in force until UpCloud ceases to process the Relevant Personal Data pursuant to the Agreement, whereafter this DPA shall automatically expire.

**APPENDIX 1 – UpCloud Subprocessors**  

UpCloud may utilise its Affiliates (some of which are located outside the EEA) in the provision of the Service, as may be necessary for the provision of the Services ordered by the Customer.

UpCloud’s Operations Team members may need to work with or handle resources containing Customer Data when maintaining UpCloud’s data centre infrastructure or resolving issues reported by the Customer (e.g. moving storages from one physical host machine to another physical host machine in the same data centre). As the Article 4 of the GDPR provides a very extensive definition for ‘processing‘, such actions can be deemed as processing under the GDPR even though they do not entail accessing the Customer Data. Therefore UpCloud considers some of its Affiliates as subprocessors regardless of the data centre(s) the Customer has selected. However, UpCloud personnel will never take actions to access the Customer Data, unless specifically requested by and agreed in advance with the Customer.

The following tables describes in which cases UpCloud Affiliates will be utilised in the provision of the Services:

UpCloud data centres within the European Union (FI-HEL1, FI-HEL2, SE-STO1, NL-AMS1, DE-FRA1, PL-WAW1, ES-MAD1) are operated directly by UpCloud Oy, and no subprocessors will be utilised in connection with these data centres.

Service Level Agreement
-----------------------

**1\. Scope.** This service level agreement (“**SLA**”) is an integral part of the Agreement between UpCloud and the Customer. This SLA does not apply to: (i) Free Trials; (ii) UpCloud website; (iii) APIs of the Service; and (iv) the Control Panel.

**2\. Service Guarantee.** Subject to the exemptions set out in Sections 1 and 8 of this SLA, we will guarantee you the availability of the Services. For all unscheduled interruptions in the provision of the Service that last longer than five (5) minutes, you will be entitled to an SLA-compensation in accordance with this SLA. The availability guarantee is applied on a per Service-item basis and is not applicable to such Service-items that are not directly affected by the interruption. For example, if you have five virtual servers and one of them is unavailable, the SLA-compensation will be calculated based on that one server’s downtime and not based on your entire Service portfolio.

**3\. Scheduled Interruptions.** We will notify you by e-mail or by publishing a notice on UpCloud’s website about scheduled interruptions in the provision of the Service at least 24 hours prior to the interruption, with the exception of important security updates and patches which we may deploy without prior notice.

**4\. Error Notifications.** If you detect an interruption in the Service, you have to notify us by sending an e-mail to [\[email protected\]](https://upcloud.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The interruption in the Service is deemed to begin when the failure starts to affect your use of the Service, and to end when the failure has been corrected. We will maintain a system status page at [https://status.upcloud.com/](https://status.upcloud.com/?_ga=2.231260956.2047200324.1681193158-1397398912.1667313581) where we will post information about identified interruptions and their resolution status.

**5\. Payment of Compensation.** If you are eligible for an SLA-compensation under this SLA, you must claim the SLA-compensation within 15 (fifteen) days after the failure has been corrected by contacting our Support Team at [\[email protected\]](https://upcloud.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and requesting the SLA-compensation. The SLA-compensation will be deposited to your Account in the form of Credits and it may not be exchanged for cash or other forms of payment.

**6\. Amount of SLA-compensation.** The amount of the SLA-compensation will be 50 (fifty) times UpCloud’s service fees charged for the interrupted Service-item allocated for the period of time when the use of that Service-item was interrupted. The maximum SLA-compensation for an individual interruption shall be limited to an amount equal to the service fees charged by UpCloud for the interrupted Service-item during 30 (thirty) calendar days immediately preceding the interruption. The total sum of aggregated SLA-compensations during any 12-month period shall be limited to an amount equal to the average monthly service fee charged by UpCloud for the interrupted Service during that 12-month period multiplied by 2,5.

**7\. Sole Remedy.** The SLA-compensation set out above will be your sole remedy for any interruptions in the Service. In case of a disagreement over the amount of the SLA-compensation payable to the Customer, UpCloud’s decision on the issue will be binding on the Parties until and unless a competent court rules otherwise.

**8\. Exemptions from Service Guarantee.** The following situations will be exempt from UpCloud’s service guarantee and thus not subject to SLA-compensation:

1. Scheduled interruptions and deployment of important security updates and patches.
2. Force Majeure events.
3. Failures caused by errors in Third-Party Products utilised by the Customer within the Service.
4. Failures in products or services which are not part of the Service or provided by UpCloud.
5. Failures caused by the Customer’s actions contrary to user instructions or resulting from the Customer’s operating systems or application software used within the Service.
6. Interruptions in the Service relating to the Customer’s violation of or failure to comply with these Terms or a User’s violations of the Acceptable Use Policy.
7. Failures caused by hostile actions of third parties, such as denial-of-service attacks.
8. Interruptions relating to actions UpCloud is obliged to take pursuant to applicable laws or Governmental Authority’s orders.
9. Interruptions resulting from the Customer not having sufficient balance of Credits on the Account for the use of the Service at the time of the interruption.
