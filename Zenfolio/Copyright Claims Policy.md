Date of Last Revision: June 26, 2023

Zenfolio respects the intellectual property of others, and we expect our users to do the same. Zenfolio may suspend and/or terminate the accounts of users who infringe the rights of others. Zenfolio has adopted the following policy in accordance with Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).  If you believe that your copyrights or other intellectual property rights have been infringed by postings of others through the Zenfolio website, or photographer sites hosted by it, you should provide Zenfolio’s Copyright Agent with the following information: 

* an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
* a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site;
* your address, telephone number, and email address;
* a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

Once a proper infringement notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Zenfolio may remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material.  Zenfolio will make reasonable attempts to notify the Zenfolio User that Zenfolio has removed or disabled access to the material. Zenfolio may terminate access to the service to Zenfolio Users who are repeat offenders.

If a Zenfolio User believes that their material that was removed or to which access was disabled is not infringing upon a copyright, that Zenfolio User must send a counter-notice to the Copyright Agent, pursuant to 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  The counter-notice must contain the following information:

* an electronic or physical signature of the Zenfolio User or person authorized to act on behalf of the Zenfolio User;
* The location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
* A statement under penalty of perjury that the Zenfolio User has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
* The Zenfolio User’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the Zenfolio User consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the Zenfolio User’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Zenfolio may be found, and that the Zenfolio User will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Zenfolio may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Zenfolio may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Zenfolio User, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored after receipt of the counter-notice in accordance with the DMCA.

A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Zenfolio’s Copyright Agent at [\[email protected\]](https://zenfolio.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) (Subject line: “DMCA Takedown Request”).  You may also contact us by mail at:  Zenfolio Inc., Attn: Legal Department – DMCA Notices, 303 Twin Dolphin Drive, 6th Floor, Redwood City, CA 94065; telephone +1 650 364 3423. You may also Contact us online. 

For any complaints originating from the EU, we accept a notice that conforms with the requirements of the EU E-Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC).
