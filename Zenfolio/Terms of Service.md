**33\. Additional Terms: Zenfolio® BookMe Addendum**

33.1. This Zenfolio BookMe Addendum (the “Addendum”), issued by Zenfolio, Inc., (“Zenfolio,” “we,” “us,” “our”), sets forth the terms for your use of Zenfolio’s BookMe booking tool and related service (the “Service”) as a photographer (“Photographer,” “you” or “your”).  This Addendum supplements Zenfolio’s [Terms of Service](https://zenfolio.com/termsofuse) and [Privacy Policy](https://zenfolio.com/privacypolicy) (collectively, the “Standard Terms”) which also apply to your use of the Service.  Capitalized terms in this Addendum shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Standard Terms unless otherwise defined in this Addendum.  The Service constitutes a “Service” and one of the “Photographer Services” as defined in the Terms of Service, so all provisions in the Standard Terms that apply to a “Service” and to “Photographer Services” shall apply to the Service described in this Addendum, provided that in the event of any conflict between the Standard Terms and this Addendum, this Addendum shall control.

33.2. The Service enables Photographers and their customers (“Customers”) to easily arrange photoshoots and arrange for payment through third-party payment platforms.  To process photoshoot payments using Stripe, Photographers must have established an account with Stripe, as provided in the Standard Terms.  Photographers may use alternate payment providers, but must establish their own relationships with those alternative payment providers.

33.3. By electing to use the Service, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Zenfolio may need to review and analyze the content of messages sent by and to you using the messaging features of the Service (“Message Content”) and uploaded content for the purposes of supporting Customers and Photographers, for confirming communications and photoshoots, for compliance with Service requirements, and for resolving any conflicts, confusion and disputes (collectively, “Message Analysis”). Per the requirements of 18 U.S.C. §2702(b), Zenfolio needs your express consent for Zenfolio and its employees and contractors (“personnel”) to use and access that Message Content for Message Analysis. Accordingly, by accepting these Terms, you hereby grant Zenfolio and our personnel a limited license to review your Message Content for the purposes of Message Analysis and to review uploaded content for the purposes of providing the Service. PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CUSTOMERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHILE THE SERVICE FACILITATES PHOTOSHOOTS BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CUSTOMERS, ZENFOLIO IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHERS AND CUSTOMERS, ZENFOLIO DOES NOT MANAGE PAYMENTS FOR PHOTOSHOOTS, AND ZENFOLIO HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF PHOTOGRAPHERS OR CUSTOMERS, SO ZENFOLIO WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS OR LIABILITY THAT MAY ARISE BETWEEN A CUSTOMER AND A PHOTOGRAPHER RELATED TO AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THEM OR FOR ANY PAYMENTS PAID OR PAYABLE FOR SUCH PHOTOSHOOTS.

33.4. **NOTICE REGARDING MESSAGES FOR BOOKME:** BY ACCEPTING THIS ADDENDUM, YOU AGREE AND HEREBY PROVIDE YOUR CONSENT, THAT ZENFOLIO MAY CONTACT YOU BY EMAIL AND SMS REGARDING APPOINTMENTS MADE THROUGH BOOKME.  FOR EMAIL MESSAGES SENT TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, YOU MAY OPT OUT OF RECEIVING THEM AS PROVIDED IN THOSE EMAILS.  FOR SMS COMMUNICATIONS TO YOUR WIRELESS PHONE NUMBER, YOU MAY OPT OUT OF RECEIVING THOSE MESSAGES BY FOLLOWING ACCOMPANYING INSTRUCTIONS OR OTHERWISE BY CONTACTING ZENFOLIO SUPPORT AT [\[email protected\]](https://zenfolio.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) WITH YOUR SPECIFIC OPT OUT REQUEST.  FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PARAGRAPH, REFERENCE TO “SMS” SHALL MEAN BOTH SMS AND MMS MESSAGES.

33.5. **Photographer Participation.** To use the Service, the Photographer must first purchase a subscription, which is nonrefundable.  Photographers can then use the mechanisms made available by Zenfolio to provide information regarding the types of photoshoots offered, geographic travel radius for photoshoots, and pricing information for photoshoots.  Some information may be imported based on the information you’ve already provided to Zenfolio as part of Photographer Services. Further, depending on the version of the Service made available by Zenfolio, a Photographer may be able to enable Google calendar synchronization through features of the Service, and by doing so, the Photographer is granting Zenfolio the right to utilize the Photographer’s access credentials to import calendar information and to publish imported information available through the Service. CERTAIN SUBSCRIPTIONS MAY OFFER A TRIAL PERIOD AT A DISCOUNTED RATE AND, AT THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD, THE SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD YOU’VE SELECTED AT THE STANDARD RATE FOR THAT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD UNLESS THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELED PRIOR TO THE END OF THE TRIAL. TO AVOID RENEWAL AFTER THE TRIAL AND TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE STANDARD RATE UPON RENEWAL, YOU MUST CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE TRIAL PERIOD ENDS.

33.6. **Scheduling, Pricing & Delivery.**  While the Service may provide mechanisms for Customers to book photoshoots with Photographers and for Photographers to select pricing, the scheduling and pricing of photoshoots, any photoshoot cancellations or modifications, the delivery of photos to Customers, and any refund policies shall be as agreed upon by the Customer and the Photographer. 

33.7. **Fees & Payments from Customers.** The Service allows for Customers to be charged the fees for photoshoots, plus applicable taxes (if any), at the time of making the booking using the Photographer’s chosen payment method. Photographers are solely responsible for managing their relationship with the payment method provider and for any payments, refunds, chargebacks and/or credits involving Customers engaged through the Service.  You agree that you will maintain an active credit card associated with your account (both with Zenfolio and the payment method provider) in order to utilize the Service.  You represent and warrant that you will be responsible for all refunds, chargebacks and/or credits.  Further, you agree; (i) that, should the Photographer fail to honor any refunds, chargebacks and/or credits requested by the Customer, Zenfolio may charge that Photographer’s credit card for such amounts to the extent Zenfolio is charged for, or honors, the same; and (ii) to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Zenfolio Parties from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising from failure to property issue any refunds and/or credits.

33.8. **Prohibited Activities.** Photographers’ use of the Service is subject to Zenfolio’s policies for use of the Service (“Policies”) as published from time to time on the Zenfolio website at www.zenfolio.com, which are incorporated herein by reference.  Photographers may not book any photoshoots which violate applicable laws or the Policies.  Some areas of the Service may implement the Google Maps/Earth Mapping and/or Google Calendar services. Use of the Google Maps/Earth Mapping features is subject to the [Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html); use of the Google Calendar features is subject to the [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms/), and use of either is subject to the [Google Privacy Policy.](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

33.9. **Service Requirements.** Photographers acknowledge and agree that the Service is only an online venue for Photographers and Customers. Any agreements reached by and between Photographers and Customers are solely among such parties. The Service is a tool to allow Photographers and Customers to arrange bookings and Zenfolio is not a party to any transaction for any photoshoot or booking, and makes no representations or warranties to either Photographers or Customers that either party is suitable or qualified to engage in such transactions.  To the full extent permitted by law, Zenfolio Parties: (i) make no promises, warranties, or representations with respect to Customers or any third parties; (ii) make no warranties regarding the Service, which is provided “AS-IS” without warranty of any kind; (iii) disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement; and (iv) disclaim any liability or responsibility for acts, omissions, or conduct of Customers in connection with Service.

33.10. **Zenfolio Guidelines.**  Photographer must comply with all of our guidelines and policies, as adopted and published by the Zenfolio from time to time, and which are incorporated herein by reference.
