You must ensure that your Business User ID is not shared with any other person and is kept confidential. You are responsible for any and all activity occurring under your Business User ID. You will promptly notify Trainerize of any actual or suspected unauthorised use of the Service. Trainerize may require that a Business User ID be replaced at any time. That Business User ID, together with any other user information you provide, including but not limited to your social media profiles and location, will form your "**Profile Information**" and allow you to access your Account.

    3. We do not provide backups of your Profile Information, and you are responsible for any Profile Information that may be lost or unrecoverable through the use of the Site or Service.
        
    4. Trainerize may need to ask a Business User to complete additional verification before it allows the Business User to open an Account.

If we accept your order, we will send a confirmation email to you confirming this. A legally binding contract of sale is concluded between you and Trainerize when the confirmation email is sent. At that stage, these Terms of Service are incorporated into that contract of sale. If we do not accept your order, we will notify you of this. We are under no obligation to accept any order, and we do not have to provide reasons for any non-acceptance. We recommend that you print and/or otherwise store a copy of this contract of sale as we do not file or make copies accessible to you.

If a corporate or other organisation’s name appears on the credit or charge card, that corporation or organisation is deemed to be the owner. If any dispute arises as to who owns or controls a Business User ID Profile Information, or Account, the credit or charge card we have on file for the Account will continue to be charged in accordance with this Agreement, and you will be responsible to continue to pay for the Service until Trainerize receives written confirmation from the Account email address confirming a change in ownership and control of the Account.

        1. The Business User warrants, represents and undertakes to Trainerize that:
            
            * it is, and all persons utilising its rights or discharging its obligations on its behalf are, and will at all times be fully compliant with all applicable laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 (the “**Anti-Bribery Requirements**”);

    2. Trainerize will not be required to provide 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that it:
        
        1. is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation which requires it to restrict or suspect your Account, the Site and/or the Service to you in a manner which does not allow it to respect the 30-day notice period;
            
        2. exercises the right to restrict or suspend your Account, the Site and/or the Service under an imperative reason pursuant to applicable law; or
            
        3. can demonstrate that you repeatedly infringe this Agreement.
            
    3. In the case of restriction, suspension or termination, you shall have opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances.

Email requests (from email accounts other than your Trainerize email account) or phone requests to cancel your Account may not be accepted. If you elect to cancel your Account for convenience, you will not be provided with a refund, in whole or in part, of any pre-paid amount. If you cancel your Account because you allege that we are in breach of this Agreement, and you are able to provide satisfactory evidence in support of the allegation, then Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services as a result of your cancellation for cause. You will remain liable for all charges accrued on your Account up to the time of cancellation, including full fees for the then current subscription period in which you cancelled your Account.

Trainerize will not be required to provide 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that it:
            
            * is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation which requires it to terminate the provision of the whole of the Service to you in a manner which does not allow it to respect the 30-day notice period;
                
            * exercises a right of termination under an imperative reason pursuant to applicable law; or
                
            * can demonstrate that you repeatedly infringe this Agreement.
                
        2. Trainerize may terminate for cause with immediate effect by giving written notice if:

            * the Business User fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than 10 days after being notified to make such payment; or

            * a petition is filed, a notice is given, a resolution is passed, or an order is made, for or in connection with the winding up of the Business User;
                
            * an application is made to court, or an order is made, for the appointment of an administrator, or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given or if an administrator is appointed, over the Business User;
                
            * the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the Business User has become entitled to appoint or has appointed an administrative receiver;
                
            * a person becomes entitled to appoint a receiver over all or any of the assets of the Business User or a receiver is appointed over all or any of the assets of the Business User;
                
            * a creditor or encumbrancer of the Business User attaches or takes possession of, or a distress, execution, sequestration or other such process is levied or enforced on or sued against, the whole or any part of the Business User's assets and such attachment or process is not discharged within 14 days;
                
            * any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the Business User in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events mentioned above; or
                
            * the Business User suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business.
                
        3. In the case of restriction, suspension or termination, you shall have the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances.
            
        4. Where Trainerize terminates this Agreement, we will provide a statement of reasons for our decision on a durable medium, unless:
            
            * we are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation not to provide the specific facts or circumstances or the reference to the applicable ground or grounds; or
                
            * we can demonstrate that you have repeatedly infringed the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, resulting in termination of the provision of the whole of the Service.

We will take your first payment upon our acceptance of your order.

    6. We reserve the right to modify our billing rates at any time upon 30 days’ written notice by posting such fee changes to the Site or through email notification to you. You will be liable to pay such modified billing rates unless you choose to terminate this Agreement in accordance with your termination rights set out in the ‘Cancellation and Termination’ Clause below.

You acknowledge and agree that each Payment Processor’s terms will govern your agreement and interactions with that Payment Processor and that our terms and policies do not govern the processing of your payment by any of the Payment Processors, and that we have no liability arising from your use of or access to any Payment Processor’s services. We are not responsible for any errors by any Payment Processor. You should review the applicable terms and policies of each Payment Processor, including their privacy and data gathering practices, available at the following websites:

Trademarks include logos, brand names, and trade dress, which is the distinctive visual appearance of a product or its packaging. Please be aware that celebrities, and others, may have a "right of publicity," which means that they may have a right to control commercial uses of their name, image, likeness, and other aspects of their identity. If you use a celebrity name or likeness on the Service and you do not have the appropriate permission, you risk infringing the celebrity’s rights, and depending on the circumstances, this may be true for non-celebrities as well.
        
    5. If you believe your rights have been infringed, please contact us without delay at [\[email protected\]](https://www.trainerize.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

        1. your non-use or misuse of the Service and any Content, including without limitation your Profile Information, any Content you make available through the Site or Service, and any Content provided by you and forming part of the Site;

        3. your violation of any rights, including intellectual property rights, of a third party as set out herein.
            
    3. Trainerize reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Trainerize and you agree to cooperate with Trainerize’s defence of these Claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Trainerize. Trainerize will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such Claims upon becoming aware of it.
        
14. **INSURANCE**
    
    5. During this Agreement you shall maintain in force insurance policies with reputable insurance companies, against all risks that would normally be insured against by a prudent businessperson in connection with the risks associated with this Agreement, and produce to Trainerize on demand full particulars of that insurance and the receipt for the then current premium.
        
15. **COMPLIANCE**
    
    1. Anti-Slavery and Anti-Bribery
        
        1. The Business User warrants, represents and undertakes to Trainerize that:
            
            * it is, and all persons utilising its rights or discharging its obligations on its behalf are, and will at all times be fully compliant with all applicable laws relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption (the “**Anti-Bribery Requirements**”);
                
            * it has and shall maintain adequate procedures, methodologies and structures in place to prevent persons associated with it from undertaking conduct that might amount to a breach of the Anti-Bribery Requirements and which at least meet or exceed the procedures, methodologies and structures recommended by prevailing government-issued guidance and those implemented in accordance with good industry practice for its business sector;
                
            * it shall promptly disclose to Trainerize in writing any instance of soliciting, receiving from or offering to any third party any bribe or other benefit in connection with its performance of this Agreement;
                
            * it, and all persons utilising its rights or discharging its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement on its behalf, are and will at all times be fully compliant with all applicable laws relating to anti-slavery and human trafficking, including the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2019 (the “**Anti-Slavery Requirements**”);
                
            * it shall not engage in any activity, practice or conduct that would constitute an offence under the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2019 (if such activity, practice or conduct were carried out in Australia);
                
            * it has and shall maintain adequate procedures, methodologies and structures in place to prevent persons associated with it (including subcontractors or other members of its supply chain) from undertaking conduct which might amount to a breach of the Anti-Slavery Requirements and to respond to and deal with actual or potential breaches of the Anti-Slavery Requirements; and
                
            * it shall notify Trainerize as soon as it becomes aware of any breach of the Anti-Slavery Requirements or any actual or suspected slavery or human trafficking in a supply chain which has a connection with this Agreement.
                
    2. Preventing the criminal facilitation of tax evasion
        
        1. The Business User shall comply with all applicable laws relating to tax evasion and the criminal facilitation of tax evasion.
            
        2. The Business User shall not take any action to criminally facilitate tax evasion by a taxpayer either in Australia, New Zealand or overseas. Criminal tax evasion includes any fraudulent activity that intends to divert funds from the public revenue. Criminal facilitation of tax evasion includes deliberately and dishonestly facilitating the commission of revenue fraud by another person.
            
        3. The Business User confirms that it is responsible for its own tax affairs, is subject to taxes in full in the jurisdiction in which it is established, and that it does not criminally facilitate the evasion of tax by a taxpayer either in Australia, New Zealand or overseas.
            
16. **SUSPENSION OF ACCOUNT**
    
    1. If Trainerize in its sole discretion considers that there is a need to restrict or suspend your Account, the Site and/or the Service, we will provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of this.
        
    2. If Trainerize elects to suspend your Account, the Site and/or the Service for a significant period of time, Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the period of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services. You will not receive any such refund in the event that Trainerize is suspending your Account, the Site and/or Service to you as a result of your breach of this Agreement in which case, to the extent permitted by law, Trainerize will have no liability whatsoever for any damages, liabilities, losses or any other consequences that you may incur as a result.
        
    3. This Clause 16 does not affect your rights of termination as set out in the ‘Cancellation and Termination’ Clause below.
        
17. **CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION**
    
    1. You may cancel your Account at any time through the interface provided as part of the Service. Cancellation must be issued via the interface. This is the only way to cancel your Account. Email requests (from email accounts other than your Trainerize email account) or phone requests to cancel your Account may not be accepted. If you elect to cancel your Account for convenience, you will not be provided with a refund, in whole or in part, of any pre-paid amount. If you cancel your Account because you allege that we are in breach of this Agreement, and you are able to provide satisfactory evidence in support of the allegation, then Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription or renewal period (as applicable) during which you will not receive the Services as a result of your cancellation for cause. You will remain liable for all charges accrued on your Account up to the time of cancellation, including full fees for the then current subscription period in which you cancelled your Account.
        
    2. Trainerize reserves the right to terminate this Agreement as follows:
        
        1. Trainerize may terminate for convenience (i.e., without cause) by giving 30 days’ written notice (subject to the exceptions set out in this Clause). In these circumstances, Trainerize shall refund any amounts already paid by you on a pro rata basis to reflect the remaining time of the current subscription period during which you will not receive the Services as a result of Trainerize’s termination for convenience. Trainerize will not be required to provide 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that it:
            
            * is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation which requires it to terminate the provision of the whole of the Service to you in a manner which does not allow it to respect the 30-day notice period;
                
            * exercises a right of termination under an imperative reason pursuant to applicable law; or
                
            * can demonstrate that you repeatedly infringe this Agreement.
                
        2. Trainerize may terminate for cause with immediate effect by giving written notice if:
            
            * the Business User commits a material breach of any term of this Agreement and (if such breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within a period of 10 days after being notified to do so;
                
            * the Business User fails to pay any amount due under this Agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than 10 days after being notified to make such payment; or
                
            * there is a change in control or ownership of the Business User;
                
            * the Business User suspends or threatens to suspend payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts as they fall due or admits inability to pay its debts or is deemed unable to pay its debts;
                
            * the Business User commences negotiations with all or any class of its creditors with a view to rescheduling any of its debts, or makes a proposal for or enters into any compromise or arrangement with any of its creditors;
                
            * a petition is filed, a notice is given, a resolution is passed, or an order is made, for or in connection with the winding up of the Business User;
                
            * an application is made to court, or an order is made, for the appointment of an administrator, or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is given or if an administrator is appointed, over the Business User;
                
            * the holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the Business User has become entitled to appoint or has appointed an administrative receiver;
                
            * a person becomes entitled to appoint a receiver over all or any of the assets of the Business User or a receiver is appointed over all or any of the assets of the Business User;
                
            * a creditor or encumbrancer of the Business User attaches or takes possession of, or a distress, execution, sequestration or other such process is levied or enforced on or sued against, the whole or any part of the Business User's assets and such attachment or process is not discharged within 14 days;
                
            * any event occurs, or proceeding is taken, with respect to the Business User in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events mentioned above; or
                
            * the Business User suspends or ceases, or threatens to suspend or cease, carrying on all or a substantial part of its business.
                
        3. In the case of restriction, suspension or termination, you shall have the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances.
            
        4. Where Trainerize terminates this Agreement, we will provide a statement of reasons for our decision on a durable medium, unless:
            
            * we are subject to a legal or regulatory obligation not to provide the specific facts or circumstances or the reference to the applicable ground or grounds; or
                
            * we can demonstrate that you have repeatedly infringed the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, resulting in termination of the provision of the whole of the Service.
                
    3. On termination of this Agreement for any reason:
        
        1. your Account will be deleted;
            
        2. you will not have access to any information provided by you or generated by you or stored on your Account (including but not limited to your Profile Information and Content);
            
        3. the limited license granted to you in Clause 11.2 shall immediately cease;
            
        4. you may be prohibited and blocked from creating further Accounts; and
            
        5. any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination will remain in full force and effect.
            
18. **OUR LIABILITY**
    
    1. Nothing in this Agreement excludes or limits our liability for:
        
        1. death or personal injury caused by our negligence; or
            
        2. fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or
            
        3. any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability.
            
    2. Trainerize does not seek to exclude or restrict its liability where to do so would be illegal or ineffective. Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes any liability which cannot legally be limited, including under the consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law. If there is a major failure in the delivery of the Service to you in Australia, you will under the law be entitled at your election to:
        
        1. a resupply of the Service;
            
        2. a refund; and/or
            
        3. compensation.
            
    3. Save as set out in Clause 18.1 and 18.2, the following sub-clauses apply: 
        
        1. in no event shall Trainerize be liable to the Business User for any loss of profits; loss of sales, business or revenue; loss of agreements or contracts; loss of or failure to achieve anticipated savings; loss of use or corruption of software, data or information; loss of or damage to goodwill; or any indirect or consequential loss;
            
        2. in no event shall Trainerize be liable to the Business User for any loss or damage that the Business User suffers under or in connection with any End User contract;
            
        3. Trainerize’s total and aggregate liability to you in respect of any loss or damage suffered and arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise shall not exceed the amount of AU$1000.
            
    4. This Clause 18 shall survive termination or expiry of this Agreement.

    3. A notice given under this Agreement in relation to the termination of, or legal proceedings arising out of or in relation to, this Agreement, is not valid if sent only by email.

The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended accordingly.
        
    3. Neither party shall be entitled to rely on this Clause 20 to claim that it has been prevented, hindered or delayed in its payment of any amount due to the other party under this Agreement.
        
    4. The Affected Party shall:
        
        1. as soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the Force Majeure Event, notify the other party of the Force Majeure Event, the date on which it started, its likely or potential duration, and the effect of the Force Majeure Event on its ability to perform any of its obligations under the Agreement; and
            
        2. use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate the effect of the Force Majeure Event on the performance of its obligations.
            
    5. If the Force Majeure Event prevents, hinders or delays the Affected Party's performance of its obligations for a continuous period of more than 14 days, the party not affected by the Force Majeure Event may terminate this Agreement by giving 1 week’s written notice to the Affected Party.
        
21. **OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION**
    
    1. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership or joint venture between any of the parties, constitute any party the agent of another party, or authorise any party to make or enter into any commitments for or on behalf of any other party. Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.
        
    2. If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole will not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void or unenforceable will be stricken from this Agreement.
        
    3. You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under this Agreement if Trainerize agrees in writing. Trainerize may transfer its rights under this Agreement at any time without restriction provided that such assignment will not affect your rights or obligations under this Agreement.
        
    4. This Agreement is the entire agreement between us related to the subject matter in this Agreement. This Agreement replaces and supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous agreement, representation or discussion, oral or written, and may not be changed except in writing signed by us, regardless of whether or not the parties act under an unsigned "electronic" agreement or rely on such an unsigned agreement.
        
    5. Each party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement it does not rely on and shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Agreement. Each party agrees that it shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this Agreement.
        
    6. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
        
    7. Each party at its own cost agrees to do and execute and perform such further deeds, documents, assurances, acts and things as may be required to give effect to the terms, intent and purposes of this Agreement.
