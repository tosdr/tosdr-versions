3. Processing of Personal Information
    1. Our Services collect the following categories of Personal Information:
        1. Information you submit to us
            1. _Account and identity information:_ in the event that you choose to register as a user of the Services, you will be asked to create a unique username and private password (collectively, the “**Access ID**”) which will be used to create and activate an account through which we can make the Services available to you (the “**Account**”). We may require certain information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address to make the Services available to you. Trainers may also elect to import their trainees’ contacts and information contained from their contact lists.
            2. _Fitness information:_ you may choose to provide other information to improve your experience or enable certain features of the Services. If you are a Trainer (as defined in the Terms of Service), such information can include fitness and meal plans you create for Trainees (as defined in the Terms of Service). If you are a Trainee, such information can include your fitness and nutrition information.
            3. _Financial information:_ we may collect billing and other financial information to process payments required in connection with the Services.
            4. _Commercial information:_ we maintain records about the transactions you engage in with us or other parties (e.g., a Trainer) through the Services, such as information about purchases, what has been provided to you, when and where, if applicable, how much you paid, and similar information.
            5. _User content:_ you may choose to provide additional information to improve your experience or for Trainees’ or Trainers’ experiences which may be in any form, such as text, images, sound, or video.

            2. _Location Information:_ With your consent, we collect Personal Information about your location.
        3. Information we collect from third parties
            1. _Social Media and App Information:_ If you link your Account to third-party services, we may collect information about you from such other services. You can also link your Account to other social media, fitness, or business applications. The types of information we may collect from such third-party services depends on the nature of the third-party services you connect to your Account. For example, you can link your account to Facebook and import your Facebook profile information. You may also choose to grant us access to fitness or activity information from a third-party fitness application.
            2. _YouTube API Data:_ Without limiting the foregoing, the Services use certain YouTube API Services. Google, which operates YouTube, describes its processing of Personal Information in its privacy policy at [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy). We process data, content (including audiovisual content) and information provided to the Services through the YouTube API services, including without limitation YouTube Video ID information, connection tokens for YouTube channels, and YouTube video thumbnail information (collectively, the “**YouTube API Data**”) to provide the functionality of the Services to you, including without limitation to (i) enable Trainers to search and select video content (including training exercises) for sharing and display to Trainees and other users of the Services; (ii) enable Trainers to connect to their YouTube channel, and create custom video content (including training exercises) for the Services and link to, share and display such content and control the settings of such content (including un-listing the content from YouTube); (iii) enable Trainers, Trainees, and other users of the Services to play YouTube content through the Services.
            3. _Consumer profile information:_ Information used to create a profile about you reflecting your preferences, market segments, likes, favorites and other data or analytics provided about you or your account by a Trainer, TSR Customer, social media companies or data aggregators, including household data, the products and services you use or intend to use or purchase, and your interests.
    2. We use Personal Information for the following purposes:

We generally consider the following factors when we determine how long to retain Personal Information: (1) retention periods established under applicable law; (2) industry best practices; (3) whether the purpose of processing is reasonably likely to justify further processing; (4) risks to individual privacy in continued processing; (5) applicable data protection impact assessments; (6) IT systems design considerations/limitations; and (7) the costs associated with continued processing, retention, and deletion.

    3. We may also, on occasion, process Personal Information on the basis of your consent. Under such circumstances, you have the right to withdraw your consent.
  
7. Disclosure of Personal Information

We disclose Personal Information as described below.

By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.
