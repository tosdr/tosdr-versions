### Policy Scope & Updates

**Scope.** The purpose of our Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is to describe how the websites, mobile applications, and online services owned or operated by us (collectively called the “Site” in this Policy) process your information in connection with the products and services that we offer. This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information and how we keep it safe. It also explains where you can go to exercise your rights and choices about how your personal information is used. Before you provide us with your information or otherwise use our Site, you should read through this Policy and our Terms of Use to make sure that you are comfortable with our privacy practices.   
  
**Brands.** Our Site is owned, operated, and maintained by KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION and our affiliated companies and [brands](https://www.kimberly-clark.com/brands/our-brands) (“Kimberly-Clark”, “we”, “our” or “us”).    
  
**State- or Country-Specific Disclosures.** This Policy includes additional state- or country-specific information (such as the specific rights regarding your personal information that may be available in your jurisdiction) within the [State- or Country-Specific Disclosures](#disclosures) section. If there is a conflict between this Policy and the State- or Country-Specific Disclosures section, the latter will control only as to the extent of the conflict.

What Personal Information We Collect
------------------------------------

**Personal Information.** Personal information means any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a specific individual. We may collect personal information from a variety of sources. These sources include personal information that:

* **you give to us directly** (e.g., when you sign up for things like newsletters, sweepstakes, surveys or promotions or register for an account on our Sites and provide information like your name, email address and date of birth);
* **we collect automatically** (e.g., when you browse our Site and interact with us online, we (or our partners) may use cookies and tracking technologies to obtain your personal information); and
* **we collect from other sources and partners** (e.g., when we purchase personal information about you from a third party to better personalize your experience or market to your interests).

The types of personal information we obtain include:

* **contact information,** such as your name, postal address and/or zip code, email address, and telephone/mobile number; we may also collect your child’s name and date of birth from you;
* **account information,** such as your username and password (e.g., if you choose to create an account on the Site);
* **purchase history information,** such as when you make a purchase from us or our partners;
* **loyalty and rewards information,** such as when you sign up for loyalty programs;
* **characteristics and attributes,** such as age ranges, languages spoken, and marital and family status either collected by us or our partners;
* **preferences, such as hobbies,** interests, shopping preferences, and product propensity scores (e.g., likelihood of purchasing products) either collected by us or our partners;
* **online or technical information,** such as device, browser, mobile application, system and internet protocol addresses, and identifiers; and
* **inferred information,** such as information derived from the information listed in this section.

**Sensitive Personal Information.** For the purposes of processing listed in this Policy, we (or our partners) may collect and process sensitive personal information. This may include information such as your race, ethnicity, date of birth, or data related to your use of our Site or products such as pregnancy, allergies (e.g., allergy trigger quizzes), menstruation (e.g., period calculators), or incontinence. We may also make inferences about your preferences, behaviors, characteristics, health, or attributes related to your use of our Site or products. When we collect data that may be considered “sensitive”, we (or our partners) will request your consent to process such sensitive personal information and we may provide other controls (like an opt-out of certain processing), when required by law. Please note that certain portions of the Site may require this data for us to fully provide our services, so your choice to not provide such information may limit the scope of available offerings. We respect our customers’ rights and heightened privacy interests pertaining to sensitive personal information. As such, we commit to verifying that law enforcement entities follow the laws and procedures in their jurisdictions before we respond to a request for such information. Even when compliant with the laws of the requesting agency’s jurisdiction, we may make reasonable challenges to such requests.

What We Do With Your Information
--------------------------------

**Purposes of Processing.** We collect, process, and disclose your personal information only for specific and limited purposes. For example, we may process your personal information across all Kimberly-Clark brands to:

* develop, provide and improve our products, services, communication methods, and the functionality of our Site;
* process requests and manage our business needs regarding the products, offers and services we provide; this also includes responding to your questions and verifying your identity when necessary when you contact us;
* provide personalized experiences, transactional and marketing communications, and targeted advertising including special offers and recommendations to you;
* better understand your interests and create profiles by analyzing information about your attributes, characteristics, and behaviors for internal research; and to establish, deliver and measure advertising/marketing campaigns to you or to people like you;
* secure and protect your personal information and our interests; this includes preventing and investigating illegal activities, fraud and violations of our Terms of Use policies and other service conditions; and
* comply with legal requirements, including cooperating with law enforcement, government authorities, or governmental mandate (but when we do, we will disclose only the minimum amount of information required by law).

**Legal Bases.** Additionally, certain data protection laws require us to have a “legal basis” and defined purpose before processing any personal information about you. Our legal bases for which we may process your personal information may include:

* to establish or perform the contract we are about to enter (or have entered) into with you;
* for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) which will not override your interests and fundamental rights; this includes many of purposes of processing listed above;
* with your consent; this includes, for example, to personalize, deliver and measure certain direct marketing and advertising communications concerning our products and services; our communications may be sent by both non-automated and automated means (e.g., email, social media messages, SMS, MMS, automated dialing systems, or calls by human operators); and/or
* where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation and/or respond to requests from public and government authorities. This may include disclosing your information to law enforcement agencies or as required to comply with laws or regulations (including antifraud laws, money laundering, or tax laws) as well as transferring your personal information in connection with any potential or actual merger or sale of assets as part of a corporate transaction. When we process personal information on this basis, consistent with this Policy, we carefully review each request to ensure it is valid and that the requestor is entitled to the personal information they seek (and may challenge such requests as appropriate).

Who We Share Information With
-----------------------------

We may share information about you with our brands as well as third parties in certain circumstances including in the following situations:

* **Sharing Your Information with Service Providers.** We may share personal information with companies or individuals that provide us with services. These services may include, among other things, helping us to provide services to you; to create or maintain our databases; process payments; prepare and distribute communications; or to respond to inquiries;
* **Other Third Parties and Partners.** To better tailor your experiences and interests for advertising and marketing, your personal information may also be used by us or shared with partners, advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, social media networks, analytics companies and similar third parties. These third parties and their websites, platforms, and applications generally have their own privacy policies and terms of use. We encourage you to read them before using those websites and services;
* **Blogs, Online Postings, and Testimonials.** You may share comments, posts, testimonials, or other information on certain forums such as our Sites or social media networks. If you choose to do so, this information may be generally available to the public and read by others who access these forums. Again, third parties and their websites, platforms, and applications generally have their own privacy policies and terms of use and you should review those notices prior to using those sites;
* **Deidentified Information.** We may share deidentified information (e.g., aggregated or grouped information) that doesn’t identify you personally with third parties for research or other purposes identified in this Policy. When we share this information, we require these third parties to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals;
* **Law Enforcement and Legal Reasons.** Subject to applicable contractual restrictions and other internal procedures limiting disclosures to law enforcement (discussed above), we also may disclose personal information (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) in response to requests by government agencies (such as law enforcement or regulatory authorities); (3) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (4) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss or to protect your other vital interests; or (5) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity;
* **Business Transactions.** We reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution, or liquidation); and/or
* **International Data Transfers.** We may transfer your personal information with our brands and trusted-third parties outside of the country or territory from where you reside. When these third countries do not offer the same level of data protection as your country, we (or our service providers or their contractors/sub-processors) take steps to make sure that there are adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information. For example, these adequate safeguards may include your consent or involve binding the third party transferring your personal information to a contract that requires the same level of standards as the country from which the data was collected. In addition, we comply with certain national or country “localization” laws that, among other things, require personal information about their residents to be collected, processed and/or stored inside the country before being transferred internationally.

Washington Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy
----------------------------------------------

This portion of our Policy only applies to Washington state residents.

As a Washington resident, the Washington State My Health My Data (MHMD) Act gives you certain choices regarding your health data, as described below. The law applies only to “consumer health data” about your past, present, or future health condition.

### Consumer Health Data We Collect

We collect data from a variety of sources. Because consumer health data is defined very broadly, many of the categories of data we collect could also be considered consumer health data. Examples of consumer health data we collect may include:

* Information about your health-related conditions, symptoms, status, diagnoses, testing, or treatments. For example, your use of our products (such as those for pregnancy, allergies, menstruation, or incontinence) may give us insight into your health status. We also collect health information when you interact with our website through allergy trigger quizzes, period calculators, and similar offerings. These surveys and calculators give us additional insight into your health status.
* Behavioral biometrics resulting from your use of our websites. Data collected may include pages visited, actions taken (button clicks, products purchased, files downloaded, samples ordered, searches performed, and other actions taken), and keystrokes.
* Information that could identify your propensity to seek health care services or information, e.g., likelihood to seek treatment for allergies.
* Inferences derived from the above data.

### Sources of Consumer Health Data

We collect personal data (which may include consumer health data) from three main sources:

* You provide us this information directly when you purchase products, sign up for newsletters, fill out surveys (such as the period calculator or allergy quiz), enter promotions, or register for an account on our website.
* We collect some of this information automatically when you browse our website or interact with us online.
* We may collect consumer health information from other sources and partners, such as when we purchase information about you from a third party to personalize your experience or market to your interests.

### Why We Collect and Use Consumer Health Data

We collect and use consumer health data as reasonably necessary to provide you with the products and/or services you have requested and to market to your interests. Providing requested products and services to you may include delivering the products, making suggestions about what products are appropriate for you, and/or personalization of certain product features. We also use consumer health data to improve our products and for other essential business operations, such as analyzing our performance, meeting legal obligations, and conducting research and development.

We may also use consumer health data to market or advertise our own products and services. We may also use your purchase history or information received from third parties to advertise other products we sell that we think may be of interest to you.

For marketing and advertising, we give you choices and/or obtain your consent as required by law. Please see the “How to Exercise Your Rights” section below and the “Your Rights and Choices” section of the Global Privacy Policy for more details on the controls and choices you may have.

### Disclosures of Consumer Health Data

We may share each of the categories of consumer health data described above with your consent or as reasonably necessary to provide our products and services.

We may also share your information with service providers who operate on our behalf to help us provide you with products and services you have requested, to make product improvements, and to market and advertise our products and services to you.

### Processors and other Third Parties with whom We Share Consumer Health Data

As necessary for the purposes described above, we may share consumer health data with the following categories of third parties. More detail on each category is available in “Who We Share Information With” section of the Global Privacy Policy above:

* Service Providers.
* Third Parties and Partners. Your consumer health information may be shared with partners, advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, social media networks, analytics companies, and similar companies who process the information on our behalf as stated in the “Why We Collect and Use Consumer Health Data” section above.
* Parties to a Business Transaction, such as a corporate merger.
* Government Agencies and Law Enforcement.
* Other third parties. In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to provide data to other third parties, for example, to comply with the law or to protect our rights or those of our customers.

### How to Exercise Your Rights

Washington’s MHMD Act provides certain rights with respect to consumer health data. These rights include your right to access your consumer health data and receive a list of all third parties and affiliates—including contact information—who receive your health data. You also have the right to request that we delete our consumer health data. You can withdraw consent relating to the collection and sharing of your data too, subject to certain exceptions.

You can request to exercise such rights using the information described in the ["How to Contact Us"](#howtocontact) section of the Global Privacy Policy.

If your request to exercise a right under the MHMD Act is denied, you may appeal that decision by contacting our Global Privacy Officer. If your appeal is unsuccessful, you can raise a concern or lodge a complaint with the Washington State Attorney General at [www.atg.wa.gov/file-complaint.](https://www.atg.wa.gov/file-complaint)
