### **HOW CAN YOU REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT?**

You may be required to register with the Site in order to access our services. You agree to keep your password confidential, and will be responsible for all use of your account and password.

To register for our Site, you will need a valid email address, a computer or other multimedia device with installed software that allows you to browse websites (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari), with access to the Internet, and using a browser that supports cookies in accordance with our Cookie Policy. We recommend you print out and retain records and notices in paper form or some form of electronic storage, since these are important documents.

By using the Site, you represent and warrant that:

* All registration information you submit will be true, accurate, current and complete

* You have the legal capacity (in other words, you are not under the age of 18 or a minor pursuant to the laws of your country of residence) and you agree to comply with these Terms and Conditions

### **HOW CAN YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT OR DEACTIVATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION?**

You can deactivate your subscription by logging in and clicking on the ‘My Account’ link located in the upper right-hand menu. If you have questions or problems deactivating your subscription, please [Contact Us](https://resumegenius.com/contact). Once your subscription is cancelled, you will only be able to view your documents and you will not be able to download, print or edit them. If you wish to delete your account, you can make a data deletion request by clicking on [this link](https://resumegenius.com/data-access/personal-data/). Once your account is deleted or you delete some of its content, it will no longer be visible to other users. Nonetheless, if other users previously made a digital copy or saved it on their computer, we will not be able to access and delete that information. To the extent permitted by law, there may be content that we create for you and that may not be deleted once uploaded. Even when you delete your account or your personal information is deleted from our systems, we may retain some information for legitimate internal business purposes. This information may not be accessed again by you or third parties within the Service. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current paid term.

If you are an EU resident, by accepting these Terms and Conditions you understand and accept the use of our services immediately. You also understand that you are hereby waiving your right to withdraw from these Terms and Conditions.

**4\. WHAT PAYMENTS ARE ACCEPTED AND HOW ARE THEY PROCESSED?**
--------------------------------------------------------------

### **OUR POLICY ON PURCHASES AND ACCEPTED PAYMENT METHODS**

Charges for our services shall be paid via credit or debit card, or other means agreed between a user and us. Charges incurred on a periodic basis are charged in advance and shall be subject to automatic renewal. We may change prices at any time providing you with an option to cancel the subscription before it occurs. Users agree to such automatic renewals and charges to users’ credit or debit card, or other payment mechanism, without requiring prior authorization in each instance, subject to users cancelling their accounts.

In the event of any failure by a user to make payment, the user will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including lawyers’ fees) incurred by us in collecting such amounts. We reserve the right to suspend performance of the services for which a user fails to make timely payment hereunder or under any other agreement with us. If the total recurring amount due cannot be charged due to insufficient funds, you hereby authorize us to make a partial charge of the available balance. The rest of the amount due will be charged as a separate transaction to either the same card or any other card on file. Users shall be responsible for all taxes due on the sale of the services to a user, including interest and penalties thereon (exclusive of taxes based on the Site’s net income), which taxes shall include, without limitation, any direct or indirect local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes. If you are located in the US, your payments may be processed by Tripod Jet, LLC. If you are located outside of the US, your payments may be processed by Sonaga Tech Limited, Hamilton, Zweigniederlassung, Luzern, Switzerland.

You agree to pay all charges that are displayed at the time of purchase, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon placing your order. You agree that our third-party vendors may store your payment information. If your order is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until such time as you cancel the applicable order. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we have already requested or received payment.

We reserve the right to refuse any order placed through the Site. We may limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same payment method, and/or orders that use the same billing or shipping address. Also, we may offer different prices depending on the type of experience you wish to go through and the tools available. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.

Because of exchange rates, your transaction may be subject to differences in prices, depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued. We will not make any compensation or reimbursement for charges imposed by your bank or card issuer, including for any foreign currency exchange rates.

You may cancel your subscription at any time without additional charges, and the cancellation will take an effect at the end of the current billing period. Remaining part of the subscription remains active and is not refundable. Once the current billing period ends, the subscription expires, and you no longer have full access to the Site.

ResumeGenius.com may provide a full refund to customers who are still within their 14-day subscription term. Customers who wish to redeem a refund must contact customer service prior to the end of their trial subscription term either by calling customer support at (866) 215-9048, emailing support@resumegenius.com or by using live chat via resumegenius.com.

-----------------------------------

These Terms and Conditions and your use of the Site and the services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

### **DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

#### **Informal negotiations**

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a “Dispute” and collectively the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

#### **Binding arbitration**

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. You understand that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.

The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in New York County, New York, United States of America. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the state of New York, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

#### **EU residents**

Regulation No. 524/20143 may provide a right for an out-of-court settlement. Company is neither obliged nor willing to participate in an out-of-court Dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board. Your statutory rights regarding choice of law and venue remain unaffected. You can find more information by clicking [here](https://resumegenius.com/terms-of-use).

#### **Residents outside of the US**

Also remember to update your contact information, since we will reply to your request using the most recent information we have on file. Once received, we will try to provide resolution within 60 days. There may be times when the resolution options provided may not satisfy your needs, in that case, this agreement does not limit your rights to start a separate complaint process.

#### **Restrictions**

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law:

* No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding
* There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures
* There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought by a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons

Exceptions to informal negotiations and arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration:

* Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party
* Any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use
* Any claim for injunctive relief
* If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court
