Terms and Conditions
====================

\[Last Updated October 7, 2024\]

Welcome to Best Buy. The BestBuy.com website, the mobile Best Buy site, Best Buy customer support lines and email addresses, and any Best Buy app (Android and iOS) are collectively the “Best Buy Properties” and each individually is a “Best Buy Property.” By using any Best Buy Property and its related services, products, and software (“Products”) in any way, including to (i) purchase Products, (ii) apply for available financing options to be used to purchase Products, or (iii) contact Best Buy for customer support, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions (“Terms”). You also accept the Terms when you create an account, make a purchase as a guest, or log in to any Best Buy Property. Additional or separate terms may apply to your interactions with other Best Buy websites, Best Buy or Geek Squad® locations, and to your use of individual services or features available on a Best Buy Property, such as reviews. To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Terms, the provisions of the additional terms will govern. References to “Best Buy”, “Geek Squad”, “Magnolia”, “Magnolia Home Theater”, “Magnolia Design Center”, “Premium”, “Premium Home Theater”, “Premium Design Center”, “Premium Audio & Video”, “Pacific Sales”, “our”, “we”, or “us” may refer to Best Buy Co., Inc., BestBuy.com, LLC, Best Buy Stores, L.P., BBY Solutions, Inc., Best Buy Enterprise Services, Inc., Magnolia Hi-Fi, LLC, Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, LLC, and their affiliates, subsidiaries, and designees. We may make changes to any Best Buy Property and the Terms at any time and without notice to you. It is your responsibility to review the Terms for updates or changes. If any provision of or change to these Terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any other changes or conditions. If you do not agree with the Terms, you should not use the Best Buy Properties.

THESE TERMS INCLUDE A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER THAT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT. PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION BELOW.

Privacy
-------

Your use of the Best Buy Properties is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/privacy-policy/pcmcat204400050062.c?id=pcmcat204400050062). Please review the policy for more on how we collect and use information.

See Disclosure Information on the Best Buy Properties
-----------------------------------------------------

We try to be as accurate as possible with the information we present on the Best Buy Properties. We will make reasonable efforts to accurately display or communicate the attributes of the Products we sell. The information displayed on the Best Buy Properties, or shared with you as part of your interactions with the Best Buy Properties, such as through the use of chat, may be created or provided to you by artificial intelligence software (“AI”). AI used on or in connection with the Best Buy Properties to provide you with ideas, inspiration, summary information, or other contextual information, including those in response to topics or questions you input, is provided solely for your convenience and may not always be accurate. We do not warrant that Product descriptions or other content, whether generated by AI or not, is accurate, complete, or error free. Any use of AI or other technologies on or in connection with the Best Buy Properties, including chat-based or conversation-based technologies, regarding any of our terms and conditions (including these Terms), policies, or practices is provided solely for your convenience, and any deviation, contradiction, additional, or different term provided shall be void and non-binding and instead the applicable terms and conditions, policy, or practice shall control. Prices and promotions are subject to change and may vary from those offered in our stores. We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, sometimes an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we may contact you for instructions on the order.

Paying for your order
---------------------

Generally, we’ll charge your payment method for an item when we ship the item to you or confirm its availability in store. For digital items, we’ll charge your payment method when you initiate the download of the item or when the item is placed in your account and available for use. For special-delivery items, we’ll charge your payment method when you confirm a delivery time. However, we will preauthorize your order amount (including for pre-orders) with your payment method at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. If a preauthorization of a pre-order expires before fulfillment, the preauthorization will be reversed and another preauthorization will be made closer to the confirmed availability date.

Order confirmation
------------------

Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address you provide to us. If we cancel all or part of an order that we’ve already charged you for, we’ll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.

My Best Buy® Program
--------------------

When you create an account on a Best Buy Property, we will automatically enroll you in the My Best Buy program. The My Best Buy program is a free program through which you may receive membership benefits. If you are also a My Best Buy Credit Cardmember you will also be eligible to earn points toward reward certificates, which are coupons for discounts on future purchases at Best Buy. [See My Best Buy Program Terms](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/my-best-buy/my-best-buy-program-rules/pcmcat311100050001.c?id=pcmcat311100050001).

Dispute resolution by binding individual arbitration
----------------------------------------------------

ANY DISPUTE INVOLVING YOU AND BEST BUY OR ANY OF ITS AGENTS MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS FOLLOWS:

* ANY DISPUTE FALLING WITHIN THE JURISDICTIONAL SCOPE AND AMOUNT OF AN APPROPRIATE SMALL CLAIMS COURT MUST BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; AND
* ANY DISPUTE TO SEEK TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.

“Dispute” shall be interpreted broadly and cover any claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way whatsoever to your relationship or interaction with Best Buy, its agents, and its present and future subsidiaries, affiliates, and designees – including, but not limited to, GreatCall, Lively™, Geek Squad®, Magnolia®, and Pacific Sales® – whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. Examples of relationships or interactions giving rise to a covered claim include, without limitation: (1) your use of Best Buy’s websites; (2) your membership in any Best Buy loyalty or rewards program (e.g., My Best Buy®) or subscription-based services (e.g., My Best Buy Plus™ or My Best Buy Total™); (3) your receipt of delivery, repair or installation services or consultation services provided by Best Buy or its agents; (4) any communications between you and Best Buy; (5) application for financing; and/or (6) your purchase of Products offered, sold, or distributed by Best Buy including, but not limited to, any Dispute arising from the advertising of, or the sales practices related to, such Products. If you are a My Best Buy® member, Dispute shall also include all disputes that arose before your enrollment in, and after the cancellation or termination of, the My Best Buy® program, including any claims that are the subject of a purported class action litigation.

BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE DISPUTES. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, LESS DISCOVERY, AND LIMITED APPELLATE REVIEW. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.

Before either Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding, you and Best Buy agree to engage in a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute informally for 60 days, unless that time is extended by agreement.  If you intend to initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must first send a fully completed notice of your Dispute (the “Notice”) to Best Buy. The Notice must include your name and contact information (address, telephone number, and email address) and information sufficient to enable Best Buy to identify any transaction at issue.  The Notice must also include a detailed description of (1) your Dispute; (2) the specific facts supporting your claim(s); (3) the nature and basis of the damages you claim to have suffered; and (4) a calculation and explanation of the relief sought.  Your Notice shall be personally signed by you and sent to Best Buy at CT Corporation System, Inc., 1010 Dale Street North, St. Paul, MN 55117-5603 or by email at Arbitration@BestBuy.com.  If Best Buy intends to initiate an arbitration proceeding, it will send a Notice to you at the contact information we have on file.  If requested by Best Buy as part of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process, you agree to personally participate (along with your counsel, if you are represented) in a telephone conference to discuss the potential resolution of the Dispute between you and Best Buy.  If the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the Notice (or the longer period agreed to by the Parties), you or Best Buy may proceed with individual arbitration (this informal process is a condition precedent to doing so.).  If the sufficiency of a Notice or compliance with this mandatory informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it may be decided by a court at either Party’s election, and any formal dispute resolution proceeding shall be stayed pending resolution of the issue.  A court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in this informal process.

If the Parties are not able to resolve the Dispute through the mandatory informal dispute resolution process referenced above, either Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending a demand to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) that describes the nature and basis for the claim and includes all of the information required in the Notice.  The Party initiating arbitration must include as part of the demand a personally signed certification of compliance with the informal dispute resolution process.  You may serve a copy of a demand on our registered agent CT Corporation System, Inc., 1010 Dale Street North, St. Paul, MN 55117-5603. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s applicable Consumer Arbitration Rules or Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as appropriate, and as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and the form for filing an arbitration claim are available at www.adr.org. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution section, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the Parties that will administer the arbitration consistent with it.  If the Parties cannot agree on a provider, one shall be selected by a court that will administer the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution section.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules; however, Best Buy will consider reimbursing the consumer portion of the AAA fees upon a showing of financial hardship.

The Parties shall be responsible for their own attorney’s fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law or the arbitrator determines that a claim or proceeding was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitrator shall apply the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of the award. 

You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, virtually, based on written submissions, or at an in person hearing in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location.  Best Buy reserves the right to request a hearing from the arbitrator.  You agree to personally appear at any in person hearing (along with your counsel if you are represented).   

YOU AND BEST BUY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS MEANS THAT YOU MAY NOT PURPORT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OR ANY OTHER PERSON. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. Further, unless both you and Best Buy agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a court determines that a claim for public injunctive relief may not be waived and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted, then the Parties agree that any claim for public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. If this specific paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver) shall be null and void.

This paragraph sets forth additional procedures that apply to mass arbitrations.  If twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against Best Buy by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, you understand and agree that these additional procedures apply and that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed.  Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Best Buy shall each select fifteen (15) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process.  Each of these thirty (30) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator.  The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of this bellwether process. If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial thirty (30) proceedings after conferring in good faith, each side shall select another fifteen (15) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process. Each of these thirty (30) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator.  The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. A single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the Parties agree otherwise. Identical sets of arbitrators shall not be assigned to sets of bellwether proceedings.  This staged process shall continue with thirty (30) cases in each set of bellwether proceedings, consistent with the parameters identified above, including that the remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed, until all the claims included in these coordinated filings, including your case, are adjudicated, settled, or otherwise resolved. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to these additional procedures that apply to mass arbitrations from the time of the first cases are selected for a bellwether process until the time your case is selected for a bellwether process, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved.  You and Best Buy agree to engage in this process in good faith. A court shall have the authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against Best Buy.

If for any reason a claim may proceed in court rather than in arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, UNLESS SUCH WAIVER IS UNENFORCEABLE. THIS MEANS THAT ANY CLAIM WOULD BE DECIDED BY A JUDGE, NOT A JURY.

This dispute resolution provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. It shall survive any termination or cancellation of, or your participation in, any membership programs or subscription services and your relationship with Best Buy. Any amendments to this dispute resolution provision shall not affect any then active or pending arbitration proceeding.

Applicable law
--------------

THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW (OR IN THE ABSENCE OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THEN THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA), WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, WILL GOVERN THESE TERMS AND APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES AGAINST BEST BUY.
