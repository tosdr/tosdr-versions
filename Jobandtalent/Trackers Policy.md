The purpose of this Cookie Policy (hereinafter referred to as the **"Policy"**) is the regulation of the terms and conditions for the installation of cookies through the website [https://www.jobandtalent.com](https://www.jobandtalent.com/) (hereinafter referred to as the **"Website"**), owned by Jobs and Talent S.L. (hereinafter referred to as **"JT"**), as well as establishing terms and conditions for the installation of cookies in the user's browser (hereinafter referred to as the **"User"**).

Definition and function of cookies
----------------------------------

A cookie is a file that is downloaded to the user's browser. Cookies allow a website to, among other things, store and retrieve information about the browsing habits of a user or their computer. In general, these technologies can serve very different purposes. Depending on the information they contain and the way you use your computer, they can be used, for example, to recognise the user, obtain information on the user's browsing habits, personalise the way content is displayed, record your activity on the Website, allow you to navigate more smoothly and personally, or provide you with additional functionalities such as the display of videos or interactive graphics.

Types of cookies used by the Website
------------------------------------

The following types of cookies are installed by this Website:

* **Essential cookies:** They are required for the operation of the Website and they allow the user to use the website safely and securely. 
    
* **Functional cookies:** They allow the user to use the website with some preferences. 
    
* **Analytical cookies:** They allow us to quantify the number of users and thus to carry out the measurement and statistical analysis of the use made by users of the service offered. 
    
* **Advertising Cookies:** They allow us to store information on the behaviour of users, which allows a specific profile to be drawn up based on their browsing habits in order to show them targeted and appropriate advertising based on their preferences. These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform other functions, such as preventing the same ad from appearing repeatedly.
    

**Legitimacy and retention periods of the cookies that are installed in your browser**

When you enter our website, a cookie warning will be activated which will allow the user to accept the installation of all the cookies according to their preferences. Therefore, they will be able to accept all the cookies used by the website or, on an individual basis, by clicking on the "Configure Cookies" tab, to authorise the installation of those cookies that are of interest to them. 

Likewise, we inform you that the information obtained through cookies will be renewed with your consent, based on the applicable laws and regulations. 

**Browser cookie settings**

The User can set up their browser in order not to accept cookies, to block them and, if applicable, to delete them. In addition to this, the User can revoke a consent previously given to install cookies at any given time. Below you will find the steps the User should follow in order not to authorise cookies, to disable or to block cookies in different web browsers:

* Internet Explorer: Tools -> Internet Options -> Privacy -> Settings.
    
* Firefox: Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> History -> Custom Settings.
    
* Chrome: Settings -> Advanced -> Privacy -> Content Settings.
    
* Safari: Preferences -> Security.
    

What other technologies do we use?
----------------------------------

In addition to cookies, we use other common tracking technologies to process device access and other usage data. In this way we can find out how our offer is generally used by our users. We use identifiers such as web beacons (invisible pixel tags to measure the interaction between the user and the app) or software development kits (SDKs). For example, we can find out which content and topics are particularly popular, when our app is most frequently used, from which regions our app is used and which operating systems and devices our users generally use.

You can reset your device before or after using our app, so that the entire processing of usage data is rejected. If you wish to object to the analysis of the usage data, the use of the analysis data can be changed in the general settings of your device. However, if you deactivate these analysis procedures, it is possible that our app will not function properly.

Our legal basis for processing usage data with non essential cookies, SDKs and similar technologies is Art. 6 (1) lit. a) DSGVO (your consent).

More SDKs in our App
--------------------

We also use SDKs in our app to provide our services and to pseudonymously record the behaviour of users based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a) DSGVO.
