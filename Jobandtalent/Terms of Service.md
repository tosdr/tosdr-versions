4\. Obligations of the Applicant
--------------------------------

When you sign up as an Applicant, you undertake to use the platform and the services which can be accessed through it diligently, subject to the law, to a good conduct and to these General Terms of Use and, when applicable, to the particular terms and conditions which may be applicable when requesting specific services.

Job&Talent makes the use of most of its services conditional to the prior filling of the corresponding Applicant sign-up form in the platform. When signing up, you shall select an identifier (ID or login) and a password, and you undertake to keep it and use it with due diligence.

This password is personal and non-transferrable, and its transfer to third parties, even if it is temporary, is not allowed. In this respect, the Applicant shall take all the necessary measures in order to guard their password, preventing it from being used by third parties. Thus, the Applicant is solely responsible for the use of their password and otherwise Job&Talent shall be held harmless. If the Applicant knows or suspects their password is used by third parties, they shall notify Job&Talent as soon as possible.

When processing the sign-up information, the Applicant guarantees that he/she is over the minimum legal working age limit for the country where he/she is looking for a job, that he/she holds all necessary work permits and other authorizations and that he/she is authorized to enter into an employment relationship.

Regarding the SMS services or mobile notifications, the Applicant guarantees that he/she is the holder, subscriber or user of the declared mobile phones and he/she is responsible for communicating any change to Job&Talent or, if possible, to make changes himself/herself in his/her profile area.

In any case, the Applicant shall be solely responsible for the false or inaccurate statements made and for the damages caused to Job&Talent or to third-parties due to the information they provide.

The Applicant is expressly prohibited from carrying out the following actions, since they may endanger the normal continuity of the platform:

* Using mechanisms, software or scripts related to the use of the platform.
    
* Blocking, overwriting, modifying or copying, unless this is necessary for the correct use of the platform services. For instance, copying through search engine technologies such as "Robot/Crawler" is not necessary for the correct use of the platform services, and, thus, this is expressly prohibited.
    
* Revealing, reproducing or publicly communicating contents from the Job&Talent platform, from Applicants or third parties, without prior authorization from the rights holder.
    

Furthermore, it is not permitted to download, duplicate and/or distribute the platform and/or app as a whole or individual parts thereof. Technically induced duplication for browsing purposes is permitted, provided this action does not serve any commercial purposes, as well as permanent duplication for personal use.

The Applicant who intentionally or negligently breaches any of the previous obligations shall be responsible for all the damages they cause.
