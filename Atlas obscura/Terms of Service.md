When you use the Service to find places to visit, you should be aware that it is to be used for general planning purposes only. Atlas Obscura cannot guarantee that all information about locations is accurate, and information is not updated on a continuous basis to reflect changing conditions.

You agree that in conjunction with your use of the Service, you will not trespass, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be (“Private Property”).

There are many variables that must be considered prior to visiting, including: weather, fitness level, terrain features, and experience in similar situations in the past. Always exercise common sense and caution. Information on the Service about a location does not imply that accessing such location is safe or legal. Atlas Obscura makes no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding any such location or the accuracy, completeness or suitability of the information through the Service about such location. Visiting such locations can at times involve risk of injury, death, property damage, and other dangers associated with such activities.
