BY ACCESSING ANY PART OF THE SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED BELOW (THE "TERMS OF SERVICE") AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ATLAS OBSCURA [PRIVACY POLICY](https://www.atlasobscura.com/privacy)(THE "PRIVACY POLICY"), WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE ATLAS OBSCURA SERVICE. These Terms of Service apply to all users, including both users who are simply viewing the Service and users who are also contributors of content, information, and other materials or services on the Service.

You may use the Service solely for your personal, noncommercial use. You agree that you will not: (a) copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without Atlas Obscura's prior written authorization; or (b) alter or modify any part of the Service in any manner.

Visiting Places You Find on the Service
---------------------------------------

When you use the Service to find places to visit, you should be aware that it is to be used for general planning purposes only. Atlas Obscura cannot guarantee that all information about locations is accurate, and information is not updated on a continuous basis to reflect changing conditions.

You agree that in conjunction with your use of the Service, you will not trespass, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be (“Private Property”). You acknowledge that Atlas Obscura does not have and affirmatively disclaims any obligation or ability to provide you with complete and accurate information regarding the whereabouts of Private Property you may encounter when using the Service. Regardless of whether Atlas Obscura designates any content with a warning regarding its proximity to Private Property, you are solely responsible for obtaining all required permissions to approach or enter Private Property in connection with your use of the Service.

You agree to be mindful and respectful of places you visit in connection with your use of the Service. You agree that your behavior during any such visit will be appropriate to the environment around you and that you will not create excessive noise or other disturbances, or any unsafe conditions, in connection with your visit.

Visiting certain places that you learn about via the Service can be dangerous and may take you to difficult to access or potentially treacherous locations. There are many variables that must be considered prior to visiting, including: weather, fitness level, terrain features, and experience in similar situations in the past. Always exercise common sense and caution. Information on the Service about a location does not imply that accessing such location is safe or legal. Atlas Obscura makes no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding any such location or the accuracy, completeness or suitability of the information through the Service about such location. Visiting such locations can at times involve risk of injury, death, property damage, and other dangers associated with such activities. You understand that Atlas Obscura cannot and does not assume responsibility for any such personal injury, death, or property damage, all of which are at your own risk.
