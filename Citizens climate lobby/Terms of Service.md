[Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/ "Go to Citizens' Climate Lobby.") > Terms of Service

Citizens’ Climate Education (CCE) and Citizens Climate Lobby (CCL) (collectively, Citizens’ Climate or CC) jointly own and operate citizensclimatelobby.org, community.citizensclimatelobby.org and donate.citizensclimateeducationcorp.org (collectively, “the Website”).

### Terms of Service:

The following terms and conditions govern all use of the CC owned and operated websites and all content, services and products available at or through the websites.

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Website. By accessing or using any part of the Website, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Website or use any services made available through the Website. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by CCE, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. The Website is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old.

**Responsibility of Contributors.** If you post material, including links or comments, on the Website, (any such material, “Content”), you are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

* the posting, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
* if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
* you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
* the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;
* the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
* the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;
* you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by CC or otherwise; and
* your profile is not presented in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company.

By posting content on or through the Website, you give us the right to display and to distribute that content in connection with the Website. You also give other website users permission to share your Content and add their own Content to it.

If you delete Content, CC will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that due to caching the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, CC has the right (though not the obligation) to, in CC’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in CC’s reasonable opinion, violates any CC policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in CC’s sole discretion.

**Responsibility of Website Visitors.** CC has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects.By operating the Website, CC does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors.The Website may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated.

**Content Posted on Other Websites.** We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which the Website links, and that link to the Website.

You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. CC disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-CC websites and webpages.

**Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.** As CC asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.

* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address;
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

CC will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. CC will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of CC or others.

Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in California.

(“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will be construed so as to best effectuate the parties’ original intent. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.
