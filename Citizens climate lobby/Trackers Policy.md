### Advertising/Remarketing Cookies

We sometimes use tracking pixels to assist with our marketing and delivery of online advertising.

By better understanding what our audiences are interested in, we can more effectively promote our work.

The technology to do this is made possible by cookies and as such we may place a ‘remarketing cookie’ during your visit. We are unable to proactively reach out to you personally as the process is anonymized, but you can opt out of these cookies at any time.

The tracking pixels we currently use are for Facebook and Google Remarketing.
