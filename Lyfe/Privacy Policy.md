Privacy Policy
==============

TLDR:
-----

Hi there! Thank you for reading this page. We don't want you to spend your precious time, so here's a TLDR from founding team.

We understand how user privacy is important nowadays, especially for this kind of product. That's why we don't have any advertising partners and we don't plan to run any ads in the app and website.

We've connected Google analytics to the website, to collect general info about our visitors to better understand our potential customer base.

We've connected Firebase analytics to the app, to collect general info about our visitors to better understand our potential customer base.

On the app sign up we decided to only ask for your email - a decision was made to not ask for your age, gender, name, etc. After the thorough research, we've concluded that this data is not needed and does not affect the quality of app correlation analysis, ML algorithm, etc. We are asking for the email only so you can reset the password when needed, manage your subscription, receive notifications

WE DO NOT SELL NOR GIVE AWAY YOUR APP DATA TO ANYONE. THE DATA YOU'VE PROVIDED IN THE APP STAYS SECURELY ON LYFE SERVERS AND IS PROCESSED ONLY BY LYFE.

As a young developer team, we value your privacy, as much as we value ours. We want to create a safe and secure place for self improvement.

  
  

At Lyfe, accessible from [https://lyfe.ltd](https://lyfe.ltd/), one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Lyfe and how we use it.
