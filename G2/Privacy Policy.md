These tracking technologies, which are often referred to collectively as cookies, allow us to understand how users navigate to and around the Site, view different pages, access content and request services. We may use them, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information and collect general usage and volume statistical information.

4\. Reviews and Other Content Published on the Site
---------------------------------------------------

If you leave a review on the Site, or participate on a discussion board, your review(s) or comments will be publicly available on and off of the Site. Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service anonymously. Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Service are only private to the extent that both you and the recipient(s) of your messages keep them private. For example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it. We may access, review, and disclose such messages in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.

Submitting reviews and comments is entirely voluntary. By submitting reviews and comments, you grant G2 an authorization to publicly share them and sub-license the content according to our [Terms of Use](https://www.g2.com/terms-of-use). This means that we can authorize the providers of software products and services to share this content through their websites, social media sites, or other marketing materials, such as slide decks or case studies, and/or the operators of other publicly-available websites, social media sites, platforms, or mobile apps to republish this content.

If you posted an attributed review under your name, you can change your mind later, and we will anonymize or delete it. However, please understand that we cannot guarantee others did not store the personal information prior to the change, by printing or downloading the original post.

5\. Your Data Privacy Rights

#### Legal Basis for Processing (EEA, Switzerland and United Kingdom only)

Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only in the following circumstances:

* We have your express consent to do so;
* We need the personal data to perform a contract with you; or
* Processing is in our legitimate interests and is not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, to prevent, investigate or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations).

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will identify such basis for processing at the relevant time and let you know if the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences associated with not providing such information).

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate the Site, communicate with you in relation to your account or the Site, to solicit information from you, including through surveys, to share aggregated information with providers of listed products or services and other licensees of our research and report offerings, to measure interest in and improve our offerings and Site, to engage in marketing activities, and to otherwise customize your experience with G2.
