We want you to be aware that certain online tools exist to help us serve and recognize you when you visit the Site. We receive and store certain types of information when you visit the Site. When you access the Site, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be web beacons, cookies, clear gifs, pixel tags, e-tags, flash cookies, log files, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications. These tracking technologies, which are often referred to collectively as cookies, allow us to understand how users navigate to and around the Site, view different pages, access content and request services. We may use them, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information and collect general usage and volume statistical information. If you want to remove or block cookies, you may be able to update your browser settings. For more information about our use of cookies, and to adjust your cookie preferences on the Site, please review our [Cookie Policy](https://www.g2.com/cookie-policy).

Learn more in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.g2.com/cookie-policy).

4\. Reviews and Other Content Published on the Site
---------------------------------------------------

If you leave a review on the Site, or participate on a discussion board, your review(s) or comments will be publicly available on and off of the Site. Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service anonymously. Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Service are only private to the extent that both you and the recipient(s) of your messages keep them private. For example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it. We may access, review, and disclose such messages in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.

Submitting reviews and comments is entirely voluntary. By submitting reviews and comments, you grant G2 an authorization to publicly share them and sub-license the content according to our [Terms of Use](https://www.g2.com/terms-of-use). This means that we can authorize the providers of software products and services to share this content through their websites, social media sites, or other marketing materials, such as slide decks or case studies, and/or the operators of other publicly-available websites, social media sites, platforms, or mobile apps to republish this content.

If you posted an attributed review under your name, you can change your mind later, and we will anonymize or delete it. However, please understand that we cannot guarantee others did not store the personal information prior to the change, by printing or downloading the original post.

5\. Your Data Privacy Rights

#### Legal Basis for Processing (EEA, Switzerland and United Kingdom only)

Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only in the following circumstances:

* We have your express consent to do so;
* We need the personal data to perform a contract with you; or
* Processing is in our legitimate interests and is not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, to prevent, investigate or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations).

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will identify such basis for processing at the relevant time and let you know if the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences associated with not providing such information).

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate the Site, communicate with you in relation to your account or the Site, to solicit information from you, including through surveys, to share aggregated information with providers of listed products or services and other licensees of our research and report offerings, to measure interest in and improve our offerings and Site, to engage in marketing activities, and to otherwise customize your experience with G2.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at privacy \[at\] g2.com.

6\. Processing in the United States
-----------------------------------

If you are accessing the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your personal information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection laws of the United States may not be equivalent or as comprehensive as the data protection laws as those in your country.

Your personal information may be processed outside your jurisdiction, including in countries and jurisdictions that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission or your local legislature or regulator, and that may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. We ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or other applicable regulators or legislators. Where required by applicable law, we will only share, transfer or store your personal information outside of your jurisdiction with your prior consent.

We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy \[at\] g2.com.

7\. Data Privacy Framework
--------------------------

G2.com, Inc., including G2 subsidiaries Advocately, Inc. and Siftery, LLC comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  G2 has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  G2 has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework program Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit the [Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

In compliance with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles, G2 commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the DPF Principles.  European Union, Swiss and United Kingdom individuals with DPF inquiries or complaints should first contact G2 at privacy \[at\] g2.com.

G2 has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the DPF Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, Data Privacy Framework Services, operated by BBB National Programs. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit the [BBB website](https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/dpf-consumers/ProcessForConsumers) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.

If your  DPF complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke [binding arbitration](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/G-Arbitration-Procedures-dpf?tabset-35584=2) for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over G2’s compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF).

Pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, G2 may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

G2’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Data Privacy Framework and subsequent onward transfers to a third party is described in the Data Privacy Framework Principles. In particular, G2 remains responsible and liable under the Data Privacy Framework Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where G2 is not responsible for the events giving rise to the damage.
