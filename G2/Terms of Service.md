G2 Terms of Use
===============

_Last Updated on October 16, 2022._

Welcome to the G2.com, Inc. website. These terms, conditions, and notices (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the G2.com, Inc. website, including access and use through any other website or platforms or mobile applications, (“Site”).

Be sure to return to this page periodically to review the most current version of these Terms. We may modify these Terms or any additional terms that apply to this Site to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to this Site. We will notify you about material changes to these Terms by either sending a notice to the email address you provided to us and/or by placing a prominent notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions or features of this Site or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you should discontinue your use of this Site.

The terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “G2” refer to G2.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation located at 100 S. Wacker Drive, Suite 600, Chicago, IL 60606, United States. The term “you” refers to the person visiting this Site and/or contributing content on this Site. If you are accessing or using this Site on behalf of a business, that business accepts these Terms, and the term “you” also refers to that business.

Use of the Site
---------------

This Site allows you to search for and share information about technology products, services, and vendors, communicate with others, and/or create new content such as recommendations and reviews (both written and video). You also can connect with software providers and request demos of their products. Find out more about our vision \[here\](https://blog.g2crowd.com/about/). To make sure that reviews are unbiased, current and real, we have developed [Community Guidelines](https://www.g2.com/static/community_guidelines) and use different mechanisms to verify that you are who you say you are. However, you decide what information you want to share with the public, since you have the option to post your reviews anonymously, or not post any review at all.

As a condition of your use of this Site, you warrant that (i) all information supplied by you on this Site is true, accurate, current, and complete, (ii) if you have a G2 account (“Registered User”), you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you, and (iii) you are 18 years of age or older. G2 does not knowingly collect the information of anyone under the age of 18. We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Site and the content we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of these Terms.

Please be advised that all reviews, including any endorsements, of third-party products, services, or vendors contained on this Site are the opinions of the reviewers of those products, services, or vendors and not those of G2. As described in our [Community Guidelines](https://www.g2.com/static/community_guidelines), G2 from time to time may provide incentives (such as gift cards) to encourage visitors to this Site to submit reviews. Any such incentives, however, are not dependent on whether the review is positive or negative.

9. Content or links to content that, in the sole judgment of G2, (i) violates the previous subsections herein, (ii) is objectionable, (iii) restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Interactive Areas or this Site, or (iv) may expose G2 or its affiliates or its or their users and/or sublicensees to any harm or liability of any type.

Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of this Site in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or this Site.

Without limiting the foregoing, G2 takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted, stored, or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or damage thereto, nor is G2 liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography, or profanity you may encounter. As a provider of interactive services, G2 is not liable for any statements, representations, or content provided by its users in any public forum or other Interactive Area. Although G2 has no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, G2 reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, or edit, without notice, any Content posted or stored on this Site at any time and for any reason, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or store on this Site at your sole cost and expense.

AI-Powered Chatbot
------------------

G2’s Chatbots are designed to generate responses (“Outputs”) based on inputs or prompts (“Inputs”). G2 does not guarantee accuracy of any Output generated by a Chatbot. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, and AI, use of Chatbots may result in an erroneous or non-sensical Output, and as such, you should not assume the accuracy of any Output. Furthermore, Output may not be unique across users, and Chatbots  may generate the same or similar Output for other users. By using any of our Chatbots, you grant G2 and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, distribute, publish, create derivative works from, and publicly display throughout the world in any media, now known or hereafter devised, the Inputs and Outputs.

With respect to your use of any Chatbot, you agree to not:

1. mislead anyone that Output generated by the Chatbot is human-generated;
2. include in Inputs any personally identifiable information;
3. include in Inputs any content that expresses or promotes hate, harassment, or violence, exploits or harms children, encourages self-harm, presents illegal, sexual, political, harmful, false, deceiving or misleading information, misuses personal data, contains malware, unsolicited bulk content, ransomware, viruses, or other software;
4. include in your Inputs any content that violates a third-party’s contractual right;
5. use the Chatbot in a way that infringes, misappropriates or violates any third party rights;
6. use the Chatbot  for activities which have high risk of economic harm, for adult content and adult industries; offering tailored financial advice, to provide health advice, political campaigning or lobbying;
7. reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, translate otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying components of models, algorithms, and systems or the Chatbot  (except to the extent such restrictions are contrary to applicable law);
8. use the Chatbot to develop foundation models or other large-scale models that compete with G2 or OpenAI; or
9. use any method to extract data from the Chatbot , including scraping, harvesting, or web data extraction methods.

You agree that any engagement, written or otherwise, you have with G2’s Chatbots can be sold, distributed, or otherwise shared at G2’s sole discretion.  You acknowledge and agree that any engagement you have with any Chatbot  is not confidential and is the property of G2. [G2’s AI Terms & Conditions](https://legal.g2.com/g2-artificial-intelligence-terms-conditions) are incorporated into these Terms by reference.
