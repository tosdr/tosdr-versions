    **12.1  Election to Arbitrate.**

  

If you are located in the United States or any jurisdiction where this Section 12 is not prohibited, you and G2 agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for resolution of a Claim be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this Section 12 (“Arbitration Provision”) unless you opt-out as provided in Section 12.2 below. As used in this Arbitration Provision, “Claim” shall include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving you (or persons claiming through, affiliated with, or connected with you), on the one hand, and G2 (or persons claiming through, affiliated with, or connected with G2) on the other hand, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed, relating to or arising out of any products or services provided by G2 to you, any interactions or communications between or among you and G2, this Agreement, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from this Agreement, including (except to the extent provided otherwise in the last sentence of Section 12.8 below) the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims include matters arising as initial claims, counter‐claims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise. Please note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The scope of this Arbitration Provision is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is enforceable.

    **12.2  Applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act; Arbitrator’s Powers.**

  

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator shall take steps to reasonably protect confidential information.

    **12.3  Opt-Out of Arbitration Provision.**

  

You may opt out of this Arbitration Provision for all purposes by sending an arbitration opt-out notice to legal@g2.com, within 60 days of the date of your electronic acceptance of these Terms or the date you first used our products or services. The opt-out notice must clearly state that you are rejecting arbitration; provide your name, address, email address, and telephone number; and be signed by you. No other methods can be used to opt out of this Arbitration Provision. If the opt-out notice is sent on your behalf by a third party, such third party must include evidence of his or her authority to submit the opt-out notice on your behalf.

     **12.4  Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution.** 

  

If a Claim arises, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Before initiating any dispute or Claim in arbitration you must first provide G2 an opportunity to resolve any complaints by contacting us via support@g2.com with the subject line “Dispute Notice.”  Your Dispute Notice must contain the following information: (1) your name, (2) address, (3) the email address used with us, (4) if available, the confirmation or other number for the transaction that is the subject of the complaint, (5) the date, (6) a brief description of the nature of the complaint, and (7) the resolution sought (together, the “Required Information”). If your Dispute Notice does not contain all of the Required Information (or an explanation of why you are unable to include it), then the Dispute Notice shall be without effect and must be resubmitted before any arbitration or other legal action against us can be initiated. This requirement is intended to inform us that you have a complaint that may need resolution.  If we do not resolve the complaint within 60 days of the initiation of the Dispute Notice, you shall be entitled to seek relief as stipulated in this Arbitration Provision.

    **12.5  Arbitration Procedures.**

  

The party initiating arbitration shall do so with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) Chicago under JAMS Arbitration Rules & Procedures.  If, and only if, the JAMS declines for any reason to administer the arbitration or is otherwise unable to administer the arbitration for any reason, you agree that, alternatively, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).  The arbitration shall be conducted according to, and the location of the arbitration shall be determined in accordance with, the rules and policies of the administrator used, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or are prohibited by any countervailing law. You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms, and instructions for initiating an arbitration with JAMS by contacting the JAMS as follows: on the web at [JAMS: Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services |](https://www.jamsadr.com/) jamsadr.com or by writing to JAMS Chicago Resolution Center, 71 S. Wacker Drive, Ste. 3090, Chicago, IL 60606. You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms, and instructions for initiating an arbitration with the AAA by contacting the AAA as follows: on the web at [American Arbitration Association |ADR.org](http://www.adr.org/)  or by writing to American Arbitration Association, Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043.  In the case of a conflict between the rules and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision shall control if not prohibited by countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply. The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, who will be appointed by the administrator.  You agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language.  Any hearing will be conducted virtually unless the arbitrator determines that a party’s right to a fundamentally fair process would be impaired without an in-person hearing. In the case of an in-person hearing, such hearing will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or any other location we agree to.  You agree that, in the event of an in-person hearing, any \[Company\] employee, witness or representative who resides more than 150 miles from the location of the in-person hearing and who is participating in the hearing, may participate by telephone or video conference, and his or her physical presence shall not be required.  Ordinarily, pre-hearing information exchanges will be limited to the reasonable production of non-privileged documents directly relevant to the dispute. Unless the arbitrator determines that an additional form of information exchange is necessary to provide for a fundamentally fair process, those documents will be limited to your account records and communications directly related to the transactions between you and G2 that are the subject of your dispute. Any issues regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the arbitrator, and the arbitrator’s determination shall be conclusive.  Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither party may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.

    **12.6  Arbitration Fees.**

  

Each party will be responsible for its own initiation fees for arbitration, but if your entire Claim is for less than $1,000, G2 shall reimburse you for the filing fee upon written request for reimbursement with documentation of insufficient funds to pay the fee. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration would be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, G2 will pay as much of the fees and costs in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary in order to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation. If the mass arbitration fee schedule of the administrator applies, such fee schedule will take precedence over any other statement in these Terms to the extent required by the administrator. We shall pay the administrator’s hearing fees for one full day of arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that exceed one day will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator’s rules or applicable law require otherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so. Each party shall bear the fees and expenses for their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and for preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration, except as otherwise required by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

    **12.7  Arbitration Award and Appeals.** 

  

Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitration administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within 30 days after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any appeal shall be governed by this Arbitration Provision and the administrator’s rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not appealed, and any panel award on appeal, shall be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”), and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

    **12.8  No Class Actions.**

  

YOU AND G2 EACH AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT. The arbitrator will have the power to grant declaratory or injunctive relief, whether interim or final, only in favor of you individually and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by your individual claim without affecting other customers of G2. Nothing in these Terms will prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief separately from arbitration in court, and any such application will not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or as a waiver of the right to arbitrate your individual claims. You and we agree that any claims for damages and/or any relief other than public injunctive relief must be heard in arbitration first, with any claims seeking a remedy of public injunctive relief in court proceeding only after the arbitration of all arbitrable Claims, and any claims or portions of claims seeking a remedy of public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.  If you file a lawsuit in court seeking public injunctive relief before meeting the preconditions of the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution process or the agreement to arbitrate, you will be waiving your right to seek damages from G2 or its affiliates relating to any Claims governed by these Terms. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single transaction. In accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, or upon motion of one or more interested parties, and after providing all other interested parties an opportunity to be heard, the arbitrator, including any Process or Procedural Arbitrator, may, at their discretion, coordinate more than one arbitration proceeding initiated under this Arbitration Provision, in order to promote efficiency in discovery and to avoid inconsistent legal rulings. In the interest of clarity, any coordination under the preceding sentence will be limited only to currently-pending arbitrations initiated under this Arbitration Provision, and the arbitrator may not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. All parties will retain the right to request an individualized hearing. The Process or Procedural Arbitrator may, at their discretion, determine that any mass arbitration should proceed first by hearing and issuing decisions on a limited number of bellwether claimants followed by mediation of any remaining claimants before additional arbitration demands may be filed and, to facilitate the bellwether process, may enjoin the filing of additional arbitration demands or order that no such demands be accepted for filing pending completion of the bellwether hearings and mediation.  If an order is issued enjoining the filing of additional arbitration demands or providing that such demands not be accepted for filing by the administrator, then the statutes of limitations applicable to the claims in the arbitration demands that cannot be filed as a result of that order shall be tolled while the order is pending, and the duration of the order shall be no longer than one year. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this Section 12.8, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of the prohibition in this Section 12.8 from proceeding in arbitration on a class, representative or collective basis shall be determined exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.

    **12.9  Survival and Severability of Arbitration Provision.** 

  

This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than the prohibition on bringing class or collective actions in arbitration as set forth in Section 12.8 is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term, then that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that term) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be brought in court. If an arbitration is brought on a class, representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in Section 12.8 are finally adjudicated pursuant to the last sentence of Section 12.8 to be unenforceable, then no arbitration shall be had. In no event shall any invalidation be deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.

    **12.10  Judicial Forum for Claims.** 

  

Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that this Arbitration Provision is found not to apply to, or not be enforceable with respect to, you or your Claim, you and G2 agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Cook County, Illinois, USA, and, if any judicial proceeding is brought elsewhere, it shall be transferred to a court located in Cook County, Illinois, USA. Both you and G2 consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.

    **12.11  WAIVER OF RIGHT TO LITIGATE.** 

  

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY ANY PARTY.
