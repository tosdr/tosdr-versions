8\. MATERIALS SUBMITTED BY CUSTOMER

Any materials submitted by you, including, without limitation, photographs, videos, images, text, graphics and other materials (collectively, “User Submitted Materials”) are subject to the following terms and conditions:

* You will retain ownership of such User Submitted Materials, and you grant us and our designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, perpetual irrevocable right and license, with right of sublicense (through multiple tiers), to use, reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), create derivative works of and publicly display such User Submitted Materials solely in connection with the production or provision of any product or service you request or to show you how your User Submitted Materials would appear in our products or services. For example, when you place an order for a product, we will prepare, manipulate (if necessary), and transmit the User Submitted Materials for production, packaging and shipment. Similarly, if you want to share a photo book with your friends and family, we will accommodate your request by making your photographs available to your friends and family to download and/or to use and create projects of their own, and to purchase products with those photographs.
* Please note that, while you retain ownership of your User Submitted Materials, any template or layout in which you arrange or organize such User Submitted Materials through tools and features made available through any of our Sites and Apps are not proprietary to you, and the rights to such template or layout will remain with us.
* You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise possess all necessary rights with respect to the User Submitted Materials, and that the User Submitted Materials do not and will not infringe, misappropriate, use or disclose without authorization or otherwise violate any copyright, trademark, trade secret right or other intellectual property or other property right of any third party, and that the User Submitted Materials are not unlawful, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, hateful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, confusingly similar to brands or branded products sold by others or otherwise objectionable.
* You consent to the use of your likeness, and you have obtained the written consent, release, and/or permission of every identifiable individual who appears in User Submitted Materials to use such individual’s likeness, for purposes of using and otherwise exploiting the User Submitted Materials in the manner contemplated by these Terms, or, if any such identifiable individual is under the age of eighteen (18), you have obtained such written consent, release and/or permission from such individual’s parent or guardian (and you agree to provide to us a copy of any such consents, releases and/or permissions upon our request). If you do submit a submission that contains the likeness of an identifiable individual under the age of eighteen (18), we strongly encourage you not to include any identifying information (such as the individual’s name or address) with such User Submitted Materials.
* You agree that we may (but are not obligated to) filter any User Submitted Materials (including, without limitation, deleting or replacing expletives or other harmful or offensive language), refuse to use any User Submitted Materials (including, without limitation, suspending processing and shipping of any order relating to any User Submitted Materials) and/or disclose any User Submitted Materials and the circumstances surrounding the use thereof, to any third party in order to provide the applicable products or services, to enforce these Terms or to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.
* You agree to indemnify and hold us, our directors, officers, shareholders, employees, contractors, agents, representatives, affiliates, and third party users harmless from and against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, expenses and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) that arise directly or indirectly out of or from: (i) your violation of these Terms, any other agreement or terms of use with us, any representation or warranty contained herein or therein or any applicable law; (ii) your User Submitted Materials; (iii) your activities in connection with obtaining any products or services from us, or (iv) any activity related to access to or use of your account by you or any other person.
* User Submitted Materials that violate these Terms may be removed from our Sites and Apps; provided, however, that we have no obligation to remove User Submitted Materials in response to user reports or requests. We are not responsible for, and will have no liability for, the removal, non-removal or loss of any User Submitted Materials from our Sites and Apps. We recommend you keep back-up copies of your User Submitted Materials on your hard drive or other personal system.

9\. COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK ISSUES

While we are not obligated to review User Submitted Materials for copyright or trademark infringement, we are committed to protecting copyrights and trademarks and expect users of our Sites and Apps to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. It is Shutterfly’s policy, in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers or are repeatedly charged with infringement.

DMCA Take-Down Notice

If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through our Sites and Apps infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.

The notice must include the following information:

(a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);

(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on our Sites and Apps;

(d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party;

(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law (e.g., as a fair use); and

(f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

DMCA Counter-Notice

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [http://www.copyright.gov](http://www.copyright.gov/) for details.

A counter notice must include all of the following information:

* Your signature, which may be provided electronically by typing your name
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled. For listings, please provide the listing URL to each item before it was removed or disabled
* A statement made under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which you are located, or if your address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Shutterfly is located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification or an agent of such person

If you misrepresent that material is not infringing, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees). If you are not sure whether or not the material is infringing, please contact an attorney before submitting a counter notice. Fraudulent or abusive counter notices or other misuse of Shutterfly’s Intellectual Property Policy may result in account termination or other legal consequences.

15\. JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES

Our Sites and Apps are controlled and operated from the United States. Our Sites and Apps are not subject to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. We do not represent or warrant that any of our Sites and Apps, products, and/or services or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access Shutterfly do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the availability of our Sites and Apps, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.

16\. CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

**Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.**  These Terms and your relationship with Shutterfly (past, present and in the future) are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which you were billed for your purchase of the Shutterfly product or service that is subject to this Agreement, without regard to the state’s conflict of law provisions, and except to the extent preempted by or inconsistent with federal law. You and Shutterfly agree that if any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating in any way to the Shutterfly service or these Terms of Use has a statute of limitations in excess of two years, such claim or cause of action must be filed within two years after the claim or cause of action has accrued or it will be forever barred. To the extent any claim, cause of action, or request for relief is not subject to arbitration under Section 19 below, you and Shutterfly agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any State or Federal court located in the County of Santa Clara, California, United States of America, and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.

17\. MISCELLANEOUS

If any provision of these Terms, or the application thereof to any person, place or circumstance, will be or are held to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible, or, if incapable of such enforcement, will be deemed to be deleted from these Terms, and the remainder of these Terms and such provisions as applied to other persons, places and circumstances will remain in full force and effect. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default, nor will any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver of any right or remedy. This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicenseable by you except with our prior written consent. These Terms may not be modified or amended except as set forth in the introductory section of these Terms. Any heading, caption or section title contained in these Terms is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. If you have any questions or comments regarding these Terms, please contact: [legal@shutterfly.com](mailto:legal@shutterfly.com).

18\. TERMINATION

Either you or we may terminate your access to our Sites and Apps and to your account at any time, with or without cause, and with or without prior notice. Without limiting the foregoing, we may terminate your access if you violate these Terms. Upon termination for any reason, your right to access and/or use our Sites and Apps will immediately cease. Upon termination, you will have no further access to, and we may delete, any information, files or materials in or related to your account, including, without limitation, any User Submitted Materials. Upon termination, Shutterfly may delete all information, files and materials related to your account, including any User Submitted Materials, and we will have no obligation whatsoever to save or make any such information, files or materials available to you. You agree that we will have no liability whatsoever to you or any other party as a result of a termination of your access our Sites and Apps and to your account and/or as a result of the deletion or loss of any information, files or materials in or related to your account.

19\. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

**Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.**  If you are a Shutterfly customer in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Shutterfly agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to a Shutterfly product or service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, or your relationship with Shutterfly (past, present, or future) shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that **you and Shutterfly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action**. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Shutterfly account.

If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Shutterfly, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (“Notice”). The Notice to Shutterfly must be addressed to: General Counsel, Shutterfly, LLC, 10 Almaden Blvd., Suite 900, San Jose, CA 95113 (“Notice Address”). If Shutterfly initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Shutterfly, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific relief sought and the basis for the calculations;

(c) include your name, the email address associated with your Shutterfly account, your current phone number, mailing address, and email address, and your signature; and (d) if you have retained an attorney, your signed statement authorizing Shutterfly to disclose your confidential account records to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim. If Shutterfly and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or Shutterfly may (i) commence an arbitration proceeding or (ii) file a claim in small claims court for individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. Either party may also invoke any applicable arbitration rules allowing parties to elect a small claims court option for an individual dispute. The parties agree that the notice required by this Section is a material provision of these Terms.

You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/).

With the exception of “Mass Arbitrations,” as defined in the following paragraph, all arbitrations will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.  Unless Shutterfly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place virtually or in the county of your residence.

In the event 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and Shutterfly agree that the demands will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and Shutterfly agree that it shall not be governed by the AAA Rules or administered by the AAA. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”), a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed as modified by this Agreement, including the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules, but excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “NAM Rules”). The NAM Rules are available at www.namadr.com or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and Shutterfly agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or Shutterfly may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction compelling compliance with this agreement and compelling administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests to a court, you and Shutterfly agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. You and Shutterfly acknowledge that either party’s failure to comply with this paragraph would irreparably harm the other, and you and Shutterfly agree that a court may issue an order staying the arbitrations (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) until any disagreements over the provisions of this paragraph are resolved by the court, including any disagreements about the applicability of the Mass Arbitration process.

The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the rules of the applicable dispute resolution provider (i.e., the AAA Rules or the NAM Rules). Your and Shutterfly’s right to recover attorneys’ fees, costs and arbitration fees, shall be governed the laws that apply to the parties’ dispute, as well as any applicable arbitration rules.

YOU AND SHUTTERFLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If any provision of this paragraph is determined to be unenforceable with respect to any claim or any particular remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then the parties agree that the claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

#### **Shutterfly Video Plan**

Shutterfly Video Plan (“Video Plan”) is a subscription program designed to offer customers certain benefits from Shutterfly. With a membership to the Video Plan, members are entitled to the benefits outlined below, subject to the requirements and limitations of these Terms. If you register for membership in the Video Plan or use the Video Plan, you accept these Terms.

Video Plans allow for the storage and playback of video files (“Video Content”). The fees for Video Plans will vary depending on storage capacity and other features. A fuller description of the Video Plan service features and pricing associated with each plan type is available at  [https://support.shutterfly.com/s/article/video-plans](https://support.shutterfly.com/s/article/video-plans).

If you exceed the limits of your plan, you may be prevented from adding more video content, and you will be prompted to upgrade your plan. You may upgrade your plan at any time by accessing the “Settings” section of the “Shutterfly Photos” area of the Site (photos.shutterfly.com). You may also downgrade your plan at any time by contacting customer support at our [Help Center](https://support.shutterfly.com/s/). If you downgrade your plan, you may be unable to upload video content in excess of the limits of your downgraded plan and may no longer have access to certain features. In the event that you continue to have video content in excess of the limits for your plan level, you will be prompted to either upgrade your plan or delete video content to free up storage. If you do not delete sufficient video content, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your plan.

By enrolling in the Video Plan, you expressly allow us to charge a fee to the payment method (“Payment Method”) you selected during purchase (or to a different Payment Method if you change your billing information) at the then-current rate, and any other charges or taxes that may apply in connection with your use of the service. As used in these Terms, “billing” will indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. You will be billed at the start of your Video Plan and each year thereafter, unless and until you cancel your subscription. In the event we are unable to charge an applicable renewal fee to your Payment Method for more than thirty (30) days after the beginning of a renewal term of your subscription to the Video Plan, Shutterfly reserves the right to terminate, suspend or restrict your membership in the Video Plan. In such event, you may no longer be allowed to upload additional Video Content. You agree that it is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method up-to-date. We expressly reserve the right to suspend or terminate your membership and subscription in the event we are unable to charge to your Payment Method. Go to “My Plan” in the “Settings” section of the Shutterfly Photos area on the Site ([photos.shutterfly.com](https://photos.shutterfly.com/)) and click on the “Billing” tab to see the date for your next renewal period.

If you are currently enrolled in an annual Video Plan, we will inform you by email before automatically renewing your Video Plan. Each Video Plan will renew for an additional term at the end of the current term. Unless otherwise specified, the automatically renewed plan will be for the same term and will be at the same price and at the same service level as your prior plan. We will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for the renewed plan in the pre-renewal notification. Each automatic renewal and corresponding payment will be processed on the first day of the new term.

YOU MAY ONLY CANCEL YOUR VIDEO PLAN WITHIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS AFTER THE START OF YOUR VIDEO PLAN. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR VIDEO PLAN WITHIN THE FIRST THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE START OF THE VIDEO PLAN, YOU WILL RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. THEREAFTER, NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR CANCELLED VIDEO PLANS. To cancel, please contact Customer Support at our [Help Center](https://support.shutterfly.com/s/).

You may access and use the Video Plan solely for your personal, noncommercial use. Except as expressly authorized hereunder, the Video Plan may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, reverse-engineered or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without our prior written authorization.

Depending on the terms of your promotional offer, you may be enrolled into a Video Plan following the expiration of your promotional period unless you cancel prior to the end of the promotional period.

Shutterfly may, in its sole discretion, and without notice modify the terms and conditions of the Video Plan. We also reserve the right at any time to change the pricing and/or subscription fee as well as plan benefits offered such as storage capacity or features. Changes in the subscription fee for the Video Plans will be applied for renewal periods; however, you will not be charged any new or different fees unless we obtain your prior agreement to pay such additional fees. You agree that it is your sole responsibility to review updated terms and conditions of the Video Plan posted by us at www.shutterfly.com. If any such change is found to be unenforceable, void, invalid, it is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. YOUR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF ANY SUCH CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY SUCH CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR PROGRAM MEMBERSHIP.

Shutterfly reserves the right to terminate, suspend or restrict your membership and Video Plan, with or without notice, for any or no reason whatsoever. Without limiting the foregoing, Shutterfly may terminate your membership in the Video Plan if you violate the Terms or any applicable law, terms and conditions of any services offered by us, or if your use of our services or the Video Plan is determined, in our discretion, to involve fraud or misuse. Failure to enforce any termination rights for any conduct shall not be deemed a waiver of any of our termination rights.

In the event of cancellation, expiration, downgrade or termination of your membership and Video Plan, you may be unable to access your Video Content and you may no longer be allowed to upload additional Video Content. You may also lose access to certain features or functionality only available to current subscribers.

IN THE EVENT OF CANCELLATION, EXPIRATION, DOWNGRADE, OR TERMINATION OF YOUR VIDEO PLAN OR MEMBERSHIP, WE MAY ALSO DELETE SOME OR ALL OF YOUR VIDEO CONTENT. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BACK-UP YOUR VIDEO CONTENT PRIOR TO THE CANCELLATION, EXPIRATION, DOWNGRADE OR TERMINATION.
