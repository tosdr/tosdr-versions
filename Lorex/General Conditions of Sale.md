Your purchase of any Products from Lorex constitutes your agreement to be bound by the T&Cs and any terms incorporated by reference, including, without limitation, the Lorex Terms of Service [here](https://www.lorex.com/policies/terms-of-service), Limited Hardware Warranty [here](https://www.lorex.com/pages/warranty) (the “Lorex Warranty”) (collectively, the “Terms”).

Please carefully review the Terms as they affect your legal rights and responsibilities. Your purchase of a Product requires that you agree to the Terms. If you do not understand the Terms or do not accept any part of them, do not place an Order (as defined in Section 3 below).

**2\. CHANGES TO THE TERMS**
----------------------------

The date the Terms were last revised is identified at the top of the page. The Terms in effect at the time you place an Order for the Product will apply to such order and Product. Lorex reserves the right to make amendments to the Terms from time to time without notifying you, and any such amendments will apply to future Orders.

**3\. ORDERING AND PAYMENT**
----------------------------

The Products advertised, listed or described on the Website are invitations to you to make offers to Lorex, to purchase such Products, and are not offers to sell Products to you. You are deemed to make an offer to Lorex to purchase the Products referenced in your order upon submitting an order to Lorex via the online checkout process or by contacting Lorex’s Customer Service Department by phone (each, an “**Order**”).

All Products offered are subject to availability. Lorex reserves the right to discontinue offering certain Products without prior notice. Further, certain Products have quantity limits. You may not order more than the maximum number of Products that Lorex specifies on a product page or in a product description.

By providing a credit card or other payment method accepted by Lorex, you (a) represent and warrant that (i) you are authorized to use the designated payment method and (ii) the payment information you supply to Lorex is true, correct, and complete, and (b) you authorize Lorex (or its third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your Order (including any applicable taxes and other charges detailed at checkout). If the payment method you provide cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem Lorex encounters in order to proceed with your Order.

Lorex reserves the right to reject all or part of an Order or a return request and may refuse to ship Products to you for reasons such as: (a) if Lorex detects suspicious or fraudulent activity (including unauthorized reseller activity) in violation of the Terms; (b) if you do not live in a Supported Country (as defined in Section 7 below); or (c) if you order more than the permitted maximum number of Products.

Lorex closely monitors all online credit card transactions. If an Order is suspected to be fraudulent, it will be cancelled and refunded automatically. If your credit card was used without your authorization, please contact Lorex immediately and notify your financial institution.

Backorders. If you purchase a Product that is backordered, your Order will be processed at the time that the backordered Product becomes available. You will receive notification of processing and shipment via email at the time that the Order is processed. Backorders for certain Products will be upgraded to the next equivalent model (at no cost to you) provided Lorex has sufficient stock of the equivalent model to fulfill your backorder

**4\. PRICES, TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES**
---------------------------------------

The Product price displayed on the Website does not include any shipping charges. Information about shipping charges will be presented at checkout before you place your Order. All prices displayed on the Website are subject to change at any time without notice.

Applicable taxes will be presented at checkout, and such taxes are estimated and may be subject to change until you are charged. You may find information about sales tax, which may be applicable to you, [here](https://www.lorex.com/pages/about-sales-tax). This information is provided to you for your information only and does not form a part of the Terms and is not binding on Lorex.

Orders shipped from the United States of America (“U.S.”) destined for an international destination may be subject to local import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the country where the goods are being delivered. If import duties and other charges are applicable, such charges are borne by the recipient; Lorex has no control over such charges and cannot predict what the amount of these charges may be.

Lorex offers you price match protection for up to 30 days on purchases made directly on the Website (subject to Section 6 below). Should you find a lower price on the Website within 30 days of your purchase of the same Product, you may make a request to Lorex as provided [here](https://www.lorex.com/pages/contact) within such 30 day period. To qualify for the price match, the Products must have exactly the same model number, components, and should be in the same new or open box condition. Upon receipt of such request, Lorex will verify the information and will price match to the lower sale price and offer you a full refund of the difference.

Please note: Lorex will not be price matching during Special Promotions (as defined and detailed in Section 6 below).

**5\. NO RESALE**
-----------------

You may only purchase the Products for personal or internal use. You may not resell any of the Products.

**6\. PROMOTIONS**
------------------

Lorex may offer coupon codes or other promotions for the sale of certain Products. If so, any terms applicable to such promotional offers will govern the applicable offer. Lorex reserves the right to cancel any promotions without notice.

Lorex coupons do not have any cash value and can only be redeemed on the Website. You can redeem only one coupon per Order. You cannot combine the value of several coupons for use with one Order. Lorex does not honor expired coupons and Lorex will not price match expired offers. If you return a Product that was purchased with a coupon, you will be refunded only for the amount you paid (the price of the Product, less the coupon value). The coupon value will not be refunded when/if the applicable Product is returned.

"Black Friday" and "Cyber Monday" promotional codes/coupons (**“Special Promotions”**) can only be used for new Orders, and cannot be applied to Orders placed prior to Lorex’s "Black Friday" and "Cyber Monday" promotion week. Price adjustments for online Orders cannot be made during the "Black Friday" and "Cyber Monday" promotional period.

Some Orders placed during Lorex’s Special Promotions may need to be cancelled due to stock limitations. If your Order is affected Lorex will notify you by email, and a refund will be processed as soon as possible.

**7\. DELIVERY**
----------------

Lorex currently only delivers Products to addresses in Canada, the U.S. and the United Kingdom (**“UK”**) (each, a **“Supported Country”**). Lorex does not deliver to (a) PO Boxes or APO addresses or any of the U.S. territories including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. If you provide a shipping address that is not in a Supported Country, your Order will be cancelled, you will be sent a notice, and you will not be charged for your order.

If there is no issue with your Order, Lorex will ship it as soon as reasonably possible and in any event within 30 days after the day on which Lorex confirms your Order. Title to Products purchased by you and the related risk of loss on these items pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. Lorex may contact you and request certain information from you so that it can provide the Products to you (e.g., billing verification or shipping address verification). If you do not provide the requested information within a reasonable time upon Lorex’s request, or if you provide incomplete or incorrect information, Lorex may cancel the Order and issue a full refund. Lorex will not be responsible for supplying the Products late or not supplying the Products or any part of them if this is caused by you not providing the requested information within a reasonable time of Lorex’s request.

If a Product cannot be successfully delivered to you, the Product will be returned to Lorex. In that case and once Lorex receives the return shipment, you will not be charged for the Product (or charges already incurred will be reversed using the initial payment method you provided), but you may be charged for shipping (and such charges may not be reversed). If a Product is not successfully delivered because Lorex or its delivery agent made a mistake, you will not be charged and all charges already paid by you will be reversed.

If you have a package that has been shipped (based on shipping notice sent by Lorex to you by email) and it has not arrived with ten (10) days, please [contact Lorex](https://www.lorex.com/pages/contact) for the tracking information.

Any delivery dates or times provided by Lorex (or its delivery agent) are estimates only and are not guaranteed.

**8\. SUPPORT**
---------------

Please refer to Lorex’s **Support** page to learn more about any support offered by Lorex in connection with your Products.

**9\. ORDER CANCELLATION**
--------------------------

If you wish to cancel an Order you may do so by [contacting Lorex](https://www.lorex.com/pages/contact). If you have an account with Lorex, you may also login to your Lorex account and cancel the Order online. Please be sure to include your full name and order number in your cancellation request. **Please note that Lorex cannot cancel Orders that have already been charged and shipped**. All cancellation requests will be confirmed by a return email from Lorex’s customer service department.

**10\. RETURN**
---------------

You may return any Product in its original packaging provided that the Product is not damaged or abused when you are trying and testing it for your use. For purchases made directly from the Website, you may return the Products for any reason within 30 days of delivery (subject to applicable conditions listed in the grid below). You are responsible for all return shipping fees and bear the risk of loss during shipment. Lorex therefore strongly recommends that you fully insure your return shipment against loss or damage and that you use a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery for your protection. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original purchase on the Website once Lorex receives the Product back from you or if the Product was not delivered to you, then once you tell Lorex you have changed your mind. Funds will be returned within 14 days or earlier in accordance with applicable law and policies applicable to the method of payment. **Please note that original shipping fees are not refundable.**

For directions on returning a Product for a refund, or for replacing a Product under warranty, please [click here](https://www.lorex.com/pages/returns). Information linked in the foregoing sentence is provided for your information only, none of such information forms part of this Terms or is binding on Lorex.

Rights provided to you under this section only apply to purchases made directly from the Website; they do not apply to purchases made through other distribution channels, such as brick and mortar retailers, online marketplaces (e.g. Amazon), and other retailers.

**11\. DATA STORED ON YOUR PRODUCTS**
-------------------------------------

You are responsible for managing any data stored on your Products including, for example, deleting, transferring and creating back-ups of such data. For example, if you decide to return a Product, or if you have to send a Product to Lorex for replacement, it is your responsibility to erase all personal information and other data on the Product before sending it to Lorex. Lorex will not be responsible for any use or disclosure of any data that resides on a Product.

If you tell Lorex that you have not received your Product, your Product is defective, or it has been lost or stolen, Lorex may deactivate the applicable Product. Deactivation does not automatically delete personal information or other data stored on your Product. Lorex strongly recommends that you periodically back-up the data stored on your Product.

**12\. WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS**
-----------------------------------

Products purchased directly from Lorex (or its authorized resellers identified here) include a one-year manufacturer warranty from the date of purchase, as further described and conditioned in the Warranty [here](https://www.lorex.com/pages/warranty). The limited warranty provided under the [Warranty](https://www.lorex.com/pages/warranty) is only for the benefit of end users and not resellers of the Products, provided that the end user has purchased the Products from Lorex or one of its authorized resellers (identified [here](https://www.lorex.com/pages/authorized-resellers)).

Nothing in this section or the [Warranty](https://www.lorex.com/pages/warranty) affects your legal rights under statutory or applicable laws. Unless otherwise required under applicable laws, Lorex may only provide warranty support for Products manufactured by Lorex that are located in a Supported Country.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE TERMS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LOREX HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTY AND CONDITION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS. YOU AGREE THAT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER THIS SECTION ARE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THE WARRANTY.

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LOREX PARTIES' TOTAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCTS OR THE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO LOREX FOR THE PRODUCTS WHICH GIVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

Some provinces, states or countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of damages as provided above, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

**14\. THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES**
------------------------------------------

Some of the Products may require the use of Internet connectivity services. You acknowledge that none of the Products come with any Internet connectivity service. Unless specifically provided in any Product description page or otherwise agreed by Lorex in writing, Lorex has no responsibility for the provision of any Internet connectivity services or any other products or services you may require for the use of the applicable Product. You acknowledge that such products and/or services are provided by third party providers (**“Third Party Products”**) and your access to and use of the same are subject to third party providers’ terms and conditions. You are solely responsible for obtaining Third Party Products that are compatible with your Product. Lorex is not responsible and has no control over the provision of or your access to or use of any Third Party Products.

You understand that your Product may only be compatible with certain hardware accessories manufactured by third parties, and Lorex makes no warranty with respect to such third party hardware accessories or their compatibility with your Product.
