Privacy policy
==============

Lorex Website and Product Privacy Policy
========================================

**ENGLISH | [FRENCH](https://www.lorex.com/pages/privacy-policy-fr) | [SPANISH](https://www.lorex.com/pages/privacy-policy-sp)**

  
  

Effective: October 11, 2023

Lorex Technology Inc. and its affiliates, including Lorex Corporation and Lorex Technology UK Limited (“Lorex”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”).

This Privacy Policy demonstrates our commitment to protecting the privacy of your information, as described below. Providing exceptional services involves collecting, using, and sharing Personal Information about individuals. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, maintain, protect, and share your Personal Information.

1.0 SCOPE
---------

This Privacy Policy describes the type of Personal Information you provide to us or that we collect from you when you use our Websites, Products (including all Lorex devices), Lorex Cloud Storage Plans, Customer and Technical Support (“Services”), Apps, and Cloud Services.

This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide to us when you:

* Use our websites, including, without limitation, [https://www.lorex.ca](https://www.lorex.ca/), [https://www.lorex.com](https://www.lorextechnology.com/), and [https://www.lorextechnology.co.uk/](https://www.lorextechnology.co.uk/) including any mobile versions of the websites and social media sites (the "Websites");
* Access your Lorex account, or use our software, products (hardware and all Lorex devices), or services such as customer support (the "Products" and "Services"), which includes the use of our mobile applications (the "Apps"). Please note that some of our services are cloud-based and certain data we collect are stored in the cloud (the "Cloud Services").

In this Privacy Policy, the Websites, Products, Services, Apps, and Cloud Services are collectively referred to as "Lorex Solutions.”

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and check it from time to time to inform yourself of any changes. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to [Contact Us](https://www.lorex.com/pages/contact).

### Other Links:

Our Websites and Apps may contain links to other third-party sites. When you click on one of these links, you are visiting a website operated by someone other than us, and the operator of that website has a different privacy policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third-party operators.

For this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information/Personal Data” means information about an identifiable individual (e.g. name, email address) or information that can be used to identify an individual or as further defined in applicable laws. For individuals in the UK, under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Personal Data does not include “aggregated” or “anonymized” information that cannot be used to personally identify you. For California residents, Personal Information, under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), does not include publicly available information like federal, state, or local government records, information about professional licenses, and public real estate or property records.

2.0 COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
-----------------------------

We limit the Personal Information we collect from you to what is necessary to provide you with Lorex Solutions and maintain a relationship with you. We collect information directly from you when you engage with us such as when you purchase Products from us, create an account, or seek customer support. Depending on the settings you choose on our Products, we may temporarily collect thumbnail photos of motion activities to send you notifications. We may also collect your non-precise location information if you choose to share your device location with us.

We DO NOT have access to your video and audio recordings, live video and audio streams, images, comments, and data our Products collect from their surrounding environment (motion detection and special events such as door open/close), collectively referred to as “Video Data”. Video Data is stored locally on your device unless you have subscribed to a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan. When you subscribe to a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, we collect Video Data to provide you with the Services you have signed up for, but do not have direct access to it.

Like most websites and apps, we collect usage data which shows us how many individuals visit our Websites and, in general, how users interact with our Apps. Most of this information is anonymized and aggregated. We may also collect your Personal Information from third parties such as payment processors or third party apps, which integrate into our Products.

For the General Data Protection Regulation and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (both referred to here as “GDPR”), Lorex Technology UK Limited is the “controller” of the Personal Data you provide to us. As a Controller, we are trusted to look after and deal with your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We determine the ways and means of processing and must therefore be accountable for it.

### Information You Provide to Us

You provide information to us in various ways, including the following:

* **Account Details**. When you create an account, you provide us with profile information such as your username, password, country/region, and your contact details, such as your email address and phone number. You also provide us with information about your preferences, such as when you wish to receive notifications. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Performance of a Contract”\]  
      
    
* **Purchase Information**. When you purchase from us, we typically collect your billing and shipping address, email, and telephone number, as well as the item purchased. We also collect your payment method and the last 4 digits of your credit card. We use a reputable third-party service provider to securely process your credit card-related information in accordance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Performance of a Contract”\]  
      
    
* **Technical Information**. In the course of customer support services and Product purchases, we may collect from you technical information about your Lorex Products and Services, such as the product model and serial number, software version, device ID, and device name. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Legitimate Interest”\]  
      
    
* **Motion and Location Information.** We collect motion activities captured on a recording within the boundaries of your video to send you notifications about an event (i.e. motion detection). We may also collect non-precise location information if you choose to share your mobile device location with us to receive notifications when you are outside of your set boundaries (i.e. Home and Away feature). \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Legitimate Interest”\]  
      
    
* **Other Information**. We collect information when you communicate directly with us:  
      
    * by contacting Technical Support / Customer Service, in which case we may collect your name, email address, and phone number to verify you and be able to associate you with a service ticket issued for you. Your call may be recorded, and your online chat may be transcribed. Additionally, we use an artificial intelligence system to analyze the calls, to determine the level of customer satisfaction with our Services and train customer support agents. We may use this information for quality assurance, training, and statistical purposes so that we can maintain a high level of service quality. When you engage with our online chat feature, we may send you emails with promotions or information we think you will find relevant. We will treat all Personal Information provided during the calls or online chats in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is designed to protect your privacy and maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information. If you have any questions about our use or storage of your Personal Information, please contact us for more information on your options regarding the collection and use of your Personal Information during calls or online chats. You also have the right to opt out of receiving emails from us. To exercise this right, please see Your Choices and Rights \[Our lawful basis for processing information for technical support is “Contract”; our lawful basis for processing information for quality assurance, training and statistical purposes is “Legitimate Interest”\]; and
    * via social media such as through our Twitter or Facebook page, respond to surveys, participate in contests or promotions, provide product reviews and feedback, engage in a web chat, or subscribe to our newsletters. We may also collect your contact information such as your name, email address, demographic information, social media profile information, and other information you choose to share with us. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Legitimate Interest”\]

### Information We Automatically Collect or Generate

* **_How You Use Lorex Solutions:_** We collect information about how you use our Products and Services, who you share access with, what devices are connected, and event data. We also collect the following:  
      
    

* **Thumbnail photo images**. We offer you the choice of using thumbnail photos and notifications. Should you choose to use them, we will collect thumbnail photos of events so that you may access those images or we can send you push notifications of events. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Consent”\]  
      
    
* **Videos, audio, images**. Our Products and Services allow you to stream, view, or record video (and in some cases audio) data from your local device (Video Data). We automatically collect system logs, such as when a door was opened or closed.  
      
    If you have a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, you can store, view, and stream video and audio data from the Lorex’s cloud servers. Video Data transmitted to our cloud servers is encrypted and compressed before transmission. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Performance of a Contract”\]
  
* **We do NOT have access to Video Data when you store it locally**. If you do not have a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, your Video Data is encrypted, stored locally in your device, and inaccessible to us. Neither we nor our service providers have direct access to your Video Data unless you disclose it to us with your explicit consent. We only use this access for the limited purpose of providing support services to you in connection with Lorex Solutions, or for such other purposes as you may authorize or designate, such as integration into Smart Home services, in which case your Video Data may be shared with the Smart Home service(s) of your choosing. References to “cloud-enabled” Lorex solutions refer to the transmission of Video Data from your recording device to your other devices. Neither Lorex nor any of its service providers, including our parent company, have access to those transmissions.  
      
    
* **We do NOT access Video Data stored in your Lorex Cloud Storage Plan**. If you have a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, although your videos are stored on Lorex’s cloud servers, neither we nor our service providers have direct access to your Video Data unless you disclose it to us with your explicit consent. We only use this access for the limited purpose of providing support services to you in connection with Lorex Solutions, or for such other purposes as you may authorize or designate.
  
* **Device and Connection Information**: In order to provide our Services and allow Products to function as expected, we automatically collect the Device ID, Device Username, Device Name, IP Address, and Device Type from the Products you use. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Legitimate Interest”\]
  
* **IP Address for Multi-Camera Lorex Cloud Storage Plans**: As Lorex Multi-Camera Cloud Storage Plans are limited to a single location for use, your IP Address is used to validate that your devices are used in accordance with your subscription terms. \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Legitimate Interest”\]
  
* **Website and App Usage Information**: Like most websites, when you visit our Websites, we may receive information about your visit, use or interaction with our Websites. Although most of the information we collect is anonymized and aggregated usage data, such as how many individuals visited our Websites, peak hours of visits, the general location of your device, and which page(s) were viewed, we may also collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We collect this information through the use of cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies. To learn more about how we collect this information and how you may control what information we collect please refer to our [Cookie Notice](https://www.lorex.com/pages/cookie-notice). \[Our lawful basis for processing this data is “Consent”\]
  

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Privacy, audio recording, and video surveillance laws in your jurisdiction may apply to your use of our Products and Services. You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with applicable laws when you use our Products and Services. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or place of business that you are using our Products or Services. Capturing, recording, or sharing video or audio content that involves other people, or capturing or retaining visitors’ facial feature information or audio, may affect their privacy rights.

### Information We Collect From Third Parties

We also collect information from third parties such as our payment processors. We collect reviews you submit on third-party platforms about our Products or Services. When you leave a review on the Lorex website, the review is made public and may be placed on other retailers’ websites that offer Lorex’s Products or Services.

We collect information about your purchases, demographic information and your social media profile information. We may also collect information about how you use other apps when you willingly connect our Products with third-party apps and products, such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa.

3.0 USE OF INFORMATION
----------------------

We primarily use your Personal Information to provide you with Lorex Solutions, manage, maintain, and improve our Products and Services, and communicate with you. We may also use your Personal Information to send you relevant marketing and promotional messages. You may opt out of receiving these messages at any time. If we intend to use your information for any other purpose, we will provide you with notice at that time and seek your consent when required to do so. We do not make use of your Video Data, whether you are on a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan or not, for any purposes other than those stated in the Privacy Policy, or that you explicitly authorize.

We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us to:

* **Provide you with our Services** such as customer service and support, process and fulfill shipments, and provide the technical backend to the function of our Services and Products.

4.0 SHARE OF INFORMATION  

---------------------------

We share Personal Information with service providers who perform services on our behalf. We only share the information they need to be able to provide us with their services. We also require them, through contractual obligations, to have appropriate measures to protect Personal Information and limit their use of the information. We may also share your Personal Information if you requested that we do so, such as with your family or friends or with an integrated app. We will not disclose your information for any reason other than what is outlined in this Privacy Policy or as permitted by applicable law. We do not sell your Personal Information.

We share Personal Information with the following parties:

* **Parent and affiliates** to deliver you the Products and Services you order or use. We do that so we have a single, holistic view of our customers, and provide you with the best and most seamless possible experience. Lorex has implemented contractual, technical, and organizational safeguards to restrict the transfer of information. We only grant access to the personal information that is necessary for us to provide you with our service. Similar to Lorex, our parent company and affiliates do not have access to your video recordings. Please also see International Data Transfers.  
      
    
* **Contractors, service providers, and other third parties** we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential, and secure, and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. We may use service providers for services such as delivery logistics and fulfillment, e-commerce (Shopify), cloud service providers, advertising and marketing, analytics, customer support, payment processing, financing and extended warranty, and fraud detection.  
      
    To offer you access to financing and extended warranty services, we may share your Personal Information with independent third parties during the checkout process to evaluate whether you qualify for access to their services. The third parties we use include Klarna, PayBright, and Extend. These service providers process your Personal Information in accordance with their privacy policies.  
      
    As part of our anti-fraud monitoring and prevention efforts, Lorex uses and discloses Personal Information such as your name, address, contact details, transaction data, connection data and behavioural data to our main anti-fraud service provider, Forter ([https://www.forter.com/services-privacy-policy/](https://www.forter.com/services-privacy-policy/) ). Lorex uses such Personal Information to make automated decisions to help decide whether your account is being used for fraudulent purposes. Forter may combine your Personal Information with existing information they have about you or use it independently, to prevent online transaction fraud with their other customers. The use of such databases may lead other merchants or financial institutions to make decisions as to whether or not to authorize your transaction or grant you access to a product or service, to the extent automated decision-making is permitted by law. Please note such service providers and our affiliates may be located outside the jurisdiction of your residence.  
      
    We use an anti-bot service on our Websites to check whether the data entered on our Websites, such as on a login page, has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, the service analyzes the behaviour of our website visitors based on various characteristics. For the analysis, reCaptcha evaluates various information of visitors (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, mouse movements, and keypress events) to determine human confidence, as well as aggregate overall captcha completion.  
    
* **Individuals**, such as family or friends, which you choose for us to share your information with, such as access to Products through an invitation link sent by you through the App.  
      
    
* **Third party products and apps**, such as voice assistance services (e.g. Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant), if you choose to integrate our Products with those services. These services collect audio data (i.e. voice) to help operate and control enabled Products. The data these services collect to help operate our Products are governed by the privacy policies of such services, and you should review and consider such privacy policies before selecting or using these services.  
      
    
* **Buyers or other successors** in the event of a merger, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information we hold is among the assets transferred.  
      
    
* **Government bodies and law enforcement**, to the extent they have a binding order or warrant, which compels Lorex to provide them access to your information, including but not limited to your Video Data. Please note that if you do not have a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, we cannot disclose your Video Data and other data that is strictly stored on your Devices. If, however, you do have a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan and we receive a demand order, we will take measures to redirect the governmental body to request the Video Data from you directly, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. If we are compelled to release this information, we will give you reasonable notice to seek protective orders or other remedies, unless Lorex is legally prohibited from doing so.
  
* **Other parties if we are required to do so by law** and such disclosure is necessary for compliance with our legal obligation, including disclosure to exercise or defend a legal claim, to investigate or prevent a crime, to enforce and apply the terms of use, including billing and collection purposes, and if we believe that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, customers, or others.

If for any reason we are required or permitted by the applicable law to disclose your Personal Information to any other party, we will notify you if we are permitted to do so or we will seek your consent as required by applicable law. We may provide third parties with aggregated and anonymized statistical information and analytics about the use of our Lorex Solutions, in which case, you are not identifiable.

5.0 ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS
-----------------------------

Like many other websites and apps, we use third parties, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how individuals use our Websites and Apps The information collected is aggregated and we cannot identify who you are. We do collect your IP address, which in some jurisdictions is considered Personal Information.

We may also use Google and Facebook to advertise to you. We may do this through the use of cookies and similar technologies. You may opt out of receiving advertisements. See our [Cookies Notice](https://www.lorex.com/pages/cookie-notice).

We partner with third parties, such as Google and Facebook to show you advertisements about our Products and Services on websites and apps that you visit, which we think you would find relevant. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, social media plugins and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services, as well as your use of unaffiliated websites, apps, social media content, and ads to send you Lorex advertisements that are relevant to you. They may also measure the effectiveness of our ads and email marketing as well as use a third party to personalize web and email experiences for our clients.

For more information about interest-based advertising and cross-device linking practices, please visit [the Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/) ("NAI") website, [the Digital Advertising Alliance](https://youradchoices.com/) ("DAA") website, and [the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](https://edaa.eu/) ("EIDAA") websites. You may opt-out or withdraw your consent to cookies or similar technologies either on your browser or on the cookie banner/tool on our Websites and Apps. Please see the [Cookie Notice](https://www.lorex.com/pages/cookie-notice) for more information.

We may also use third-party service providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Websites and Apps. In particular, our Websites and Apps may use Google Analytics to help track, monitor, and report traffic on our Websites and Apps. Google tracks information such as (i) your IP address; (ii) the type of web browser and operating system being used; (iii) how you navigate our Websites and Apps; and (iv) other websites you visited before visiting our Websites. Google compiles this information into aggregated statistical reports that are used by Lorex to optimize our Websites and Apps and enhance user experience. Google may also transfer this information to other third parties where they are required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. You can opt out of having your activity on Websites and Apps made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about a visitor’s activity. For more information on Google’s privacy practices, please visit: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

6.0 HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------

We have implemented physical, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information.

We maintain physical, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect your Personal Information from misuse, unauthorized access by our personnel, disclosure, and loss. We restrict access to Personal Information to those staff members and third parties who need to know the information to provide services necessary for us to fulfill our obligation. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that information transmitted over the internet will always remain secure, which is why we encourage you to take appropriate steps to protect your information, such as creating strong passwords and not sharing your passwords with anyone.

7.0 HOW LONG WE KEEP INFORMATION
--------------------------------

We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose we originally collected it for or as required under applicable law.

Your Personal Information will be kept for at least as long as it is necessary to carry out the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and subject to applicable laws.

Once you close your account, we will retain your information for as long as necessary to meet our legal obligations, after which we discard it. Even if we discard your Personal Information it may persist on electronic backup made in the normal course of business for an additional period of time.

If you have chosen to use the thumbnail feature, thumbnail photo images of events are encrypted and stored on the Lorex Cloud for up to 3 days before being permanently deleted. If you are on a Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, the retention of these thumbnails may be longer, and is outlined in the Lorex Cloud Storage Plan’s description. Should you cancel your Lorex Cloud Storage Plan, your Video Data will be deleted upon final expiry of the subscription.
