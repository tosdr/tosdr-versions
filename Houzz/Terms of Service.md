_This section describes Houzz's dispute resolution procedures. You agree to notify us of any dispute with Houzz and first attempt to resolve it informally under the process outlined below. If that does not work, the dispute will be decided through arbitration, not in court. Residents of the EU may be afforded different rights based on the country that they live in._

* **Binding Arbitration.** You and Houzz agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, our Privacy Policy, or to your use of the Houzz Platform (collectively "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions detailed in this Section 10. **This means that you and Houzz both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury.**
* **Exceptions to Arbitration.** Each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring a claim against Houzz in "small claims" court, instead of by arbitration, but only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis, and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis.
* **Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution.** If you have a Dispute with Houzz, prior to filing any claim in any forum, you agree to first send a detailed notice ("**Notice**") to Houzz by: (i) email at legal@houzz.com **and** (ii) first class, certified mail addressed to Houzz Inc., Legal Department, c/o Corporation Service Company, Inc., 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware 19808. Your Notice must contain all of the following information: (i) your full name; (ii) your address, telephone number, and email address associated with your Houzz account; (iii) information sufficient for Houzz to identify any transaction, product, or service at issue (e.g., order confirmation, Houzz Pro subscription, etc); and (iv) a detailed description of your Dispute, the nature and basis of your claim(s), and the nature and basis of the relief you are seeking with a calculation for it, and (v) your personal signature. If Houzz has a Dispute with you, Houzz agrees to first send a detailed Notice to your email address listed in your profile or via any other contact information you have made available to us. Houzz's Notice will likewise set forth: (i) information sufficient for you to identify any transaction at issue; and (ii) a detailed description of our dispute, the nature, and basis of our claims and any relief we are seeking. Your Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person's dispute.  
    You and Houzz agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute in an effort to swiftly resolve it without the need for a formal proceeding. If requested by Houzz, you and Houzz agree to personally meet and confer, via videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve any claim covered by this Agreement. For sake of clarification only, this conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. This process should result in resolution of the Dispute, but, if for some reason it is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the parties have not agreed to extend this time period, you or Houzz may initiate an arbitration. **You and Houzz agree that compliance with and completion of this mandatory informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration.** The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration administrator shall not move forward with the administration of any Demand upon written notice from Houzz that the other demanding party has not complied with the informal process. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a fully completed Notice and participating in good faith in this informal dispute resolution process.  
    If we are not able to resolve the Dispute informally, then the below provisions will govern any Dispute. If you live outside of the United States and do not use the Houzz Platform as a professional or business, some mandatory provisions of your local consumer protection law, if any exist, may also apply to the Dispute.
* **Class Action Waiver.** You and Houzz agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. **This means that, in connection with any Dispute, you and Houzz both agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action proceeding. Further, unless you and Houzz agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class action proceeding.**
* **Arbitration Administration and Rules.** The arbitration will be administered by ADR Services Inc. ("ADR Services") and shall be subject to ADR Services' most current version of its Arbitration Rules, available at [https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules](https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules) or by calling ADR Services, Inc. at (310) 201-0010. If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum, and either party may invoke 9 U.S.C. § 5 to request that a court appoint an arbitration provider. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider shall administer the arbitration, only a court (and not an arbitrator or arbitration administrator) may resolve that dispute, and the arbitration shall be stayed pending the court's ruling.
* **Arbitration Process.** A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified by ADR Services' Rules available at [https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules](https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules). The Demand must describe the nature and basis for the claim and includes all of the information required in the Notice. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from ADR Services' roster of arbitrators with relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 7 business days of delivery of the Demand, then ADR Services will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with ADR Services' Rules.
* **Arbitration Location and Procedure. Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing by default, unless you and Houzz agree upon another location in writing.** If the arbitration is in person, the seat of the arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California, unless you and Houzz agree otherwise or ADR Services' Rules provide otherwise. If your claim does not exceed USD $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Houzz submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds USD $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by ADR Services' Rules. Subject to ADR Services' Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
* **Arbitrator's Decision and Governing Law.** The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in ADR Services' Rules. Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the "Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability" section set forth in this Terms of Use. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
* **Fees.** Each party's responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees are set forth in ADR Services' Rules. Houzz will consider reimbursing the opposing party's portion of ADR Services' fees upon a showing of financial hardship, but only if the opposing party is an individual consumer, and not a professional or business. Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys' fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim, or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and ADR Services' Rules.
* **Special Procedures for Mass Arbitrations.** If, at any time, 30 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Houzz by the same or coordinated counsel or entities ("**Mass Filing**"), ADR Services will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the Mass Filings. Claims numbered 1-10 will be the "Initial Test Cases" and will proceed to arbitration first. The arbitrators will render a final award for the Initial Test Cases within 120 days of the initial pre-hearing conference, unless the claims are resolved in advance, the parties agree to extend the deadline, or the arbitrator extends the deadline. The parties will then have 90 days (the "**Mediation Period**") (which may be extended by the parties) to resolve the remaining cases in mediation based on the awards from the Initial Test Cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding claims during this time, the parties may choose to opt out of the arbitration process and proceed in court by providing written notice to the other party within 60 days after the Mediation Period. Otherwise, the remaining cases will be arbitrated in their assigned order. Any statute of limitations will be tolled from the time the Initial Test Cases are chosen until your case is chosen as described above.
* **Opt-Out.** You have the right to opt out of the arbitration provisions of Section 10 by sending a written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Houzz Inc., Houzz Legal Department, c/o Corporation Service Company, Inc., 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware 19808. The notice must be postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first agreed to the Terms; and (ii) the date that you first became subject to any version of an arbitration provision in the Terms. You must include all of the following in the written notice: (1) your name and mailing address; (2) the email address associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreement's arbitration agreement.

**Governing Law & Jurisdiction:** This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to their conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a federal or state court located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the arbitration provision, as set forth in Section 10, does not apply.

**Disputes with Other Users** : If you have a dispute with another user on the Houzz Platform or with any third party, you agree that Houzz is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Houzz, our directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Houzz Platform. **As part of this release, you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit this release to only include those claims that you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.**
