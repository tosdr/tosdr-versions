**Account and Profile Information.** When you create an account on our Platform, we collect information you provide us, like your name, email address, interests, gender, age, and profile information. If you are a professional, you may also provide us information related to your business, including a business name, description, phone number, and areas served. If you use financial tools or services offered through our Platform, for example, to request or accept payments for your business services, we collect information to facilitate those transactions, such as copies of identification cards, proof of business ownership, bank name, account numbers, tax numbers and other business documentation as needed to verify your identity or integrate with our service providers.

**Content You Submit.** We collect information and content that you submit, share, or create across our Platform and on other websites that link to this Privacy Policy. This includes information and content submitted, shared, or created, including but not limited to your company information, profile picture, reviews, messages, comments, searches, photos, style preferences, ideabooks, discussion, project details, project costs, project timelines, change orders, and invoices.

**Purchases.** If you purchase or sell products or services or make or receive payments within our Platform, we collect certain information in order to complete your purchases, sales, and payments, such as your phone number, address, and payment method (for example, credit card or bank account information). If you participate in our Trade Program or Business Program, you may be asked to provide proof that you are eligible for the program or for a tax exemption.

**Communications.** When you communicate with us (via email, phone, through our Platform, through our chatbots, or otherwise) and when you use our Platform to communicate with others, we may record, monitor, collect, and use details about you and your communications (including call time and call duration). Certain professionals on our Platform may choose to use our call tracking feature in order to better manage their business. You are using our Platform when you make calls to these professionals using their phone number displayed on our Platform. We will provide you notice or obtain your consent in accordance with applicable law before recording or monitoring any of these calls. Otherwise, to the extent you communicate with professionals, sellers, and other users outside our Platform, those communications are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

### **Information from Others**

We collect information that others make available to us, including information from other platforms, publicly available information, information from other users of our Platform, information from our partners, service providers, and corporate affiliates, and information from third-party sites.

**Other Platforms.** We may receive information about you from third-party platforms when you allow the third-party platform to share this information with us or allow Houzz to obtain this information from the third party.

**Our Partners and Service Providers.** We may receive information about you from our partners and service providers. For example, our payment processors may update your payment information, advertising partners may help us send communications to your address, and third parties may help us prevent fraud by verifying your contact information. In addition, our financial partners that conduct "know your customer" or "know your business" (KYC or KYB) verification and our banking partners that issue the Houzz credit card(s) may provide us with information they collect directly from you.

**3\. Sharing Your Information**
--------------------------------

We share your personal information in the following ways:

### **Platform Visitors and Users**

One of the main purposes of having a Houzz account is to share home renovation and design ideas with others. Through Houzz, others have the ability to find, contact, view, and follow your profile and public activity on Houzz (for example, if you "like'' content on our Platform or if you create an ideabook and do not mark it private) and link it to your username. You can customize your Houzz profile and whether users may follow you through your Houzz [settings](https://www.houzz.com/settingsAdvanced). Your Houzz content (for example, ideabooks, photos, notes on others' photos, projects, discussions, and social media profiles), followers, and others you follow are publicly viewable on the Platform and open to comments by other Houzz users. If you would like to make certain of your content private, please click [here](https://help.houzz.com/s/article/How-do-I-adjust-my-privacy-settings?language=en_US) for more information. If you are a professional, or merchant on Houzz, we may also display the following information in order to help visitors and users evaluate you: aggregated information on our Platform about your Platform activity (e.g. response rate), and information that is publicly available from third parties.

### **Professionals, Merchants, and Other Businesses on our Platform**

If you request us to find professionals for you, your project information (including the contact information) that you provide will be made available to a limited number of professionals that we believe may be suitable for your project. Such professionals are independent from Houzz and their use of your data is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Professionals and merchants that participate on the Houzz Platform may view your public activities on our Platform and receive feedback you provide to us about your engagement with them. For example, if you requested us to find professionals for you and provide us feedback about your level of interest in these professionals, we may convey such feedback to them. In addition, a professional or merchant can view your public activities on our Platform that are interactions with their content (for example, that you added one of their photos to your non-private ideabook on a particular date, as identified by the username for your profile and any photo or public identifiers you provide for your profile). When you receive messages from professionals through the Platform, Houzz and the professionals can track your interaction with these messages and phone calls, including whether you opened the messages or answered the phone call, or documents shared with these messages. A professional or merchant cannot see your non-public account information or see private activity (for example, if your ideabook is private).

### **Service Providers and Partners**

We may share your information with service providers to help us operate our Platform and provide services to you. For example, we ask third parties to help us perform the following types of services: payment processing; telecommunications; product sales and support; logistics, delivery, and order fulfillment; marketing and advertising; IT services; fraud detection; customer management; and analytics providers to help us understand user behavior on our Platform. We also use service providers and partners to perform services explained in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.houzz.com/cookiePolicy). You can find more information [here](https://help.houzz.com/s/article/Service-Providers-and-Platform-Partners?language=en_US) about our service providers and partners with which we may share your information. Only if you specifically agree to share your contact information with a third-party partner, for example, as part of a contest or promotion we sponsor with such a third party, will we share your contact information with that third-party partner for their direct marketing purposes.

In addition, we may share information about you with third-party platforms when you allow the third-party platform to receive this information from us or allow Houzz to share this information with the third party. Our Platform may include third-party social media features and other third-party plug-ins and widgets. When these features are displayed on our Platform, they are operated or hosted by third parties. We are not responsible for these third parties and third-party platforms, so please carefully review their privacy policies and your permissions granted to these third parties and platforms. For example, you may sign-up for our Platform through Google or Apple.

### **Advertisers and Ad Networks**

We use advertising networks and partners to serve advertisements for us and other businesses, including interest-based advertising, on third-party sites and to assist us in evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising. We may also work with advertising networks and partners to serve ads on our Platform and to communicate with you at the addresses they have for you. We may provide advertising networks, advertising partners, and businesses advertising on our Platform with aggregate information but other than hashed information or device identifiers, we do not disclose your name, contact information, or other personal information. For example, we may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to advertising networks (e.g., Facebook and Google) to serve advertisements to you or others. Depending on where you live, you may have the right to opt out of the sharing of your information for this purpose, to learn how to opt out please see the Your Choices and Rights section of this Privacy Policy.

### **Corporate Affiliates and Business Transfers**

We may share information from or about you with: (a) other companies in the Houzz Group, or (b) a potential or actual acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including bankruptcy or similar proceedings) to another company. We may share your personal information with that company and its advisors before and after the transaction date. In the event of a sale or transfer of our business results, we will notify you in the same way we notify you of a material change to this Privacy Policy.

### **Legal Obligations**

We may disclose information from or about you, as required or permitted by applicable law, if we believe that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us, a service provider, or a partner (which may include disclosure to law enforcement, courts, or governmental authorities); (b) prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with our Platform; (c) protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our visitors, users, corporate affiliates, or the public; or (d) enforce compliance with our agreements with you (for example, the Houzz [Terms of Use](https://www.houzz.com/termsOfUse)).

**Complaints**. If you would like to raise a concern about our use of your information, please contact us first as described in the Contact Us section. We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection or privacy rights in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. Please note, we may also ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond to your request securely and efficiently.

**6\. Data Security and Retention**
-----------------------------------

We use reasonable measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information.

We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we are processing your personal information unless the law permits or requires us to retain your personal information for a longer period. For example, we may need to keep your personal information to provide services on our Platform or to defend future legal claims. We also will retain de-identified information after your account has been deleted. Information you have shared with others will remain visible after your account has been deactivated, deleted or after the information has been removed from your own profile or account. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified, or deleted may continue to reside in our systems for a period of time, and we may maintain copies of this information as part of our business records.

**7\. Children**
----------------

Our Platform is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information. If you become aware or believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section.

**8\. Updates to this Privacy Policy**
--------------------------------------

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of our Privacy Policy will govern our use of information about you. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our Platform or by other means, to offer you an opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. By continuing to access or use our Platform after those changes become effective, you are subject to the revised Privacy Policy.

**10\. International Transfers of Personal Information**
--------------------------------------------------------

We may transfer your personal information to our affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers who are located around the world. When we transfer your information to countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection rules to the laws of your country, we take measures to comply with the applicable data protection laws related to our transfer. If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United Kingdom ("UK") or Switzerland, where applicable law requires a transfer mechanism, we ensure that one or more of the following legal frameworks is in place: (a) we comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to receive personal data transfers from the European Union/European Economic Area to the U.S. (see "Data Privacy Framework Notice"), (b) the recipient is based in a jurisdiction that the European Commission has decided maintains an adequate level of protection for personal data, or (c) the recipient has enacted appropriate safeguards under Article 46 of the GDPR (for example Binding Corporate Rules or Standard Contractual Clauses).

### **Data Privacy Framework Notice**

Houzz Inc. and our U.S. affiliates comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (collectively, the "DPF") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. We have self-certified our commitment to comply with the DPF Principles with respect to personal information we transfer to the United States from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland. If there is ever any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles will govern. Our commitments under the DPF Principles are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the DPF program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

### **Access, Choice, and Onward Transfers**

We describe the types of personal information we receive in the U.S., as well as the purposes for which we collect and use it, in the Collection of Information and Use of Information Sections of this Privacy Policy. If you are located in the EU, UK or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the personal information that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend or delete your personal information if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles. We will give you an opportunity to opt out where personal information we collect will be used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy.

We comply with the DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. You can read more about how we share your personal information and the purposes for which we do so, in the Sharing Your Information Section of this Privacy Policy. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If you would like to exercise any of your rights, or otherwise wish to limit the use or disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the DPF Principles, please contact us via the contact details set out below.

### **Accountability and Redress**

If you have a question or complaint you believe to be within the scope of our DPF certification, please contact us first at privacy@houzz.com to resolve your concern. We will respond and attempt to resolve your concern within 45 days.

In the event we are unable to resolve your concerns, you can contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (JAMS) at no cost to you, by visiting this [link](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework). Under certain conditions, more fully described in [Annex I](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2) on the DPF website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when certain dispute resolution options do not satisfactorily resolve your concerns.

This section provides notice and specific information to consumers in California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut, including information required by the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively "CCPA"), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Consumer Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and Utah Consumer Privacy Act. To view additional US state specific information click [here](https://help.houzz.com/s/topic/0TO0y000000kD9cGAE/account-privacy-help?language=en_US).

We share information with third-party partners to display personalized ads and content on other platforms, for which you have the right to opt-out. You may opt-out of sharing your personal information for these purposes by visiting "Your Privacy Choices" located in the footer of this website, or by adjusting your account settings [here](https://www.houzz.com/privacy-settings). Additionally, you may use an Opt-out Preference Signal or Universal Opt-out Mechanism to notify us of your privacy preference. We will recognize your opt-out preference, as opting-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information with third parties as defined by applicable law. We will apply your opt-out preference only to the browser or device used to signal your preference. When you login to our Platform, we will apply your opt-out preference to your account.

As provided in our Terms of Use, use of the Houzz Platform by anyone under 18 years of age is strictly prohibited. Consequently, we do not knowingly disclose information regarding individuals under 18 years of age to third parties in exchange for consideration. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those set forth in the CCPA. In addition to the rights described above and in the Your Choices and Rights section, California residents may also, subject to certain exceptions, request us to provide information about how we have used and shared your personal information in the previous 12 months. Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut also have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information. Residents of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have the right to confirm whether Houzz is processing their personal information. Please submit these requests for information, as well as requests to access, correct, or delete your information, through this [online support form](https://help.houzz.com/s/contactsupport?language=en_US), through your [privacy settings](https://www.houzz.com/privacy-settings), or by emailing us at privacy@houzz.com. Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut may appeal Houzz's decision regarding their request by contacting us at privacy@houzz.com. If we deny your request, we will notify you and provide our reasons for the denial and instructions regarding the rights you may have under applicable laws to appeal the decision. If the appeal is denied, we will notify you of your rights under applicable laws to contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint. Consistent with applicable privacy laws, except to the extent reasonably related to the value of your personal information, we will not treat you differently for exercising your rights under these laws.

Your authorized agent may exercise your data protection rights on your behalf [via this online support form](https://help.houzz.com/s/contactsupport?language=en_US) or by emailing us at privacy@houzz.com. We may still require you to directly verify your identity and confirm that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer's behalf, we may deny the request. Whether you submit your request directly or through an authorized agent, generally, the only means Houzz has to verify your identity is for you to respond to a specific Houzz email from the Houzz support team from the email address associated with your Houzz account or to click a confirmation or similar button in a specific Houzz email from the email address associated with your Houzz account.
