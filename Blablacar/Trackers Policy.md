[Terms & Conditions](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/about-us/terms-and-conditions) | [Privacy Policy](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/about-us/privacy-policy) | Cookie policy

Comuto SA (“BlaBlaCar”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and mobile applications (individually referred to as “platform” or jointly as “platforms”). In this policy (the “Cookie Policy”), we provide you with more information relating to these technologies and about the choices you can make.

1\. What is a “cookie” and what are “similar tracking technologies”?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A “cookie” is a small text file that is stored and/or read by your web browser on the hard disk of the device you are using (e.g., desktop computer, laptop or smartphone) by websites you visit. In addition to cookies, BlaBlaCar also uses similar technologies for tracking including “pixel”, “tracking scripts” or “software development kits” (known as SDKs). They are small transparent image files or lines of code contained in our website, emails and mobile apps, which record how you interact with them. All these tracking technologies are referred to as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.

2\. Who places cookies on our platforms?
----------------------------------------

Cookies on our platforms are placed either by us (“so-called “first-party cookies”) or by our partners (so called “third-party cookies”).

The list of our partners and the respective privacy policies for these third-party cookies are displayed in the cookie settings, which is displayed to you in the banner when you first visit our platforms, in the footer of our website, and in your member account settings.

3\. What are the different types of cookies and how are they used on our platforms?

* **Essential cookies:**

These cookies allow you to easily navigate our platforms and use basic features like logging in or booking a ride. They are also used to prevent potential security risks. These cookies are essential for BlaBlaCar to work and cannot be turned off.

These cookies help us learn which pages are most and least popular, and what content is most useful to our users. They help us improve our platforms’ performance by making sure users can easily find what they are looking for, for example. These cookies may be set by us or our analytics partners. If you don’t accept these cookies, neither us nor our partners will know when you visited BlaBlaCar.

* **Marketing and targeting cookies:**

These cookies tell us when you visit our platform, which pages you looked at and the links you clicked on. They are used to show you ads that are more relevant to your interests, and help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These cookies may be set by us or our advertising partners. If you don’t accept these cookies, the ads you see will be less relevant to you.

4\. How can you decide about what cookies are used?
