Such termination will not affect either party’s rights or obligations, which accrued before the termination. The provisions of these Terms apply for the benefit of Navient and its officers, directors, employees, and agents. Each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those provisions directly against you on its own behalf.
    
13. **Additional Terms for California Residents**  
    Under Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, California users are entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs, in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210 or by email at [dca@dca.ca.gov](mailto:dca@dca.ca.gov).
    
14. **Alternative Dispute Resolution**
    
    **Arbitration**. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between us arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you or we (1) may elect to assert claims in, or transfer claims to, small claims court if your or our claims qualify, and (2) bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including with respect to temporary restraining orders. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall apply to this arbitration agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages). At least 30 days before beginning an arbitration proceeding, you must send an individualized letter personally signed by you, and identifying yourself by name and address, detailing your legal claims, the requested relief and requesting arbitration to Chief Legal Officer, 13865 Sunrise Valley Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20171 by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS or USPS express mail (signature required). We will do the same; except in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail to the last known address. Within 30 days of such notice, either party may respond to the letter with a request for an informal dispute resolution conference between the parties by video, with counsel present if the party is represented, and the parties agree to so conduct such conference personally and individually in good faith before initiating arbitration. All applicable claims or filing limitations period shall be tolled during the pendency of this pre-arbitration notice period. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its applicable rules unless otherwise stated herein. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. You and we also agree to delegate the issue of arbitrability to a court of competent jurisdiction, rather than to the arbitrator. If you are a prevailing party, you may seek reimbursement of your fees and costs. However, we may seek our attorney’s fees and costs if the arbitrator finds your claims to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or otherwise not satisfying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. There will be only one arbitrator, not a panel, unless the parties agree otherwise. You and we also agree that, if more than one dispute arises against a party regarding the same or substantially similar issues filed by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period, our respective claim(s) will be arbitrated in a coordinated fashion such that JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands together; (2) appoint one arbitrator for the coordinated demands (unless the parties agree otherwise); and (3) issue one set of filing and administrative fees due per side, one procedural calendar, and one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the provisions of this paragraph, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of this paragraph and process. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by us. This arbitration agreement will survive termination of the agreement.
    
    **Enforceability.** If this arbitration agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, by either a court or by JAMS (or another chose arbitral forum), then the entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void and either party may elect to proceed with the dispute in court. The parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction in Section 15 (“Miscellaneous”) shall govern the claim.
    
    **Jury Trial and Small Claims Court.** If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including with respect to temporary restraining orders.
    
    **Class Action Waiver.** Regardless of arbitrability, we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings or lawsuits, whether in arbitration or in a court of law, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, or representative action. Therefore, you waive all rights to bring claims on behalf of a class of persons; however, you may still bring an individual claim for public injunctive relief and in small claims court. Nothing in this provision, however, should operate to prevent the parties from settling claims on a class-wide basis or otherwise coordinating claims filed in arbitration.
    
15. **Miscellaneous**  
    You represent and warrant that you possess the legal right and ability to enter into these Terms and to use the Site in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you shall comply with all laws and regulations that apply to your access and use of the Site, including any applicable national laws that prohibit the export or transmission of technical data or software to certain territories or jurisdictions. Navient reserves the right to seek all remedies available at law and in equity for violations of these Terms, including the right to remove your account and any contents generated by you on the Site, to block your access to the Site, or to block IP addresses. These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to its provisions relating to conflict of laws. You and Navient agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located within Fairfax County, Virginia to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with these Terms and the Site (and any non-contractual disputes and/or claims relating to or arising in connection with it) and that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 14 (“Alternative Dispute Resolution”) above. The failure of Navient to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute, regulation, or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
