of the current Subscription Services. Yoga Buddhi makes no guarantee that it will continue

throughout the term of your subscription. It is possible that certain items from the Subscription

Services will become free features, or that they will be removed from the App entirely. We may

also add new items to the Subscription Services throughout your subscription term. Please note

that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Subscription

Service are deemed part of this Agreement. In our continued assessment of the Subscription

Services, we may from time to time, with respect to any or all of our users, experiment with or

otherwise offer certain features or other elements of the Services, including promotional

features, user interfaces, plans, pricing, and advertisements. You acknowledge that Yoga

Buddhi Co. may do so in Yoga Buddhi Co.’s sole discretion at any time without notice. You also

agree that Yoga Buddhi Co. will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or

discontinuance of the Services, although if you subscribe to the Subscription Services and Yoga

Buddhi Co. suspends or discontinues your subscription to the Subscription Services, Yoga

Buddhi Co. may, in its sole discretion, provide you with a credit, refund, discount or other form of

consideration (for example, we may credit additional days of service to your account). However,

if Yoga Buddhi Co. terminates your account or suspends or discontinues your access to

Services due to your violation of these Terms, then you will not be eligible for any such credit,

refund, discount or other consideration.

Please note that if you purchase a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone

application, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will additionally be

subject to Apple’s applicable payment policy, which also may not provide for refunds. Please

note that if you purchase a subscription through the Android Play Store or Amazon store, the

sale is final, and we will not provide a refund. Your purchase will additionally be subject to

Android’s or Amazon’s applicable payment policy, respectively, which also may not provide for

Yoga Buddhi Co. offers monthly, annual, and lifetime subscription options. For the purposes of

those subscriptions, a month constitutes 30 calendar days, a year constitutes 365 calendar

days, and a lifetime constitutes access to the Services available at the time of purchase for as

long as those Services remain available. You may not assign lifetime subscriptions to any other

person. Yoga Buddhi Co. makes no warranties or representations as to the expected lifetime of

the Services, and in purchasing a lifetime subscription, you acknowledge and agree that the

Services could change or terminate in the future.

Our monthly subscriptions are paid in monthly installments. For each month that your

monthly subscription is active, you acknowledge and agree that Yoga Buddhi is

authorized to charge the same credit card or other payment method (the “Payment

Method”) as was used for the initial subscription fee in the amount of the then current

monthly subscription fee. The monthly renewal subscription fees will continue to be

billed to the Payment Method you provided, automatically until cancelled. You must

cancel your subscription before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next

month's subscription fee to the Payment Method you provided. Refunds cannot be

claimed for any partial-month subscription period.

Our annual subscriptions are paid for by an upfront one-off payment with automatic

annual renewals respectively. You acknowledge and agree that Yoga Buddhi is

authorized to charge the Payment Method used for the initial annual subscription fee at

the rate secured at the time of purchase. This includes discounted rates secured with a

promotional offer. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid

billing of the renewal subscription fee to the Payment Method you provided. Refunds

cannot be claimed for any partial subscription period.

Our lifetime subscriptions are paid for by an upfront one-off payment. You acknowledge

and agree that Yoga Buddhi is authorized to charge the Payment Method used for the

lifetime subscription fee at the rate secured at the time of purchase. This includes

discounted rates secured with a promotional offer.

You agree to promptly notify Yoga Buddhi of any changes to the Payment Method you provided

while any subscriptions remain outstanding. You are responsible for all applicable fees and

charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all subscriptions purchased by you.

Yoga Buddhi uses a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to link your credit

card account to the Service. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection

with your use of the Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the

Payment Processor and your credit card issuer in addition to these Terms. Yoga Buddhi is not

responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor. In connection with your use of the

Service, Yoga Buddhi will obtain certain transaction details, which Yoga Buddhi will use solely in

accordance with its Privacy Policy.

Our obligation to provide a Subscription Service only comes into being when we take receipt of

your order. You agree not to hold us responsible for banking charges incurred due to payments

on your account. If payment is not received by us from the Payment Method you provided, you

agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. You agree that you are not permitted to resell

any parts of the Service for commercial purposes.



Changes in Fees

We may at any time and from time to time, in our sole discretion, change the fees and charges,

or add new fees and charges, in relation to any of the Services. We will notify you by email at

least 30 calendar days in advance of any such change if the change will affect the amount you

are charged for the Services. If you do not agree to the change, you may cancel your

membership as described below.
