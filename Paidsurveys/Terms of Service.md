Unless otherwise provided below, the revised terms will take effect when they are posted. Your continued use of the Service will signify your acceptance to the modified terms. Please review the terms on this website frequently to look for changes.

#### 1\. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

PaidSurveys currently provides users with access to a rich collection of resources, including, various communications tools, forums, shopping services, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties (the “Service”). You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for PaidSurveys to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from PaidSurveys and PSD Research, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the PaidSurveys Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of PaidSurveys membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new PaidSurveys properties, shall be subject to the Terms of Use. You understand and agree that the Service is provided “AS-IS” and that PaidSurveys assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.
