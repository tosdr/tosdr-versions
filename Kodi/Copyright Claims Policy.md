Kodi DMCA Policy
================

DMCA - Notification of Copyright Infringement
---------------------------------------------

This page contains the formal requirements of the Copyright Act with respect to the rights of copyright owners whose content appears on the official websites of the Kodi Foundation or within the unmodified official Kodi application without authorization and instruction to copyright owners.

Details Required for a Filing
-----------------------------

To file a copyright infringement notification with the Kodi Foundation (also commonly known as a "DMCA Takedown Notice"), the copyright owner or an authorized agent acting on his or her behalf will need to send a written communication that includes the following information:

1. The details of the copyright owner or of a person officially authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, including an electronic signature (or alternatively a scan of the physical signature).
    
2. Identification of the original work that is claimed to have been infringed, including a URL link to the work. If multiple copyrighted works from a single source are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works (with links) at that site may be substituted.
    
3. Specifics of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. URLs directly addressing the material are requested to identify the items in question.
    
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party. The preference is for an electronic mail address, but an address or telephone number at which the complaining party may be contacted can also be used.
    
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
    
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
    

How to File the DMCA Takedown Notice
------------------------------------

The notice containing the information detailed above should be sent by email to the Kodi Foundation at the following email address:

Email: [\[email protected\]](https://kodi.tv/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability. Consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of 17 U.S.C. to clarify or confirm the requirements of the notice.

Only the copyright owner or their directly appointed and authorized agent may make a DMCA takedown notice.

Third Party Sites and Content
-----------------------------

Please note that if the copyright media in question is in a third party website not under the control of the Kodi Foundation, or if it is contained in a third party add-on or repository that is not hosted within the official Kodi Foundation repository, then the Kodi Foundation has no responsibility or liability for it.

In such cases, any DMCA takedown request should be made to the author and/or owner of the addon, repository or website.

For cases where an addon or repository in question is hosted within the Kodi Foundation repository, then the Kodi Foundation will aim to assist in identifying the author of the item, and will work with all parties to resolve the issue, and if required remove the item from the official repository.

Counter-Notification
--------------------

If you want to send the Kodi Foundation a counter notice, please review this information for instructions.

Under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

Please consult the Kodi Foundation Terms of Service in which we explain that you may be removed from the site if you are a repeat infringer or if you violate the Kodi Foundation policies.
