The Bright Cellars Experience
-----------------------------

Bright Cellars is primarily a wine subscription service, but you can shop our Online Store without subscribing to the Service. The subscription Service matches you with unique wines based on your individual preferences. If you subscribe to the Service, you will automatically receive new wines chosen specifically for you! Members are able to adjust their account at any time by contacting our Wine Concierge team or directly through their account login. Members of the Concierge Team are available Monday - Friday between 9:00am CT and 5:00pm CT by phone 1-844-223-5527 or [by email](https://help.brightcellars.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). If you contact us outside of these hours, your message will be addressed during business hours on a first come, first served basis.

We currently accept major credit cards for payment. The credit card you provide for your subscription will be charged when your order is processed. If the issuer of your card refuses to or does not, for any reason, authorize payment to us, or we are otherwise unable to charge your card, we will not process and ship your monthly selections and will not be liable to you for any delay or non-delivery of your order.

 YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE AND AUTHORIZE CHARGES TO ANY CREDIT CARD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AND THAT YOU WILL KEEP SUCH ACCOUNT INFORMATION CURRENT AND ACCURATE SO AS TO ALLOW US TO CHARGE THE ACCOUNT IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.  

By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions authorized by you. We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to update information regarding your card, such as an updated card number or expiration date, utilizing one or more third party services.

YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR UPDATE YOUR ACCOUNT ONLINE IF YOUR CARD CHANGES, IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR PAYMENT CARD, EMAIL ADDRESS OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE IN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE US ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR PAYMENT CARD, UNLESS WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR MEMBERSHIP IN THE SERVICE. 

Changing and Canceling Orders
-----------------------------

If you would like to make changes to a recurring order (including shipping address, billing information, wine preference, etc.) please contact us at [concierge@brightcellars.com](mailto:concierge@brightcellars.com) or update online by logging into your account within four (4) days of receiving your reminder email. 

For all other orders and/or once an order has been processed, we can no longer accept changes or cancellations.

THE RISK OF LOSS OF ANY PRODUCT SHALL PASS TO YOU AS SOON AS YOUR ORDER IS DELIVERED TO THE DELIVERY ADDRESS YOU PROVIDE. IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND CORRECT SHIPPING ADDRESS ACCESSIBLE TO COMMON CARRIERS FOR DELIVERY OF YOUR ORDER. YOU HEREBY RELEASE US FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN THE EVENT YOU (A) PROVIDE AN INCORRECT DELIVERY ADDRESS DURING THE ENROLMENT PROCESS AND/OR (B) FAIL TO COLLECT THE PRODUCTS FROM THE DELIVERY ADDRESS YOU PROVIDE DURING THE ENROLMENT PROCESS.  

Coupons, Discounts, and Multiple Accounts
-----------------------------------------

Our mission at Bright Cellars is to make wine accessible and fun, particularly if you're just starting out in the wine world. To help support this mission, introductory promotions may be offered for new subscriptions. Each new member is eligible for one introductory promotion per household. Maintaining multiple accounts to continue receiving introductory promotions is strictly prohibited. Further, our subscription program is intended for individual, personal use only and not for resale or wholesale purposes. If we learn or believe that any person or entity has or may violate these Terms including, but not limited to, purchasing products for resale or wholesale, we, in addition to any rights to which we may be entitled in law or equity, reserve the right to cancel any orders and/or accounts without any liability.

Promotions are offered at the discretion of Bright Cellars. Any discounts or coupons are non-transferrable, may not be bartered or sold, may not be used in conjunction with any other offers or used more than once, and are not applicable to successive accounts if a member signs up for multiple subscriptions. Discounts are applicable to the number of orders represented in the promotion of wine subscriptions.

Special Offers/Promotions
-------------------------

Bright Cellars may offer limited time promotions sent via text or email. These orders are not guaranteed to match up with individual preferences. Bright Cellars Gift Cards may not be applied towards these offers. Special requests cannot be honored outside of the offer. Example: For an offer of a half red, half white case of wine, a request for 8 red wines and 4 white wines cannot be honored.

Shipping
--------

 All Bright Cellars wine orders require an adult signature upon delivery. FedEx/UPS will not accept a signature or note left on your door, so someone 21+ will need to be present for your delivery. Be prepared to show a government issued photo ID & sign for the package.

 Unfortunately, we are unable to have your package delivered to a P.O Box or any USPS locations since our packages do require a signature.

 Bright Cellars orders are subject to local law and regulation restrictions and may only be delivered to select states within the contiguous United States. Please [contact us](https://help.brightcellars.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you have a question about shipping.

Weather Delays
--------------

Severe weather conditions can impact the delivery date of your order. To ensure orders arrive in the best possible condition, our fulfillment center may delay shipping if the forecast predicts extreme conditions. If you have any questions about weather delays, please contact the Concierge Team.

Undeliverable Packages
----------------------

 UPS and/or FedEx will make three delivery attempts. If you miss all three delivery attempts, these shippers will return your order to Bright Cellars. 

 Any packages returned to Bright Cellars may be eligible for a partial refund at Bright Cellars’ discretion. The total for a partial refund will include the cost of your order minus a $25 returned shipment fee.

Gift Card Policy
----------------

All gift card purchases are final sale and may not be returned for credit or refund. If your gift card recipient lives in a state to which we are unable to ship\*, you will not be able to complete your transaction. Gift codes/cards purchased from third-party sellers will not be honored.

 _\*Gift cards are not available for purchase if the recipient’s shipping address is in one of the following states: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Utah. Additionally, gift card purchase availability is subject to the same local law and regulation restrictions as our subscription service. Please [contact us](https://help.brightcellars.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you have a question about shipping._

Member Rewards Program
----------------------

Bright Cellars members are eligible to receive and redeem points earned from various activities related to their account, such as rating wines and referring new members. Points are awarded by Bright Cellars for promotional and loyalty purposes only and are redeemable for items and discounts specified on our Rewards page. Points have no cash value, are non-transferrable, may not be bartered or sold or redeemed for cash, may not be pooled with points of other individuals (across multiple accounts). The point values of rewardable actions, or the point values of redeemable rewards, may change at any time. Items purchased by point redemption may not be returned or refunded, with the exception of damaged or defective products. Bright Cellars reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Rewards Program at any time. 

Delight Guarantee
-----------------

For Active Subscription Members, in the event you are not satisfied with a bottle in your subscription order, please reach out to the Concierge team. We are happy to add reward points (not to exceed 800 reward points per order) to your account to make up for anything that you might have found unsatisfactory. This guarantee is limited to 4 orders per year per active member.

Refunds and Returns
-------------------

While most items are not refundable, if you received a damaged or defective product, or if your shipment was never delivered, we may issue a refund at our discretion if we are notified within 30 days of the order date. Please be aware that gift card purchases are non-refundable.

 If your package has been marked as delivered, the Concierge Team is no longer able to make any changes to the order. Any delivered packages are not eligible for returns. To avoid this, look out for your order receipt each month!

Dispute Resolution – Mandatory Arbitration/Class Action Waiver
--------------------------------------------------------------

* General. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and us in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, subject to the Exceptions set forth in sub-section B below, you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Site or Services, including without limitation, your receipt of text messages from us or our service providers will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms, or your receipt of text messages from Bright Cellars or its service providers whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of when a claim arises. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BRIGHT CELLARS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT DISPUTES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. 

* Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (A) above, nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of you or Bright Cellars to: (i) bring an individual (non-class) action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. In such case, any such action will be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, without regard to any conflict-of-law provisions and brought, heard and resolved by a state or federal court located in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, USA and the parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose.

* Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Bright Cellars will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Messaging Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Bright Cellars. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

* Notice; Process. If you or Bright Cellars intends to seek arbitration, then the party seeking arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). Bright Cellars address for Notice is: 313 N. Plankinton Ave. Ste 207, Milwaukee, WI 53203, Attn: Dawn Miedler. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and Bright Cellars will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Bright Cellars do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Bright Cellars may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Bright Cellars must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

* Fees. If you commence arbitration, Bright Cellars will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Bright Cellars for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. You and Bright Cellars agree that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from you or Bright Cellars made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

* No Class Actions. YOU AND BRIGHT CELLARS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Bright Cellars agree otherwise in a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 

* Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Dispute Resolution Section, if Bright Cellars makes any future change to this Section, other than a change to Bright Cellars address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Bright Cellars address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Bright Cellars.

* Enforceability. If an arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations above (addressing class, representative and consolidated proceedings) as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. If any other provision of this Section is found to be unenforceable, the applicable provision shall be deemed stricken and the remainder of this Section shall remain in full force and effect.

Miscellaneous
-------------

These Terms and policies incorporated herein are the entire agreement between you and Bright Cellars. They supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Bright Cellars relating to your use of the Site or the Service. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. The failure of Bright Cellars to exercise any rights partially or fully, or the waiver of Bright Cellars of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by Bright Cellars or be deemed a waiver by Bright Cellars of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies of Bright Cellars under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and Bright Cellars shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit Bright Cellars' right to exercise any other right or remedy.
