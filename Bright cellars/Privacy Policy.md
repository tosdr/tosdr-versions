Your privacy is important to us. Please read this Bright Cellars Privacy Policy ("**Policy**") to learn about what data we collect, how we collect your information, how we use your data, who we share it with, how we protect it, and your rights around the data. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. By using our Services, you agree to this Policy. This Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of our Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes. Please check the Policy periodically for updates.

What Information We Collect? When you use our Services, we may collect information that that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly, or indirectly, to you ("**Personal Information**"). This does not include aggregated or de-identified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked with you.

Identifiers, such as real names, aliases, postal addresses, online usernames, email addresses, account names, driver's license numbers, social security numbers, passport numbers or other similar identifiers. Characteristics of protected classifications under California or Federal Law, such as age, race, gender identity, or gender expression. Commercial information, such as records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies. Internet or other electronic network activity, including but not limited to, browsing history, IP addresses, and information regarding interactions with a website, or application. Geolocation data How We Collect Information We collect the above listed categories of personal information from you when you use our Services. Additionally, the inferences we create come from our analysis of the information you provide to us. We collect information from the following sources:

_**Information You Provide Us**_

* **Account Creation**: Your name, email, phone number, and other relevant information when you create an account. We may also collect information relating to the actions that you perform while logged into your account. You may visit our Site anonymously without signing in.
* **Order Placement**: When you order or register on our Site, you may be asked to enter your name, email, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information.
* **Customer Support**: If you contact us for assistance or support, we may collect your name, email address, phone number or any other content that you send us.
* **Mailing List Subscription**: If you subscribe to our mailing list or newsletters, we will collect your address.
* **Social Media**: If you interact with our social media accounts, we might collect your social media handle and related information.
* **Participation in contests, promotions, sweepstakes, and surveys**: If you choose to participate in our contests, surveys, promotions, or sweepstakes, we will collect information provided by you such as survey responses and contact information

_**Information Collected Automatically**_

* **Log Data**: When you use our Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser software version or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.
    
* **Mobile Devices**: We may collect information from your mobile device, such as unique identifying information broadcast from your device when visiting our Services.
    
* **Location Data**: When you use our Services, we may solicit your permission to collect your location data. Some features within our Services may only function upon confirmation of your location, and therefore such features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data. The specificity of the location data may depend on several factors, including the device you are using and how your connected to the Internet. If you enable location services for our Services, we may collect location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. Depending on the platform you use to access our mobile applications you may be able to control whether location data is collected with certain settings on your device.
    
* **Cookies and Similar Technology**: We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites. We may combine this information with other Personal Information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf).
    
    * **Cookies**. "Cookies" are small data files stored on your own computer's hard drive. We (and our third-party providers) use cookies to facilitate the operation of our Site (e.g., as part of the account login features), to personalize the content we display to you, and for analytics, marketing, and advertising purposes. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. If you choose to reject cookies, certain functions and applications on our Site may not work properly. The Bright Cellars website uses cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart including when you have abandoned your cart and this information is used to determine when to send cart reminder messages via SMS.
        
    * **Pixel Tags**. Pixel tags (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, though, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages, not stored on your hard drive. We might use clear GIFs to track the activities of users of our Site, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third-party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
        
* **Third-Party Analytics**. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, (for more information, click here) to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to our visitors' needs, and to detect suspicious activity. We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your Personal Information with these third parties.
    
    _The above excludes text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties._
    
* **DO NOT TRACK**. Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether you intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether you even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not act in response to these signals.
    

_**Information Collected Automatically**_

**Activity and Usage Information**: We may receive information from third parties, such as technical service and analytics providers, on your interests, browsing behavior, and other navigation data, such as advertisements viewed and websites visited, to customize content and advertising.
