FAQs

When did Bright Cellars become part of Winc?

Bright Cellars customers officially joined the Winc Family in October 2024!

Are the benefits I had with my Bright Cellars subscription the same with Winc?

Winc members enjoy similar benefits to Bright Cellars such as a satisfaction guarantee policy and self-service functionality like swapping bottles or skipping your upcoming order. Additionally, Winc offers their members extra perks like free shipping on 4+ bottles, 10% off all orders of 12+ bottles as well as access to more wines from around the world!

Will my Bright Cellars subscription automatically transfer to Winc?

Yes, your Bright Cellars subscription, along with all your account information and order history, will automatically transfer to Winc within 30 days of the migration. You won’t need to do anything—your subscription will continue as usual.

How is the transition from Bright Cellars to Winc affecting my subscription?

The transition from Bright Cellars to Winc will have very little impact on your subscription. You’ll still receive your wines on the same schedule, but now with even more perks! You’ll have access to a much larger selection of wines from around the world, free shipping on subscription orders of 4 or more bottles, the ability to easily swap bottles or skip an order, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all orders!

Will the cost of my subscription change with Winc?

As a Winc member, you'll be billed based on the wines in your order, typically ranging from $16-$20 per bottle, offering you savings compared to Bright Cellars pricing. You'll also enjoy free shipping on all subscription orders of 4+ bottles, plus an additional 10% off orders of 12 or more bottles!

Can I still pause or cancel my subscription as easily as I could with Bright Cellars?

Yes, Winc membership offers convenient self-service features, including the ability to swap bottles, skip your upcoming order, and a no-commitment policy, allowing you to cancel anytime. Feel free to reach out to [support@winc.com](mailto: support@winc.com) if you need help with any of these requests!
