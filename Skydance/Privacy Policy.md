1) California Privacy Rights Notice
-----------------------------------

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides rights to certain individuals located in California. You can contact us about these rights at [privacy@skydance.com](mailto:privacy@skydance.com) or [here](http://skydance.com/privacy-dsar) . Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.). This Privacy Policy serves as our pre-collection notice under CCPA, unless additional notice is provided at the point of collection, except regarding our California job applicants, and current and former employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”), for which a separate privacy notice is available from human resources.  

### California Rights

California residents, including our Personnel, may have the following rights:

#### Right to access 

You may have the right to know and see what data we have collected about you over the past 12 months prior to the request date including:

categories of Personal Information we collected about you;

categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information;

the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing your Personal Information;

the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your Personal Information;

the categories of Personal Information disclosed for a business purpose and for each, the categories for recipients, or that no disclosure occurred; 

the categories of Personal Information sold or shared about you and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale or share occurred; and

the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you.

#### Right to deletion

You have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information, subject to our retention rights. Our retention rights include, without limitation:

* to complete transactions and services you have requested;
* for security purposes;
* for legitimate internal business purposes (e.g., maintaining business records);
* to comply with law and to cooperate with law enforcement; and
* to exercise or defend legal claims.

Please also be aware that making a deletion request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or deletion of Personal Information or content you may have posted.

Note also that, under the applicable law, we may not be required to delete your PI that we did not Collect directly from you.  

#### Right to correct

You have the right to bring inaccuracies you find in the Personal Information that we maintain to our attention and we will act upon such a complaint as required by applicable law.

#### Right to be free from discrimination

You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.

#### Right to opt-out of sale/share

We may sell or share your Personal Information as those terms are defined by the CCPA. However, we provide consumers an opt out of sale/sharing that is intended to combine both of these opt-outs (sale and sharing) into a single opt-out (sale/sharing). Opt-outs to non-cookie Personal Information and cookie Personal Information must be effectuated separately as outlined below.

#### Opt-out for non-cookie Personal Information

If you want to opt-out of the sale/sharing of your non-cookie Personal Information (e.g., your email address), make an opt-out request [here](http://skydance.com/privacy-dsar).  

#### Opt-out for cookie Personal Information

If you want to opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of your cookie-related Personal Information, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on the cookie management tool available via a “Cookies” and/or “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of the homepage of the applicable Website. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie Personal Information and to non-cookie Personal Information.   Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use.  Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.  Beware that if you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit our Services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool.  

#### Opt-out preference signals 

California requires businesses to process opt-out preference signals (“OOPS”) (also known as Global Privacy Control signals or GPC), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the sale and sharing of Personal Information. To use an OOPS/ GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/ GPC.  We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process OOPS/ GPC signals on our website. We process OOPS/GPC with respect to sales and sharing that may occur in the context of collection of cookie Personal Information by tracking technologies online by Third-Party Digital Businesses, discussed below, and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We currently do not, due to technical limitations,  process OOPS/GPC for opt-outs of sales and sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie Personal Information).  We do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our Service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; (2) change your experience with any product or service if you use OOPS/GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC, apart from displaying that we recognize the signal. 

We do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of consumers under 16, unless we receive affirmative authorization (“opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years old, or the parent or guardian of a consumer who is less than 13 years old. If you think we may have unknowingly collected Personal Information of a consumer under 16 years old, please contact us as described below in the Contacting Skydance section.

We may disclose your Personal Information for the following purposes, which are not a sale or share:  (i) if you direct us to disclose Personal Information; (ii) to comply with a consumer rights request you submit to us; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Skydance as defined above, or as part of a Corporate Transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.

#### Right to limit sensitive Personal Information processing

We only process Sensitive Personal Information (as that term is defined under the CCPA) for purposes that are exempt from consumer choice under the CCPA.

#### Automated Decision Making/Profiling

We do not engage in Automated Decision Making or Profiling.

### Making a Request Under the CCPA

To submit a request to exercise your Consumer privacy rights, or to submit a request as an authorized agent, use our U.S. Data Subject Action Request Form, or e-mail us at privacy@skydance.com, and respond to any follow-up inquiries we make. Please be aware that we do not accept or process requests through other means (e.g., via fax, chats, social media etc.).  

To request access or deletion of your Personal Information, or to exercise any other data rights under the CCPA, please email us at with your first and last name. Please specify your particular data request.

You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request.

### Additional Notice for California Residents

In addition to the CCPA, certain Californians are entitled to certain other notices, as follows: 

This Notice provides information on our online practices and your California rights specific to our online services. Without limitation, Californians that visit our online services and seek to acquire goods, services, money or credit for personal, family or household purposes are entitled to the following notices of their rights:

#### California Minors

Although our services are intended for an audience over the age of majority, any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use our services, and posted content on the service, can request removal by contacting us as described below in the Contacting Skydance section, detailing where the content is posted and attesting you posted it. We will then make reasonably good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines we do not control.

#### Shine the Light 

We may disclose “personal information,” as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law, to third parties for such third parties own direct marketing purposes. California residents may opt-out of this sharing by contacting us at privacy@skydance.com or 2900 Olympic Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90404 (Attn: Privacy). You must put the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the body of your correspondence. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. This right is different than, and in addition to, CCPA rights, and must be requested separately. However, a Do Not Sell/Share opt-out is broader and will limit our disclosing to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without the need for making a separate Shine the Light request. We will not accept Shine the Light requests by telephone or by fax, and are not responsible for requests not labeled or sent properly, or that are incomplete. 

2) UK/EEA Supplemental Notice for our Skydance Games
----------------------------------------------------

Most of our Services are not directed UK or EEA data subjects and are not subjects to those jurisdiction’s privacy laws.  However, that is not always the case for Skydance Interactive, LLC and Skydance Silicon Valley LLC (collectively “Skydance Games”).  With respect to Skydance Games’ UK/EEA personal data practices and corresponding data subject rights see [here](http://skydance.com/privacy-policy-uk-eea/) .   Skydance Games Websites that are directed to UK or EEA users will also post a cookie statement, which is located in the [UK/EEA Supplemental Notice](http://skydance.com/privacy-policy-uk-eea/), that supplements this Privacy Policy.  Where the UK/EEA supplemental notice or cookie statement apply, they will govern in the event of a conflict with the main Privacy Policy for applicable data subjects. This UK/EEA supplemental notice is not intended to, and does not, apply to any human resources-related personal data that may be processed by UK/EEA Skydance entities.

3) Information We Collect via the Services
------------------------------------------

We collect information about you in several ways. We use this information to operate and enhance your experience with the Services.

### Information Automatically Collected

#### Collection of Usage Information 

When users come to our Services, we may automatically collect “Usage Information” about how you use and interact with the Services. For example, when you access the Services, we may log which pages of our Website were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Services. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, phone, tablet or other device used to access the Services (any, “Device”), operating system and browser software used by each user of the Services. We may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the user’s point of connectivity.  We may also use third-party Vendors (defined below) such as Google Analytics to automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device, and how you use and interact with the Services. We collect this technical data to analyze usage trends and give us more information about how people use the Services to better the user experience.

#### Technology used on the Services

We also may use cookies, web beacons,  embedded scripts and or other tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) for operational purposes such as to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Website links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Services, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use, and to help us serve more relevant ads to you off of the Service. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Services and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Services and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some features, and functionalities of the Services may not work. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Services, count the number of visitors to the Services, and count content views, and related functionalities. These web beacons can be embedded into the Services and e-mail messages. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. Tracking Technologies  allow Skydance to serve you better and more efficiently, such as  to personalize your experience at our Website and when you receive ads from us on third party services.

#### Tracking Options 

You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies.  In addition, our Websites include a cookie preference tool that enables you to control cookies associated with the Website that are not essential to the Website’s operation.  Click on the “Your Privacy Rights” link on the Website footer to access this tool. If you reject our cookies, certain functions and conveniences of our  Website may not work properly, but you do not have to accept our cookies in order to use many features of the Website. You can also consult  the “Help” menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to change your tracking settings or cookie preferences via that browser. On your mobile device, you can adjust your privacy and advertising settings to limit your tracking for advertising or control whether you receive more relevant advertising. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use.  Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. Currently, our systems do not recognize “Do Not Track” requests, however see the California Privacy Rights Notice above as to how we treat browser Global Privacy Control signals.

You may choose whether to receive some of this advertising by submitting opt-outs.  Some of the advertisers and Vendors that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit [**http://www.aboutads.info/choices/**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) , and [**http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices**](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices)  for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads).

We may also use Microsoft Advertising Services. To learn about the data Microsoft collects and how your data is used by it and to opt-out of certain Microsoft browser Interest-based Advertising, please visit [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) We may also use Google Ad Services. To learn more about the data Google collects and how your data is used by it and to optout of certain Google browser Interest-Based Advertising, please visit [here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) .

In addition, we may serve ads on other online services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our data bases (“Matched List Ads”).  This is done by using Tracking Technologies or by matching common factors between our data bases and the data bases of the other online services.  For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Facebook or X (formerly Twitter) and other Third-Party Services.  We are not responsible for these Third-Party Services, including without limitation their security of the data.  If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad, or go to your account settings, and find out what options Facebook offers you to control such ads.  If we use X Matched List Ads, you should be able to review your ad options in account settings on X. We are not responsible for such third parties’ failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions, they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.

Skydance is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options, choices, or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

### Information You Give Us

We may collect Personal Information you choose to provide to us. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information you submit to Skydance. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Services, the information you receive when using the Services, and our ability to contact you.

If you opt to subscribe to our email updates and newsletters, you may be required to provide us with your name and email address. Several locations of the Services permit you to enter your email address for specified purposes, including to receive news and updates from Skydance.  Without limitation, this may include:

If you choose to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotions (“Promotions”) that Skydance offers on or through the Website, you may be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such Promotions. This information may include your name, age, mailing address, email address, and phone number. We may use this information to notify contest and sweepstakes winners and to award prizes. Your participation in a contest or sweepstakes is completely voluntary, so you have a choice of whether to participate and disclose information to us.

* COMMUNICATIONS WITH SKYDANCE. You may also provide us information, including your name, email and any other information you choose to include, when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us. We may use this information to respond to your request or otherwise interact with you.

You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social networking sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how such third-party sites treat your Personal Information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.

If you opt-out of marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails and notifications, which may include information about your account, our business dealings with you, and updates regarding our policies.

5) Disclosure  of Personal Information
--------------------------------------

Information disclosed to Skydance Games Services may also be subject to the privacy policy of the specific Skydance Game Service. To the extent that the privacy policy of the Skydance Games Service conflicts with this Privacy Policy, the privacy policy of the Skydance Games Service controls as to the conflict. 

We may disclose the Personal Information we collect from and about you (1) to fulfill the purpose for which you provided it; (2) with your consent; (3) for legal, protection, and safety purposes; (4) to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; (5) to send you marketing communications, subject to your communication choices and the rights of California residents. However, absent your consent (which may be by means of opt-in, your election not to opt-out, or a third party interaction described in the next bullet point), however, Skydance will not share your Personal Information directly collected by Skydance from you on the Services with third parties, other than Skydance affiliates, for their own direct marketing purposes, except in connection with Corporate Transactions (defined below); and (5) with those who need it to do work for us (our Vendors, as defined below).

In addition, Skydance may share your Personal Information, in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing of our business, or merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of Skydance assets, or transfer of all or a portion of Skydance’s business to another company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding (“Corporate Transactions”).We may contract with third parties to perform functions related to the Services (“Vendors”). Vendors will have access to your Personal Information needed to perform their business functions but may not use or share that Personal Information for other purposes. For example, Vendors may include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content related to the operation and maintenance of the Services.

6) External Links
-----------------

The Services may include or link to third-party websites, apps, locations, platforms, code (e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces (“API”), and software development kits (“SDKs”)) or other services (“Third-Party Service(s)”). These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you.  

Certain functionalities on the Services permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and certain Third-Party Services, such as third party social networks (“Social Features”).  Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Services and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” Skydance’s content; logging in to the Services using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Services); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Services).  If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Services or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Skydance or a media property in a tweet, story, thread, or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Services or otherwise by Skydance.  Also, both Skydance and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Service. 

Skydance may engage and work with Vendors and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on other online services.  Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of precise location and/or Cross-device Data, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“Interest-based Advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).  We may use Microsoft and Google for advertising services. See Section 3 \[Link\] for more information on your choices regarding certain personalized advertising.

Skydance may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other Vendors for analytics services.  These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help Skydance analyze users of our Services and how they use the Services.  Information generated by these analytics services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Vendors on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Vendors may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Services, compiling statistic reports on the Services’ activity, and providing other services relating to Services activity and other Internet usage. See Section 3 \[Link\] for more information on your choices regarding these services. 

Skydance is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Vendors and Third-Party Services associated with the Services, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.  See Section 3 above for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Interest-based Advertising and analytics.
