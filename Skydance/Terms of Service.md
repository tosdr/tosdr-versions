12.  Copyright Policy

The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Skydance to locate the material on the Website; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details.

Additional terms may apply to non-U.S. users.

14.  Term, Updates, and Termination
-----------------------------------

These Terms of Use are effective from the date that you first access the Website or submit any information to Skydance via the Website, whichever is earlier, and shall remain effective until terminated in accordance with these Terms of Use. Skydance may immediately terminate these Terms of Use, and/or your access to and use of the Website, or any portion thereof, at any time and for any reason, with or without cause, without prior notice. Skydance may also terminate these Terms of Use immediately if you fail to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Use. Upon termination of these Terms of Use by either party, your right to use the Website shall immediately cease, and you shall destroy all copies of information that you have obtained from the Website, whether made under the terms of these Terms of Use or otherwise. All disclaimers and all limitations of liability, and all Skydance rights of ownership, shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms of Use.

It is your responsibility to review the posted Terms of Use and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Website (at least prior to each transaction or submission). EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE WEBSITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS OF USE AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF NEW TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE WEBSITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE NEW TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Any new Terms or Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised, or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You can reject any new, revised or additional terms by discontinuing use of the Website.

15.  Arbitration/Governing Law/Class Action Waiver
--------------------------------------------------

Except to the extent limited by applicable law:

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding that body of law relating to conflict of laws. The parties agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, or the breach thereof, (collectively, “Dispute”) will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1280 et seq., and the then-current rules and procedures of JAMS. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public. The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles County, California and be conducted in the English language. The decision rendered by the arbitrator will be binding upon the parties hereto, and any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of all federal and state courts in California. Venue will lie exclusively in Los Angeles County, California. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this paragraph shall affect Skydance’s ability to seek from a court injunctive or equitable relief at any time. These Terms of Use and any other Dispute brought by you against Skydance or by Skydance against you, or otherwise related to the Website, Skydance products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction, unless the applicable laws of your jurisdiction of residence require that the laws of such jurisdiction govern, in which case the laws of such jurisdiction are to govern.  This section shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. You and Skydance agree that we intend that this section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This section can only be amended by mutual agreement.  Either party may seek enforcement of this section in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.

If any arbitration or other proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret these Terms of Use or matters relating to it, the substantially prevailing party, as determined by the arbitrator’s award, will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred in such arbitration or proceeding from the other party, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party is entitled; provided that in no event will the arbitrator have the authority to award punitive damages.

Both you and Skydance waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this section is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.

**AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.**
