NETGEAR Terms and Conditions


================================

**Please read these NETGEAR Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) carefully. This agreement affects your rights.**  
  
**IF YOU USE THE NETGEAR PRODUCT (AS DEFINED BELOW) YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.**  
  
**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DISCONTINUE USE AND RETURN THE PRODUCT IN GOOD CONDITION WITHIN THIRTY (30) CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ORIGINAL PURCHASE FOR A REFUND. REFER TO SECTION 7 FOR SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATIONS.**  
  
These Terms and Conditions are between you (“ **You** ” or “ **User** ”) and NETGEAR, Inc. (for the Americas) or NETGEAR International Limited (for all other territories including but not limited to Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand) concerning Your use of (including any access to) devices or services (including software included in Your device at the time of purchase), and other information and materials provided on or in connection with such devices or services, including firmware, documentation, graphics, illustrations, pictures, photographs, audio, and videos (individually and collectively, the “ **Product** ” or “ **Products** ”) provided by NETGEAR, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “ **NETGEAR** ” or “ **Company** ”). In some instances, both these Terms and Conditions and separate terms will apply to Your use of the Product (“Additional Terms”). To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless they expressly state otherwise.

**[ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION TERMS FOR NETGEAR ARMOR](#Netgear-Armor-terms)**

**[ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION TERMS FOR NETGEAR PROSUPPORT FOR HOME](#Netgear-Prosupport-terms)**

**[ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION TERMS FOR NETGEAR GEARHEAD FOR HOME](#Netgear-Gearhead-terms)**

**[ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION TERMS FOR NETGEAR MEURAL CANVAS EXTENDED WARRANTY](#Netgear-Meural-terms)**

**[ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR NETGEAR E-STORE](#Netgear-E-store-terms)**

Your consent to these Terms and Conditions is required in order to use Your NETGEAR Product. If You do not accept these Terms and Conditions, You must return the Product in good condition within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of original purchase for a refund. Refer to Section 7 for Subscription Cancellations.  
  
**YOU AGREE TO THE MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISIONS, DESCRIBED FULLY IN SECTION 3, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH NETGEAR.**  
  
**IF YOU SIGN UP FOR ANY NETGEAR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, YOU FURTHER AGREE, AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 6.4, THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SAME APPLICABLE TERM AND PRICE, UNTIL YOU CANCEL.**

##### 1.    ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.1    These Terms and Conditions may be accepted by clicking the “I accept” button or checking a checkbox if such button or function is available or present via the user interface for the respective Product. You also accept the Terms and Conditions when You access or start to use the Product.  
  
1.2    By using the Product, You affirm that You are of legal age to enter into these Terms and Conditions. You may not use the Product if You are a: (a) person who is not of legal age or otherwise not entitled to form a binding contract with NETGEAR, or (b) person who is barred from receiving the Product under the laws of any country including the country in which You are a resident or from which You are using the Product.  
  
1.3    If You are an individual accessing or using the Product on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or other entity with which You are associated (an “Organization”), then You are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of Yourself and such Organization, and You represent and warrant that You have the legal authority to bind such Organization to these Terms and Conditions. References to “You” and “Your” in these Terms and Conditions will refer to both the individual using the Services and to any such Organization.

##### 2.    INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION

2.1    NETGEAR would like an opportunity to address Your concerns without a formal legal case. **Before filing a claim against NETGEAR, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting [legal@netgear.com](mailto:legal@netgear.com)** . NETGEAR will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting You in writing via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission to this email address, You or NETGEAR may bring a formal proceeding.

##### 3.    DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER

3.1    You and NETGEAR agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising out of, in connection with, or relating to NETGEAR’s Terms and Conditions, Products, and relationship with You, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or efficacy of the NETGEAR Products. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. This agreement includes any claims against NETGEAR’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of NETGEAR. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts.  
  
3.2    To the extent possible under Your local law, the arbitration will take place in Santa Clara County, California. The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. NETGEAR’s Products and relationship with You involve interstate commerce, and this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 _et seq._).  
  
**3.3    CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND NETGEAR AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.**  
  
3.4    Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, consolidated action or private attorney general action. This arbitration agreement does not stop You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, who may seek relief against us on Your behalf. If this specific provision, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” is found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.  
  
3.5    Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You agree that if NETGEAR makes any future, material change to this arbitration provision, You may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to **[legal@netgear.com](mailto:legal@netgear.com)** . Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which You have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.  
  
3.6    This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to [**legal@netgear.com**](mailto:legal@netgear.com) within thirty (30) calendar days of purchasing Your NETGEAR Product.  
  
3.7    Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

##### 4.    CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

4.1    NETGEAR may at its discretion modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Each such modification will take immediate effect upon notification to You. NETGEAR may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions, by email, regular mail, text message, updating its website, or other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed.  
  
4.2    Your continued use of the Product following any such notifications constitutes Your acceptance of such modifications and Your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, Your sole remedy is to discontinue Your use of the Product. The most current version of these Terms and Conditions will be available on the NETGEAR website and supersedes previous versions.

##### 5.    SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES

5.1    Subscriptions. NETGEAR offers certain products and services on a subscription basis (“**Subscription Services**” or “**Services**”).  
          
    (a)    Your subscription period is stated in Your subscription plan, and Your subscription fee will cover the Services and content covered in Your subscription plan.  
          
    (b)    Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.  
          
    (c)    As part of Your Subscription Services, NETGEAR may offer additional content for purchase (“**Purchased** **Content**”). Except as required by law, all transactions for Purchased Content are final, and NETGEAR does not accept returns. You may cancel an order for Purchased Content within 24 hours of purchase or rental (or, for customers in the European Union, within 14 days from the date of purchase), except You may not cancel an order for Purchased Content once You have downloaded it.

##### 6.    PAYMENT AND AUTOMATIC RENEWAL

6.1    Payment. You agree that You will pay for the Subscription Services and other Purchased Content You purchase from NETGEAR, and that NETGEAR (or its third party payment processor) may charge Your credit card or other payment processing account (as chosen by You) for those Services and Purchased Content.  
  
    (a)    You further acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, subscription preferences that You select, changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and You authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.  
  
    (b)    YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING NETGEAR WITH A VALID CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT PROCESSING ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES.  
  
6.2    Billing Account and Payment Method. You will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for a Service. You can access and change Your billing information and payment method by emailing **[customer.service@netgear.com](mailto:customer.service@netgear.com) .** Additionally, You agree to permit NETGEAR to use any updated account information regarding Your selected payment method provided by Your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. If You want to designate a different payment processing account or if there is a change in Your credit card other payment processing account status, You must change Your information online or by contacting customer support, which may temporarily disrupt Your access to the Services while NETGEAR verifies Your new payment information.  
  
6.3    Recurring Payments. When You purchase the Subscription Services on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually), **You agree that You are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to NETGEAR by the method and at the recurring intervals You have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by You or by NETGEAR**. By authorizing recurring payments, You are authorizing NETGEAR to store Your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from Your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to Your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, “Electronic Payments”). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.  
  
6.4     **Automatic Renewal and Trials . If Your account is set to automatically renew or is in a trial period, YOU AGREE THAT NETGEAR MAY CHARGE YOU AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS YOU NOTIFY NETGEAR IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL. NETGEAR may revise subscription service rates by providing You at least thirty days’ notice prior to the next charge.**  
  
6.5     **Automatic Renewal Sign-Up.** To sign up for Subscription Services with recurring payments, You must complete the required registration details, and agree that Your subscription may automatically renew for the same applicable term until You cancel:  
  
    (a)    You will receive an e-mail confirmation of Your auto-renewal once You complete the initial payment process.  
          
    (b)    You agree that NETGEAR may automatically charge the subscription fee to the credit or charge card provided and associated with Your account at the beginning of each period at the frequency You have selected unless and until You cancel the subscription option.  
          
    (c)    You must cancel prior to the subscription fee being charged to the credit or charge card. If You signed up at a promotional rate any renewals past the promotional period will be charged at the then effective subscription fee. Access to Your Services will not be established until NETGEAR or its agent has verified that the credit card information is valid, accurate and that Your credit card account is in good standing.  
          
    (d)    You will receive an e-mail reminder of Your auto-renewal thirty (30) days prior to any applicable renewal. You will also receive a reminder email a day before Your date of renewal reminding You that Your subscription option will be renewed for an additional period.  
  
6.6    Late Payments. NETGEAR may suspend or terminate Your Services without notice upon rejection of any credit card charges or if Your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks the return of payments previously made to NETGEAR for the Subscription Services. You agree NETGEAR may charge interest on all amounts due that remain unpaid for thirty (30) days or more. The monthly interest will equal up to one point five percent (1.5%) of the past due amount or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, until the past due amount and interest is paid. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to NETGEAR. NETGEAR may refer Your account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default.  
      
6.7    Hardware Equipment. If Your Subscription Service includes hardware equipment, you will be charged a non-refundable shipping cost for NETGEAR to ship the equipment to you.  
  
6.8    Reactivation. If for any reason You need to reactivate a terminated Subscription Service, You may be charged a reactivation fee

##### 7.    CANCELLATION POLICY AND PROCEDURE

7.1    Cancellation of Your Subscription Services by You.  
  
    (a)    Cancellation Procedure. You may request termination of Your account and use of the Subscription Services at any time by communicating such request to NETGEAR by emailing **[customer.service@netgear.com](mailto:customer.service@netgear.com) .**  
  
    (b)    Refund Policy. Unless otherwise specified in the Additional Terms applicable to Your Products or Services, the following will apply:  
              
            **Free Trial Period**. If You are taking part in any trial-period offer, You must cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring new charges. If You do not cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period, NETGEAR will charge you for the Service(s).  
              
            **Fixed-Term Subscription (paid monthly)**. If You cancel by the end of the trial period, You will not incur any new charges. If You cancel after the trial period, Your Service will continue until the end of that month’s billing period, and You will be charged an early termination fee equal to your monthly subscription rate for each month remaining on your subscription.  
              
            **Fixed-Term Subscription (prepaid).** If You cancel by the end of the trial period, You will not incur any new charges. If You cancel after the trial period, Your payment is non-refundable and Your service will continue until the end of Your contracted term.  
              
            **Month-to-month Subscription**. If You cancel by the end of the trial period, You will not incur any new charges. If You cancel after the trial period, Your payment is non-refundable and Your service will continue until the end of that month’s billing period.  
              
            **Shipping Charges**. Any shipping charges paid in connection with your Service(s) are non-refundable.  
  
7.2    Termination of Your Subscription Services by NETGEAR.  
  
    (a)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, NETGEAR retains the absolute right to immediately disable and/or terminate Your Service at any time (without observing any notice period) if:  
          
            You are in breach of any provision of these Subscription Terms;  
          
            You have demonstrated (regardless of whether directly or through Your actions or statements or otherwise) that You do not intend to comply with these Subscription Terms or NETGEAR’s Terms and Conditions;  
          
            Your subscription charges are refused for any reason;  
              
            You misuse the Services;  
              
            You alter Your system or use the Services or software in such a manner as to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of NETGEAR or any third party;  
              
            Any supplier or partner of NETGEAR providing the Services to or together with NETGEAR decide to terminate the provision of the Services or any parts thereof (either worldwide or in the country where You are a resident or from where You are Using the Services) or if any supplier or partner of NETGEAR decides to terminate the entire relationship with NETGEAR and regardless of the reason of such termination, including where any supplier or partner of NETGEAR are of the opinion that the provision of the Services or parts thereof to You or to NETGEAR or together with NETGEAR are no longer commercially feasible;

23.1    **To the extent possible under governing law, (other than a limited hardware or other warranty specifically provided by NETGEAR) the Products (including any documents or material, software and firmware updates downloaded, installed or otherwise obtained through the use of the Products) are provided by NETGEAR on an “as is” and “as available” basis and Your use of the Product is at Your own risk.** NETGEAR is not responsible for any damage to Your mobile phone or mobile phone’s software, computer system or other device or device’s software or any loss of data that is caused by or results from the download and/or use of any such documents and/or material.  
  
23.2    **To the extent allowed under applicable law, NETGEAR and its suppliers disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Products, including any implied warranty of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement of third party rights.** NETGEAR hereby further expressly disclaims all liability for any claims for Product failures that are due to normal Product wear, Product misuse, abuse, Product modification, improper Product selection or Your non-compliance with any and all applicable Federal, state, or local laws. This warranty and warranty disclaimer give You specific legal rights, and You may have other rights that vary by state, province, or country. Other than as permitted by law, NETGEAR does not exclude, limit or suspend other rights You have, including those that may arise from the nonconformity of a sales contract. For a full understanding of Your rights You should consult the laws of Your state, province, or country. \[For Australian customers: Please note that this warranty is in addition to any statutory rights in Australia in relation to Your goods which, pursuant to the Australian consumer law, cannot be excluded.\]

**NETGEAR makes no warranty that the Product will meet Your requirements or that use of the Product will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free; nor does NETGEAR make any warranty as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the Product (including third party content), that any defects in the Product will be corrected or that the Product will be compatible with any other specific hardware or Product.** Further, NETGEAR does not warrant that the Product or the NETGEAR servers that provide You with data and content are free of viruses or other harmful components; NETGEAR also assumes no responsibility for and shall not be liable for any damages caused by viruses that may infect Your computer software or other hardware.  
  
23.3    You agree that NETGEAR is not an insurer and that NETGEAR is not providing You with insurance of any type. Any amounts that You pay NETGEAR for the Product are not insurance premiums and are not related to the value of Your property, anyone else’s property located in Your premises, or any risk of loss at Your premises. If You want insurance to protect against any risk of loss at Your premises, You will purchase it. In the event of any loss, damage or injury, You will not look to NETGEAR to compensate You or anyone else. You release and waive for Yourself and Your insurer all subrogation and other rights to recover against NETGEAR arising as a result of the payment of any claim for loss, damage or injury.  
  
23.4    NETGEAR’s devices and services do not cause and cannot eliminate occurrences of certain events, including but not limited to, fires, floods, burglaries, robberies and medical problems. NETGEAR makes no guaranty or warranty, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, that the devices and services provided will detect or avert such incidents or their consequences. NETGEAR does not undertake any risk that You or Your property, or the person or property of others, may be subject to injury or loss if such an event occurs.

NETGEAR is not responsible for loss, recovery, or compromise of data, software or programs, or loss of use of Your product or other equipment arising out of the service. In addition, NETGEAR provides no remedies for any loss of data resulting from use of the service.

23.6    When You subscribe to NETGEAR’s extended warranty and support services, NETGEAR will use reasonable effort to resolve Your problem. However, the complexity of technology will inevitably result in NETGEAR being unable to resolve certain customer problems. You acknowledge that You are aware of this limitation. NETGEAR does not guarantee problem resolution to every customer problem. NETGEAR will only exercise reasonable effort to resolve Your technical problem. You further agree that due to the rapidly changing nature of technology, NETGEAR cannot be held responsible for supporting every computer-related product in the market. NETGEAR will attempt to indicate which products or product lines are supported on its web site. NETGEAR may, at its own sole discretion, decide to provide technical support for a product not listed on the web site. In this case, NETGEAR warrants support only for the specific problem instance and does not warrant that it will continue to support such unlisted product beyond that instance. \[For our Australian customers: NETGEAR extended warranty and support services are in addition to any statutory rights in Australia in relation to your goods which, pursuant to the Australian consumer law, cannot be excluded.\]

IF WE CANNOT LAWFULLY DISCLAIM STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THEN TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE DURATION OF THIS EXPRESS LIMITED DEVICE WARRANTY OR REFURBISHED PRODUCT WARRANTY AND TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT SERVICE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG A STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  
  
24.7    Playback Quality; Streaming . The playback resolution and quality of any Purchased Content will depend on a number of factors, including the type of device on which You are accessing the Purchased Content and Your bandwidth, which may increase or decrease during use. If NETGEAR detects that any Purchased Content it is streaming may be interrupted or may otherwise not play properly due to bandwidth constraints or other factors, NETGEAR may decrease the resolution or file size of the streamed Purchased Content in an effort to provide an uninterrupted experience. NETGEAR does not guarantee the resolution or quality of the Purchased Content You will receive while streaming.
