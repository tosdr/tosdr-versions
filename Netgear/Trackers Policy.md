Ad and Cookie Privacy
=====================

##### We use common tracking technologies.

We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website, app or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. To do this, we use several common tracking tools. Our vendors may also use these tools. These may include browser cookies. We may also use web beacons and similar technologies.

##### We use tracking technologies for a variety of reasons.

We use tracking tools, including cookies, on our websites. A cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer's hard drive. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. Many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies as you prefer. The Help portion of your web browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. To learn more, visit [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) or [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). These pages also explain how you can manage and delete cookies. We use tracking tools:

* To provide information that will allow or improve the functionality of the various NETGEAR, Arlo and VueZone applications and services.
* To recognize new or past customers.
* To store your password if you are registered on our sites.
* To better understand the interests of our customers and our website visitors. To help our business partners or other websites engage in these activities.
* To gather statistics on how our websites are used.
* To improve the NETGEAR websites by measuring any errors that occur.
* To allow us to test different designs of our websites.

##### We use specific tracking technologies.

NETGEAR websites use NETGEAR and third-party "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. We use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of NETGEAR and Arlo websites and services that depend on cookies.

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to NETGEAR websites. We may also use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our websites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.  This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.  In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

##### We engage in interest-based advertising.

We and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include apps.

Interest-based advertising or “online behavioral advertising” includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities. These ads might be served on websites or on apps. They might also be served in emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other companies’ products.

##### How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based advertising?

To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. 

We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it might include online usage information.

##### You can control tracking tools.

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To find out more about how to enable, disable, or delete cookies from your web browser, please visit [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [here](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/security.html). To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

**Our Do Not Track Policy: Some websites have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals**. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work. If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop. 

Options you select are browser and device specific.

##### You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising.

The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, click [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
