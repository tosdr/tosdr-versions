At NETGEAR, we only share your Personal Information when we have legitimate business reasons for doing so.

We share these categories of Personal Information for our business purposes (listed in Section 5 above, titled "How We Use Your Personal Information") in the following ways, or as otherwise disclosed to you at the time of data collection:

**e. We may share information for legal reasons**. We will share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of NETGEAR if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

* meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;

* detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;

**Disclosures for California Residents**

* Disclosure About Direct Marketing. California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits California residents to annually request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to other entities for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.

Relatedly, we do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share Personal Information of California consumers under 16 years of age. However, we may share your Personal Information with our affiliates and trusted partners in arrangements that may meet the broad definition of “sale” or “share” under California law. In these arrangements, use of the information we share is limited by policies, contracts, or similar restrictions.
* Disclosure about Financial Incentives. From time to time, we may offer financial incentives, such as coupons, discounts or other price reductions, for our products and services in exchange for your enrolment in email updates, newsletter delivery, contests, or similar communications.

#### **9\. Data Transfers**

NETGEAR is a global business. Accordingly, we may transfer your Personal Information to recipients in countries other than your country, including the United States, where we are headquartered. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed to you at the time of data collection. By using our Sites, Products, and Services or providing any Personal Information, where applicable law permits, you agree to the transfers, processing, and storage of your Personal Information outside of your country of residence.

If you are located in the European Economic Area, ("EEA"), we comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate safeguards for the transfer of Personal Information to countries other than the country where you are located. In particular, we use contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information to third parties, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.

In addition, NETGEAR has self-certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. For more information, see our Data Privacy Framework Notice below.

#### **10\. Data Privacy Framework Notice**

NETGEAR complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("EU-U.S. DPF"), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("Swiss-U.S. DPF") as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. NETGEAR has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles ("EU-U.S. DPF Principles") with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, from the United Kingdom in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. NETGEAR has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.

•    The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over NETGEAR’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this NETGEAR privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

•    We may employ third party service provider companies and individuals to provide, improve, and protect the Sites, Products and Services on our behalf. We maintain contracts with service providers that restrict their access, use, and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our DPF obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and we may be liable if they fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to damage.

•    Individuals with questions or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first submit inquiries via e-mail to [privacypolicy@netgear.com](mailto:privacypolicy@netgear.com). In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, NETGEAR has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to NETGEAR’s independent dispute resolution body, JAMS, to assist with the complaint resolution process. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework) for more information and to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.

Under limited circumstances, more fully described on the DPF website (available [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf)), binding arbitration may be a dispute resolution mechanism if your complaint is not resolved through these channels. The International Centre for Dispute Resolution-American Arbitration Association (“ICDR-AAA”) was selected by the U.S. Department of Commerce to administer arbitrations pursuant to and manage the arbitral fund. Please visit ICDR-AAA’s [website](http://go.adr.org/privacyshieldfund.html) for more information.

#### **14\. Children’s Privacy**

Our Products and Services are meant for adults. We do not knowingly allow children under 16 to set up NETGEAR or Meural accounts. If you are under 16, do not use the Sites or Services. If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe that we may have collected Personal Information from someone under 16, please let us know using the methods described in the Contact Us section and we will take appropriate measures to investigate and address the issue promptly.

#### **15\. How We Protect Your Personal Information**

We intend to protect the Personal Information entrusted to us and treat it securely in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession. We also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not sharing it with anyone. We also encourage you to use caution when using the Internet as it is not 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted electronically and we cannot promise that your use of our Sites and Services will be completely safe. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are also not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites.

If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a NETGEAR website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither NETGEAR nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. NETGEAR is not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

#### **16\. Retention of Personal Information**

We retain your Personal Information for a period that is reasonably necessary in order that we can achieve the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected, including to provide you the Services requested and to support our business purposes as listed above. As a result, different retention periods apply to different types of information.

We also take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it or when you request its deletion, unless we are allowed or required by law to keep the information for a longer period. We complete periodic reviews of our databases, and have established time limits for certain data deletion, taking into account the type of services provided in the context of the Products and Services, the length of our relationship with you, mandatory retention periods, and the statute of limitations.

#### **17\. Third Party Services**

Our Services may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to a website(s) we do not control. These links are provided for your information and convenience only and are not an endorsement of the content of such linked websites or third parties. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services may be provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through us. This Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of that website. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of such website carefully. We are not responsible for third party sites or services to which links or access are provided through our Services, nor are we responsible for their content or availability.

#### **18\. Updates to this Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date. We recommend that you visit these pages periodically to be aware of and review any such revisions. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice on our Sites or sending you a notification.
