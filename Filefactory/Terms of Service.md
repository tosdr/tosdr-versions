If such traffic results in an Action (as defined below), Affiliates may be paid a commission ("Commission"), which may be calculated as a fixed fee, a percentage fee, a bonus or other payment depending upon a pre-selected program type (e.g., revenue share, pay per order or pay per member) (the "Program Type") and in accordance with certain rules ("Program Rules").

You represent and warrant that (a) you have the authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement, (b) you are a business and not a consumer, and (c) if you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or entity, (i) you have the authority to bind such company or entity, and (ii) such company or entity has authorized you to accept this Agreement on its behalf.

#### 3\. LIMITED LICENSE TO USE ADVERTISING ASSETS.

Affiliate represents and warrants that it submits or contributes content to or owns and/or operates the Affiliate Site and desires to place Advertising Assets on the Affiliate Site subject to the terms of this Agreement. FileFactory makes Advertising Assets available to promote the services of FileFactory. Such Advertising Assets may contain logos, trademarks, service marks and/or identifying words for FileFactory products and services ("FileFactory Services"). You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to display these Advertising Assets throughout the Affiliate Site, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and FileFactory's policies and procedures. You may not alter, change, add to, or otherwise modify any Advertising Asset provided by us. This Agreement does not authorize the use of any Advertising Assets for any off-line or non-Internet (i.e., print) advertising or in the use of email marketing or other similar solicitations.

#### 4\. AFFILIATE'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR AFFILIATE SITE AND CONTENT.

You will be solely responsible and liable for the development, operation, maintenance and all materials, content and Special Links that appears on the Affiliate Site. You shall operate and maintain the Affiliate Site in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We reserve the right to monitor the Affiliate Site to determine if you are in compliance with this Agreement.

#### 5\. MULTIPLE REFERRAL PROGRAM TYPES; MINIMUM THRESHOLD.

As an Affiliate, you may participate in multiple Program Types and be subject to one or more Commission rate schedules ("Schedules"). A current list of Program Types and Schedules are posted on FileFactory. Your participation in a specific Program Type may require you to meet minimum thresholds based upon various factors including, but not limited to, the duration, fees paid, conversion ratio, etc. Commissions may be modified for, or excluded from, certain trial, promotional and similar offers. The prices charged to customers by FileFactory are subject to change at any time. You may not include price information on the Affiliate Site related to any product or service provided by FileFactory. We will use reasonable efforts to present accurate information, but we cannot guarantee the availability or price of any particular product or service that we offer.

#### 6\. COMMISSION TRACKING AND REPORTING.

FileFactory uses commercially accepted methods and practices, which may include session or other types of cookies, to track a person's activities while on FileFactory. (To learn more about cookies, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP\_cookie.) Such methods and practices are designed to determine when an Action occurs. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Program Rules for the Program Type, in order for a Commission to be earned, a person referred from the Affiliate Site to FileFactory must be tracked by FileFactory from the time the Special Link to FileFactory is activated (i.e., "clicked") until the person completes the member registration process and creates an account with FileFactory. We will not be liable to you or any other person for any Commissions or other amounts if we are unable to determine that an Action has occurred, whether due to a visitor's or member's browser settings, lack of AID, App bugs, antivirus software or otherwise. For purposes of illustration only, when cookies are used, the cookies are generally set to expire when a person using FileFactory terminates his or her browser session. If the cookie session expires before the creation of an account on FileFactory, you will not earn and will not be entitled to receive a Commission based upon any subsequent Actions taken by such person. For purposes of illustration only, if (a) a visitor is directed and comes to FileFactory from a Special Link on Site A, but does not complete the member registration process and create an account and then later returns to FileFactory from a Special Link from Site B and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A; or (b) if a visitor is directed and comes to FileFactory from Site A, but does not complete the membership registration process and create an account and later returns to FileFactory and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A.

FileFactory takes commercially reasonable steps to provide you with online access to track and review (a) Actions resulting in Commissions taken by members directed to FileFactory by the Affiliate Site, (b) Commissions accrued, and (c) certain other information using FileFactory's online reporting tools on a password-protected webpage (the "Reports Page"). The Reports Page is usually updated on a daily basis but is not in "real-time" and is subject to final reconciliation, taking into consideration non-completed transactions, Chargebacks, Credits and other potential charges. The form, content and frequency of the Reports Page remain subject to change.

#### 7\. NO COMMISSION PAID.

Not all paid products or services appearing on FileFactory entitle you to a Commission. FileFactory may refuse to permit any person to establish an Account for any reason and may reject any Action that does not meet FileFactory's requirements or policies and procedures in effect from time to time. For purposes of illustration only, FileFactory may reject an order for goods or services based upon a credit card with insufficient funds. You shall not earn or be entitled to receive any Commission (a) attributable to any revenue collected by us arising out of any tax, royalty and/or duty that we, or those acting on our behalf, collect from any person using FileFactory, (b) paid by us for any SMS, merchant processing or similar fees or (c) results in Chargebacks or Credits.

#### 8\. PAYMENT; COMMISSION PAYMENT FLOOR AND SETOFF.

FileFactory's current policy is to issue any Commission payments earned and owing in accordance with the Program Rules for the Program Type within approximately thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar month when the Commission was earned. All Commissions are payable in USD. To the extent we receive non-USD currency for Actions, such currency will be converted into USD in accordance with FileFactory's exchange rate policies and procedures.

In order to qualify for payment, Affiliate must be actively participating in the Program. An active Affiliate is defined as having generated at least 100 unique completed downloads from your Account during the preceding 30 days, and uploaded a new unique file to your Account on at least 15 of the preceding 30 days.

If the amount accrued to you for any payment of Commissions is less than the minimum amount established by us (the "Commission Payment Floor"), we will hold such payment until the payment period after the total amount accrued is at least equal to the Commission Payment Floor. The Commission Payment Floor is currently 100.00USD and subject to change at any time or from time to time in our sole discretion. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change in the Commission Payment Floor via email, posting a revised version of this Agreement, posting on FileFactory, or via other methods. If you have not earned or accrued referral fees in at least the amount of the Commission Payment Floor in the six (6) months prior to any given monthly payment period, or if your Account is suspended as provided herein, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion without notice to you, and without waiver by us, to charge you an Account maintenance fee in an amount up to 50.00USD per six (6) month period. The account maintenance fee charged may be deducted and offset against any unpaid Commissions.

If a Commission is paid or owed and a subsequent Chargeback or Credit occurs, FileFactory may, in addition to any other remedies, terminate this Agreement for cause and/or setoff the amount of the Chargeback or Credit and any related fees from any subsequent payments owing to you. If there is no subsequent payment due, FileFactory will send you an invoice for the amount of the setoff amount, and you agree to pay such invoice no later than thirty (30) days following receipt.

#### 9\. ORDER PROCESSING; OWNERSHIP OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION.

FileFactory and its service providers are solely responsible for processing and fulfilling all orders for FileFactory customers, including but not limited to, order entry, payment processing, shipping, cancellations, creditbacks, returns and related customer service.

#### 10\. NON-EXCLUSIVE LIMITED LICENSE TO USE FILEFACTORY MARKS.

FileFactory grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited license to use the logos, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and similar identifying material specified by such FileFactory solely for the purpose of advertising the FileFactory Services through the use of Advertising Assets in accordance with Section 3, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree:

1. to refrain from purchasing, bidding on, or otherwise obtaining or using keywords incorporating or otherwise based upon the FileFactory Marks on search engines (e.g., google.com, yahoo.com and bing.com) and to further refrain from violating any applicable App store's terms of use or licensing agreements;
2. to not use or place the FileFactory Marks on or with any items or web pages or Apps that are injurious to end-users or their property, including but not limited to, items that could give rise to a claim for a breach of an express or implied warranty or product liability, or which is scandalous, libellous, obscene, violate intellectual property rights, or constitute an invasion of privacy or unauthorized use of likeness or otherwise unlawful or tortious;
3. to use the FileFactory Marks exactly in the form provided and in conformance with any trademark usage policies, guidelines and quality standards of FileFactory and not to alter, modify or change the FileFactory Marks in any way;
4. to furnish, upon request, at no charge to FileFactory, a representative specimen of your use of the FileFactory Marks;(e) if, at any time, your use of the FileFactory Marks fails to conform to FileFactory’s trademark usage policies, guidelines or quality standards, to promptly remove the FileFactory Marks from the Affiliate Site;
5. not to take any Action inconsistent with FileFactory's ownership of the FileFactory Marks;
6. not to use the FileFactory Marks in any manner that is disparaging or that otherwise portrays FileFactory in a negative or misleading light;
7. not to create an App, website or web page that uses the FileFactory Marks in a manner that is likely to be confused (e.g., similar designs, graphics, look and feel) with one or more websites or App(s) operated by FileFactory;
8. not to use, register or file an application to register a trademark, service mark, domain name, user name, account name or other proprietary designation incorporating the FileFactory Marks, or any variation of the FileFactory Marks, whether they are used alone, in part, or in combination with other words or are based upon typographical errors or misspellings ("Prohibited Designation"); and
9. to notify FileFactory promptly upon becoming aware of any improper use of the FileFactory Marks and reasonably cooperate with FileFactory (at FileFactory's request) in the protection of the FileFactory Marks.

You may only use the FileFactory Marks to the extent that you advertise FileFactory Services pursuant to this Agreement. We reserve all intellectual property and proprietary rights in and to the FileFactory Marks, and any and all goodwill generated by your use of the FileFactory Marks shall inure solely to the benefit of FileFactory. You recognize the great value of the goodwill associated with the FileFactory Marks, and you acknowledge and agree that the FileFactory Marks and all rights therein and goodwill pertaining thereto are valid and belong exclusively to FileFactory, and that FileFactory has the exclusive right to use and authorize others to use the FileFactory Marks.

The license granted to you pursuant to this Section may be revoked at any time for any reason and shall terminate upon expiration or termination of this Agreement.

#### 11\. NON-EXCLUSIVE LIMITED LICENSE TO USE YOUR MARKS.

You hereby grant FileFactory a non-exclusive, transferable, world-wide license to utilize your name(s), titles, logos, and trademarks ("Your Marks") to advertise, market, promote and publicize in any manner the FileFactory Services, the FileFactory Site and our rights hereunder. However, we shall have no obligation to so advertise, market, promote or publicize. You hereby represent and warrant that you are the sole and exclusive owner of Your Marks and/or have all necessary rights and power to grant to us the license to use Your Marks in the manner contemplated herein, and such grant does and will not (a) breach, conflict with, or constitute a default under any agreement or other instrument applicable to you or binding upon you, or (b) infringe upon any trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, or other proprietary right of any other person or entity. This license shall terminate immediately following the effective date of termination of this Agreement.

#### 12\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
