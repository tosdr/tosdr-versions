Effective Date: January 1, 2023 ([(view previous version)](https://fivestars.com/legal/previous/))

SumUp, Inc. f/k/a Five Stars Loyalty, Inc. (“Fivestars,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”) provides users with the ability to make credit and debit card purchases and earn points and rewards (collectively, “Rewards”) from various participating merchants, and/or directly from Fivestars as the case may be, through its point of sale terminal (“Terminal”), website, [https://fivestars.com](https://fivestars.com/) (the “Site”), and mobile and other software applications as available (collectively, the “Service(s)”) subject to the following Terms (as amended from time to time, the “Terms”) and the Privacy Policy located at [https://fivestars.com/privacy](https://fivestars.com/privacy/). The terms “user,” “you,” and “your” mean any user of the Service(s).

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify these Terms at any time without further notice. If we change these Terms in a material way, we will provide appropriate notice to you, and, for any change, will indicate the date of revision at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms, please stop using and accessing the Service.

**These Terms contain a mandatory arbitration provision that requires that disputes be resolved in individual arbitration or small claims court proceedings. Please read these Terms carefully.**

**The Service**

**Your Registration Obligations:** You are required to register with Fivestars to access and use certain features of the Service, including the Rewards. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. The Service is limited to legal residents in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Service, with or without registering, and must stop use of the Service immediately. If you are between 14 and 18 years old, you may use the Service, with or without registering, only with the approval of your parent or guardian. You further agree that you will not provide us or Rewards Providers any mobile device numbers not assigned to you. You agree that your use of the Service will comply with applicable law and that you will not use the Service to engage in any illegal activity.  
**Payment Authorization:** You agree and represent to Fivestars that you are an authorized user of any credit or debit card or payment instrument (collectively “payment instrument”) you use in connection with the Service. Your use of a payment instrument is subject to the terms and conditions set forth by the entities that issue your payment instrument. You are responsible for complying with those terms and conditions.

**Your Privacy**

At Fivestars, we respect the privacy of our users. For details please see our [Privacy Policy](https://fivestars.com/privacy/). By using the Service, you consent to our collection and use of personal data as outlined therein.

**Member Account, Password and Security**: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Fivestars of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you log out of your account at the end of each session. Fivestars will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these requirements. Only one account is permitted per person. You agree and represent that you are not currently and will not use or maintain any other Fivestars account under a different phone number. Your account and your rights under this agreement cannot be transferred by you to any party.

**Modifications to Service**: Fivestars reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Fivestars shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

**Rewards**: By using the Service, you may have the opportunity to qualify for Rewards through promotional campaigns offered by merchants that participate in the Service. All Rewards made available in connection with the Service are promotional only and have no cash value. You have no property value in any Rewards. Such Rewards are made available directly by the relevant merchant providing such Reward (“Rewards Provider”), and not Fivestars, and are redeemable solely for the applicable goods or services of the relevant Rewards Provider as may be determined by such Rewards Provider. The Rewards Provider, not Fivestars, is the provider of the Rewards and such goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Rewards you obtain. Fivestars will have no liability if a Rewards Provider refuses or fails to honor any Reward. In addition, the following terms and conditions also apply to all Rewards:

* Rewards may not be cashed out or transferred into any other medium of exchange.
* Rewards are nontransferable.
* Redemption frequency is determined by the Rewards Provider.
* Use of Rewards relating to alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Rewards Provider and is subject to compliance with applicable law.
* Rewards cannot be combined with any other rewards, offers, vouchers, third-party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by the Rewards Provider.
* Neither Fivestars nor the Rewards Provider is responsible for malfunctioning, lost, or stolen cards.
* Reproduction or sale of any Reward is prohibited.
* Any attempted redemption not consistent with these Terms or any other restrictions imposed by the Rewards Provider or Fivestars (including any Reward-specific terms associated with a Reward) will render the Reward void.
* Rewards are void to the extent prohibited by law.
* Rewards may be applied only to the applicable products or services sold by the Rewards Provider that are the subject of such Rewards as determined by such Rewards Provider.

A Rewards Provider may discontinue its rewards program and participation with Fivestars’ Service at any time. Fivestars also reserves the right to terminate a Rewards Provider’s rewards program and participation with the Service at any time. Upon termination of a Rewards Program for whatever reason, all Rewards will become null and void and will not be redeemable for any good, service, or any other value, financial or otherwise.

**Third-Party Services**: You may register for the Service using third-party services (e.g., Facebook Login) and otherwise enable various third-party services to be directly integrated into your Fivestars experience. By enabling third-party services within the Service, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information or other information (e.g., token authentication information) to these services for this purpose. Please remember that the manner in which third-party services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and Fivestars shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third-party site or service. When you access a third-party service you will be subject to the privacy policy of the third-party service. In addition, Fivestars is not responsible for the accuracy, availability or reliability of any information, content, goods, data, opinions, advice or statements made available in connection with third-party services, and such third-party services may revoke authentication or become unavailable at any time. As such, Fivestars is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such third-party service. Fivestars enables these features merely as a convenience and the inclusion of such features does not imply an endorsement or recommendation.

**Mobile Services**: The Service includes certain services that are available via a mobile device, including the ability to upload content to the Service and the ability to browse and otherwise access the Service or certain features thereof (“Mobile Services”). To the extent you access the Service through a mobile device, message & data rates may apply. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we and Rewards Providers may communicate with you by automated SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to your mobile device and that information about your usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your Fivestars account information.

**Third Party Applications**

The Service may be available or accessed in connection with Fivestars applications (“Applications”) made available through third party providers such as Apple, Inc., or Google, Inc. (“Provider”) through their storefronts such as the App Store and Google Play.

* Fivestars and you acknowledge that these Terms are between Fivestars and you only, and not with any Provider, and that as between Fivestars and any Provider, Fivestars, not the Provider, is solely responsible for the Applications and the content thereof.
* You may not use the Applications in any manner that is in violation of or inconsistent with the usage rules set forth for Applications made available through a Provider, or otherwise be in conflict with the terms of use of the Provider.
* Your license to use Applications is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Applications on a device that you own or control, as permitted by the usage rules set forth in the terms of use of the Provider.
* Provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to the Applications.
* Provider is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law. In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Provider, and Provider will refund the purchase price for the Application to you, if any; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Applications, or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, which will be Fivestars’ sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable law.
* Fivestars and you acknowledge that Fivestars, not Provider, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Applications or your possession and/or use of those Applications, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Applications fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar law.
* In the event of any third party claim that the Applications or the end-user’s possession and use of those Applications infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Fivestars and Provider, Fivestars, not Provider, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.
* You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s Specially Designated Nationals List; and (iii) you will comply with U.S. export control laws in connection with your use of the Service.
* If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Applications, they should be directed to Fivestars as follows:  
    [support@Fivestars.com](mailto:support@Fivestars.com)  
    Five Stars Loyalty, Inc.  
    500 3rd St #405,  
    San Francisco, CA 94107  
    860-578-2770

Fivestars and you acknowledge and agree that Provider, and Provider’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms with respect to the Applications made available through Provider, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you with respect to the Applications as a third party beneficiary thereof.

**Third Party Websites**

The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links or other access to other sites and resources on the Internet (including Rewards Provider websites). Fivestars has no control over such sites and resources, and Fivestars is not responsible for and does not endorse such sites and resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Fivestars shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, events, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource. Any dealings you have with third parties (including Rewards Providers) while using the Service are between you and the third party, and you agree that Fivestars is not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against any such third party.  
Indemnity and Release

You agree to release, indemnify and hold Fivestars and its affiliates and their officers, employees, directors and agents harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, any User Content, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms of Service or your violation of any rights of another. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

**Disclaimer of Warranties**

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. FIVESTARS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  
FIVESTARS MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (III) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, OR (IV) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

**Limitation of Liability**

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT FIVESTARS, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF FIVESTARS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED, MESSAGES RECEIVED, OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE; OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICE. IN NO EVENT SHALL FIVESTARS’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FIVESTARS IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS LESS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.  
Arbitration and Class Waiver

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Service, other than a court action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, (“Covered Disputes”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would.

The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules, including the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards. JAMS’s rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.

This arbitration and class waiver agreement not only applies to Covered Disputes between you and Fivestars, but also to Covered Disputes between you and Reward Providers, other merchants who participate in Fivestars loyalty programs, or vendors who perform services for Fivestars.

**Choice of Law**

Except as provided above in the Arbitration and Class Waiver section, these Terms will be governed by the laws of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement and does not create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise.  
Termination

You agree that Fivestars, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Fivestars believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service and may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Fivestars may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Fivestars may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all of your related Rewards. Further, you agree that Fivestars shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.

**User Disputes**

You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user, Rewards Provider or third party in connection with the Service (or any third-party service with which the Service is integrated), and Fivestars will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Fivestars reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any Rewards Provider or other third party in connection with the Service (or any third-party service with which the Service is integrated). In addition, without limiting the foregoing, Fivestars will have no liability or responsibility for any acts or omissions of Rewards Providers with respect to their use of any of your information or your interactions with them.

**General**

These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Fivestars and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Fivestars with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. The failure of Fivestars to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and Fivestars nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to Fivestars’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
