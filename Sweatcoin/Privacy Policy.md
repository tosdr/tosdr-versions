Privacy Policy
--------------

_This Privacy Policy was last updated on 2 March 2023_

SweatCo Ltd is a company incorporated in England (registration number 9242159) whose registered office is c/o OHS Secretaries Limited, 9th Floor, 107 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6DN (hereafter referred to as “SweatCo”, “we” or “us” as the context may require).  SweatCo is registered as a Data Controller with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (registration number ZA182331). 

This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Sweatcoin mobile application (the “Sweatcoin App”) which hosts the Sweatcoin Marketplace (“**Marketplace**”) and uses the sweatcoin reward point (“**Sweatcoin(s)**”), any website operated by SweatCo (including http://sweatco.in) (the “SweatCo Website(s)”) and the services we provide that are accessible via any of them (the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be stored and processed by us. 

MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENT

Please note that you must be aged 13 years or older to use the Services. Please do not use the Services or provide us with any personal information if you are under 13 years of age. 

INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU

From time to time, we may collect or ask you to provide personal information including (without limitation) the following: your name, mobile phone number, email address, password, identification credentials, your contacts, biographical details, photographs and/or payment information.  

We also automatically collect, store and use information about your use of the Services, and about your computer, tablet, mobile or other device through which you access the Services. This includes the following information:

* Technical Data: including the Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider, device identifiers, your login information, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, preferred language, activities, operating system and platform, and geographical location; and

* Usage Data: including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from the SweatCo Websites, pages you viewed and searched for, page response times, length of visits to certain pages, referral source/exit pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks and mouse-overs), date and time pages are accessed, website navigation and search terms used, and whether you have opened our marketing newsletters.

We may also automatically record the purchases you have made through the Sweatcoin App or SweatCo Websites using Sweatcoin (“**Transaction Data**”) to obtain an understanding of your preferences so that we can provide you with more tailored marketing where appropriate. 

As part of the Services, we may provide functionality allowing you to search for friends by using your Facebook credentials and, when you elect to do this, you will be asked to allow the Sweatcoin App to access certain information associated with your Facebook account such as your name, profile picture, gender and list of friends.  Provided you consent to this, such information will be processed by us in order to identify your Facebook friends who are users of Sweatcoin App and to allow you to invite those Facebook friends to install the Sweatcoin App. 

Please note that, with your consent, we will collect information about your location and physical movements in order for the Sweatcoin App to function properly and monitor and verify forms of eligible movement.  You may turn location monitoring on and off from time to time using the settings of your operating system of your mobile device but, if you disable this functionality, we will not be able to collect information relating to your step-count and GPS/Cell-ID location which will prevent tracking and/or conversion of your movement into Sweatcoins.

We work with third parties from time to time (including, for example, Apple HealthKit, Near Foundation, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers and search information providers  who may provide to us information about you. This may include your purchase history from business partners who supply you with rewards made available via the Sweatcoin App.

USES MADE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

As a data controller, we will only use your personal data if we have a legal basis for doing so. The table at Annex 1 sets out the purposes for which we use your personal data as well as the relevant legal bases on which we do so.

WHO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH

We may share your personal data with the following recipients as necessary to achieve the purposes set out in Annex 1 or as otherwise described below:

* **Other users.** Certain information of your personal data may be shared with other users of the Sweatcoin App as part of the normal operation of the Services (for example your uploaded profile picture and biographical information will be accessible to all users, and we may publish your total verified steps, or other movement, during a particular period to other users from time to time).  
* **Service providers**. We may share your personal data with third party service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf, which may include providing data hosting, customer relationship management, payment processing and analytics services. 
* **Business partners**. We may share your personal data with our trusted business partners in order that they can contact you from time to time with offers that may interest you and/or inform you of other products or services, provided you have given your consent for us to do so.
* **Law enforcement, regulators, governmental authorities and other parties for legal reasons.** We may share your personal data with third parties if we are legally required to do so, or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or request, to enforce our terms and conditions, to prevent or resolve security or technical issues, or to protect the rights, property or our safety, or the safety of our users, a third party, or the public.
* **Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction**. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganisation, partnership, asset sale or other transaction, we may disclose your personal data as part of that transaction. 

In addition, we may share your personal data with other third parties if you have provided your consent for us to do so.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

We may transfer your personal data outside of the country where you are located.

If you are located in the UK or EEA, your personal data may be transferred to countries which do not provide the same level of protection for personal data as that provided for under UK and EEA law.

Where we transfer your personal data to a country which is not recognised by the UK government or EU Commission (as applicable) as ensuring an adequate level or protection for personal data, we will ensure that relevant safeguards are in place to ensure the adequate protection for your personal data (for example, by entering into standard contractual clauses with the recipients of your personal data).

Further details regarding the relevant safeguards we implement can be obtained from us on request at [\[email protected\]](https://sweatco.in/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject ‘international transfers’. 

DATA RETENTION

Your personal data will be kept only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes set out in this policy, for as long as we are required to do so by law or any regulatory obligation.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

DATA SECURITY

We take reasonable industry-standard care in keeping all our data secure and in preventing any unauthorised access or unlawful use of it. 

COOKIES

We use cookies and similar technologies on the Sweatcoin App and SweatCo Websites for various purposes, including analytics and advertising. For more information regarding our use of cookies, please refer to Annex 2.
