TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
----------------------------

### Paid Products

Some of the Products provided on Coolors, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment.

The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of Coolors.

To purchase Products, the User must register or log into Coolors.

### Product description

Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of Coolors and are subject to change without notice.

While Products on Coolors are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on Coolors through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.

### Purchasing process

Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

* Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.
* After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.

### Order submission

When the User submits an order, the following applies:

* The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
* In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
* Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.

All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.

### Prices

Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.

Prices on Coolors are displayed:

* either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.

### Methods of payment

Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of Coolors.

All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, Coolors does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.

If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner reserves the right to claim any related expenses or damages from the User.

### Authorization for future PayPal payment

If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, Coolors will store an identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize Coolors to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.

This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the user settings offered by PayPal.

### Purchase via app store

Coolors or specific Products available for sale on Coolors must be purchased via a third-party app store. To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as "Apple App Store" or "Google Play"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.

Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties’ terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.

Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.

### Retention of usage rights

Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.

### Delivery

#### Performance of services

The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on Coolors or as communicated before the order submission.

### Contract duration

#### Subscriptions

Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over time. Details regarding the type of subscription and termination are outlined below.

#### Fixed-term subscriptions

Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.

Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible.

#### Subscriptions handled via Apple ID

Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on Coolors. When doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that

* any payment due shall be charged to their Apple ID account;
* subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;
* any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;
* subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users’ Apple App Store account settings.

The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.

#### Automatic renewal of fixed-term subscriptions

**Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase.**

**The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.**

The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming renewal with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to cancel the automatic renewal.

##### Termination

**Subscriptions may be terminated by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside Coolors.**

**If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.**

#### Exception for Consumers

However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a Consumer, the following applies:

**At the end of the initial term, subscriptions are automatically extended for an unlimited period, unless the User terminates before the end of such term.**

**The fee due upon extension will be charged on the payment method that the User chose during purchase.**

**After extension, the subscription will last for an indefinite period and may be terminated monthly.**

The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming unlimited extension with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to prevent the extension or terminate the subscription thereafter.

##### Termination

**Extended subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside Coolors.**

**If the notice of termination is received by the Owner by the end of the current month, the subscription shall expire at the end of such month.**

User rights
-----------

### Right of withdrawal

Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.

#### The right of withdrawal does not apply on Coolors

Users acknowledge and accept that the right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts concluded over Coolors due to the nature of its offering.

Liability and indemnification
-----------------------------

#### Indemnification

The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees harmless from and against any claim or demand ⁠— including but not limited to lawyer's fees and costs ⁠— made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, infringement of any third-party rights or statutory provision by the User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.

#### Limitation of liability

Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).

This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as Coolors has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.

Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.

Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:

In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.

### Australian Users

#### Limitation of liability

Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.

### US Users

#### Disclaimer of Warranties

**Coolors is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the Service is at Users’ own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties — whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by user from owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.**

**Without limiting the foregoing, the Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet Users’ requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at users own risk and users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users’ computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or Users’ use of the Service.**

**The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services.**

**The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with Users’ web browser, mobile device, and/or operating system. The owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or actual damages arising from Service content, operation, or use of this Service.**

**Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives Users specific legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.**

#### Limitations of liability

**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for**

* **any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and**
* **any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or User account or the information contained therein;**
* **any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;**
* **personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access to or use of the Service;**
* **any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner’s secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein;**
* **any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;**
* **any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Service;**
* **any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or**
* **the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the period of duration of this agreement between the Owner and User, whichever is shorter.**

**This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.**

**Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to User. The terms give User specific legal rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.**

#### Indemnification

**The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees harmless from and against any and all claims or demands, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, arising from**

* **User’s violation of these terms, including, but not limited to, User’s breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in these terms;**
* **User’s violation of any third-party rights, including, but not limited to, any right of privacy or intellectual property rights;**
* **User’s violation of any statutory law, rule, or regulation;**
* **any content that is submitted from User’s account, including third party access with User’s unique username, password or other security measure, if applicable, including, but not limited to, misleading, false, or inaccurate information;**
* **User’s wilful misconduct; or**
* **statutory provision by User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.**

Common provisions
-----------------

### No Waiver

The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision. No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

### Service interruption

To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.

Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or discontinue the Service altogether. If the Service is discontinued, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information and will respect Users' rights relating to continued product use and/or compensation, as provided for by applicable law.

Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner’s reasonable control, such as “force majeure” events( infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts etc.).

### Service reselling

Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of Coolors and of its Service without the Owner’s express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a legitimate reselling programme.

### Privacy policy

To learn more about the use of their Personal Data, Users may refer to the privacy policy of Coolors.

### Intellectual property rights

Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to Coolors are the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties relating to intellectual property.

All trademarks — nominal or figurative — and all other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations, images, or logos appearing in connection with Coolors are, and remain, the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties related to intellectual property.

### Changes to these Terms

The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of these changes.

Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User from the date communicated to Users onwards.

The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service and may terminate the Agreement.

The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from the Owner.

If legally required, the Owner will notify Users in advance of when the modified Terms will take effect.

### Assignment of contract

The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.

Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the written permission of the Owner.

### Contacts

All communications relating to the use of Coolors must be sent using the contact information stated in this document.

### Severability

Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.

#### US Users

Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

#### EU Users

Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.  
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.

Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.

### Governing law

These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

#### Prevalence of national law

However, regardless of the above, if the law of the country that the User is located in provides for a higher applicable consumer protection standard, such higher standards shall prevail.

### Venue of jurisdiction

The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with the courts of the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.

#### Exception for Consumers in Europe

The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European Consumers, nor to Consumers based in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway or Iceland.

#### UK Consumers

Consumers based in England and Wales may bring legal proceedings in connection with these Terms in the English and Welsh courts. Consumers based in Scotland may bring legal proceedings in connection with these Terms in either the Scottish or the English courts. Consumers based in Northern Ireland may bring legal proceedings in connection with these Terms in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.

#### US Users

**Each party specifically waives any right to trial by jury in any court in connection with any action or litigation.**  
**Any claims under these terms shall proceed individually and no party shall join in a class action or other proceeding with or on behalf of others.**

### US Users

#### Surviving provisions

This Agreement shall continue in effect until it is terminated by either Coolors or the User. Upon termination, the provisions contained in these Terms that by their context are intended to survive termination or expiration will survive, including but not limited to the following:

* the User’s grant of licenses under these Terms shall survive indefinitely;
* the User’s indemnification obligations shall survive for a period of five years from the date of termination;
* the disclaimer of warranties and representations, and the stipulations under the section containing indemnity and limitation of liability provisions, shall survive indefinitely.

Dispute resolution
------------------

### Amicable dispute resolution

Users may bring any disputes to the Owner who will try to resolve them amicably.

While Users' right to take legal action shall always remain unaffected, in the event of any controversy regarding the use of Coolors or the Service, Users are kindly asked to contact the Owner at the contact details provided in this document.

The User may submit the complaint including a brief description and if applicable, the details of the related order, purchase, or account, to the Owner’s email address specified in this document.

The Owner will process the complaint without undue delay and within 14 days of receiving it.

### Online dispute resolution for Consumers

The European Commission has established an online platform for alternative dispute resolutions that facilitates an out-of-court method for solving disputes related to and stemming from online sale and service contracts.

As a result, any European Consumer or Consumer based in Norway, Iceland, or Liechtenstein can use such platform for resolving disputes stemming from contracts which have been entered into online. The platform is [available at the following link](http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/).

#### Germany: Dispute resolution procedure with Consumer conciliation boards

The Owner does not participate in alternative dispute resolution procedures for Consumers under the German Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz.

#### France: Mediation

Within one year of submitting a written complaint to the Owner regarding any dispute stemming from these Terms, Consumers have the right to initiate a mediation procedure before

* any mediation body approved by the French Government. The relevant list is available at the following link: [https://www.economie.gouv.fr/mediation-conso/mediateurs-references](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/mediation-conso/mediateurs-references).
