Cookie Policy
=============

Something we missed? [Email us](https://coolors.co/contact)

Cookie Policy of Coolors
------------------------

This document informs Users about the technologies that help Coolors to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with Coolors.

For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.  
For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.

Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.

Coolors uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.  
The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.  
In addition to what’s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.

### Activities strictly necessary for the operation of Coolors and delivery of the Service

Coolors uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.

#### First-party Trackers

Storage duration:

* \_\_Secure-PHPSESSID: duration of the session
* gapi.sessionStorageTest: duration of the session
* NID: 7 months

#### Third-party Trackers

### Traffic optimization and distribution

This type of service allows Coolors to distribute their content using servers located across different countries and to optimize their performance.  
Which Personal Data are processed depends on the characteristics and the way these services are implemented. Their function is to filter communications between Coolors and the User's browser.  
Considering the widespread distribution of this system, it is difficult to determine the locations to which the contents that may contain Personal Information of the User are transferred.

#### Cloudflare (Cloudflare Inc.)

Cloudflare is a traffic optimization and distribution service provided by Cloudflare Inc.  
The way Cloudflare is integrated means that it filters all the traffic through Coolors, i.e., communication between Coolors and the User's browser, while also allowing analytical data from Coolors to be collected.

Personal Data processed: Trackers and various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service.

Legal basis for processing: Contract.

Place of processing: United States – [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

Data retention period: Keeping the data for the duration of the contract (upon termination of the contract, if applicable, as long as required by the applicable law).

### Handling payments

Unless otherwise specified, Coolors processes any payments by credit card, bank transfer or other means via external payment service providers. In general and unless where otherwise stated, Users are requested to provide their payment details and personal information directly to such payment service providers. Coolors isn't involved in the collection and processing of such information: instead, it will only receive a notification by the relevant payment service provider as to whether payment has been successfully completed.

#### Paddle (Paddle.com Market Limited)

Paddle is a payment management service provided by Paddle.com Market Limited, which allows Users to make online payments. Paddle also allows Coolors to measure the performance of their checkout and subscriptions model, and to re-engage and message Users who have shown signs of abandonment.

Personal Data processed: Trackers.

Legal basis for processing: Contract.

Place of processing: United Kingdom – [Privacy Policy](https://paddle.com/privacy-buyers/).

Data retention period: Keeping the data for the duration of the contract (upon termination of the contract, if applicable, as long as required by the applicable law).

### Collection of privacy-related preferences

This type of service allows Coolors to collect and store Users’ preferences related to the collection, use, and processing of their personal information, as requested by the applicable privacy legislation.

#### iubenda Consent Solution (iubenda srl)

The iubenda Consent Solution allows to store and retrieve records of Users’ consent to the processing of Personal Data, and information and preferences expressed in relation to the provided consent.  
In order to do so, it makes use of a Tracker that temporarily stores pending information on the User’s device until it is processed by the API. The Tracker (a browser feature called localStorage) is at that point deleted.

Personal Data processed: Data communicated while using the service and Trackers.

Legal basis for processing: Legal obligation.

Place of processing: Italy – [Privacy Policy](https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/94654098).

#### Other Trackers

### Platform services and hosting

These services have the purpose of hosting and running key components of Coolors, therefore allowing the provision of Coolors from within a unified platform. Such platforms provide a wide range of tools to the Owner – e.g. analytics, user registration, commenting, database management, e-commerce, payment processing – that imply the collection and handling of Personal Data.  
Some of these services work through geographically distributed servers, making it difficult to determine the actual location where the Personal Data are stored.

#### Apple App Store (Apple Inc.)

Coolors is distributed on Apple's App Store, a platform for the distribution of mobile apps, provided by Apple Inc.  
  
By virtue of being distributed via this app store, Apple collects basic analytics and provides reporting features that enables the Owner to view usage analytics data and measure the performance of Coolors. Much of this information is processed on an opt-in basis.  
  
Users may opt-out of this analytics feature directly through their device settings. More information on how to manage analysis settings can be found on this page.  
  
Personal Data processed: Usage Data.

#### Measurement

### Anonymized analytics services

The services contained in this section allow the Owner, through the use of third-party Trackers, to collect and manage analytics in an anonymized form.

#### Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) with anonymized IP (Google Ireland Limited)

Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) is a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited (“Google”). Google utilizes the Data collected to track and examine the use of Coolors, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services.  
Google may use the Data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.  
This integration of Google Analytics anonymizes your IP address. It works by shortening Users' IP addresses within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the complete IP address be sent to a Google server and shortened within the US.

In order to understand Google's use of Data, consult [Google's partner policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

Users can customize their advertising preferences at any time by accessing the advertising preferences panel from within the cookie notice or via the relevant link on Coolors.

Coolors participates in the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework and complies with its Specifications and Policies. Coolors uses iubenda (identification number 123) as a Consent Management Platform.

### Advertising

#### How to control or delete Cookies and similar technologies via your device settings

Users may use their own browser settings to:

* See what Cookies or other similar technologies have been set on the device;
* Block Cookies or similar technologies;
* Clear Cookies or similar technologies from the browser.

The browser settings, however, do not allow granular control of consent by category.

Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&p=cpn_cookies)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)
* [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/)
* [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/block-or-allow-cookies)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027947)
* [Brave](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022806212-How-do-I-use-Shields-while-browsing)
* [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies)

Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).

#### How to opt out of interest-based advertising

Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by [YourOnlineChoices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (EU and UK), the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://thenai.org/about-online-advertising/) (US) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://www.aboutads.info/consumers/) (US), [DAAC](https://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising/) (Canada), [DDAI](http://www.ddai.info/optout) (Japan) or other similar services. Such initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools. The Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.

The Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called [AppChoices](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices) that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.

#### Consequences of denying the use of Trackers

Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers. However, please note that Trackers help Coolors to provide a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, if the User chooses to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to provide related features.
