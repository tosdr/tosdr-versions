Privacy Policy
==============

_View the most recent [archived version](https://www.recordedfuture.com/privacy-policy/4-0)._

_**Version 4.0 — Updated November 22nd, 2024**_

Recorded Future is the world’s most comprehensive and independent threat intelligence cloud platform. It enables organizations to identify and mitigate threats across cyber, supply-chain, physical, and fraud domains. It is trusted by organizations to provide real-time, unbiased and actionable intelligence.

Recorded Future is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains your privacy rights and how we collect, use, share, retain, and transfer personal information (collectively referred to as “processing” or “process”).

### I. POLICY APPLICATION

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we process on or through our websites, our mobile application, our platform (the “**Sites**”), and other offerings (collectively, the “**Services**”) and explains our processing practices, including the personal information we may collect, our use of such personal information, and your privacy rights, including the rights of data subjects that may differ based on location. For example, European Union individuals under the General Data Protection Regulation or California residents pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act.

This Privacy Policy applies to all of Recorded Future’s US Entities and Subsidiaries, listed herein:

* SecurityTrails, LLC
* Regemini, LLC
* Gemini Advisory, LLC
* Recorded Future LLC
* The Record by Recorded Future LLC
* RF Ultimate Parent, Inc.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information we collected:

* when you apply for a job with Recorded Future; or
* in the course of your employment with, or otherwise rendering services to, Recorded Future, whether as an employee, independent contractor, consultant or similar.

By accessing the Services, you agree to our collection and use of personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, our [Terms of Use](https://www.recordedfuture.com/terms-of-use), and/or other agreements as may be executed between us and you or your organization.

### II. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT – SOURCES AND CATEGORIES

Our business focuses on collecting threat intelligence data from, or about, threats for security purposes. Generally, this data does not typically contain information that relates to, or could be used to identify an individual, or be linked with a particular individual or household.

We collect personal information when you visit our Sites and through your interactions with us. For example, when you request information about our Services, when you use our Services (such as submitting queries, performing analysis, or annotating results), subscribe to or read our published content through the Sites, listen to or subscribe to our podcast, indicate your interest in receiving marketing or other materials through our Sites, use our mobile application, provide us with your information to register for, or while at, a conference, event, or webinar, participate in our Community of Practice, when you request product support, or when you voluntarily provide information to us through our Sites or via email or telephone. We also collect personal information from our LinkedIn page and our other social media presences, from third-party commercial sources of personal information, and from publicly available sources including the dark web and open source intelligence.

For more information about our security measures to protect this information, please refer to our [Information Security FAQ](https://www.recordedfuture.com/faq/security).

The categories of personal information we may collect include the following:

* **Personal identifiers:** Name; email, physical or billing addresses; social media handles; telephone numbers; IP address; account number and passwords;
    
* **Internet or other electronic activity information:** Device, operating system and browser information; information regarding your interaction with our Sites; URLs of the pages you visit; mobile application data; logs of browser extension queries and other usage data;
    
* **Professional information:** Name of current employer or company you represent and position(s) you hold; additional professional information you provide to us or post or share with our community;
    
* **Financial information:** credit/debit card information, bank details;
    
* **Commercial information:** Information about queries, analysis, or annotating results that users create by utilizing the Services.
    

**Additional information:** We may collect additional categories of personal data that threat actors, and others, have collected and posted to the dark web or other publicly available sources. We collect such data through our threat intelligence tools. We cannot control or predict the categories of such personal information we may index through our threat intelligence activities, because the contents of such data are dependent upon what external third parties, such as threat actors, may post.

This means that much of the information will relate to high profile people, companies or events (e.g., the President of the United States, CEOs, cybersecurity experts etc.), but it can include information about just about anyone – if that information is in an available source online.

**Information Included in Queries:** Recorded Future offers both free-text search, and sandbox submission functionality, so any personal information included by you in such searches or sandbox submissions may be processed by Recorded Future.

A sandbox end user may upload a file that contains personal information, to include a broader range of personal information than those listed above, however the malware analysis processes the personal data in a manner incidental to the analysis of the file. The public sandbox option does store those analyzed files in a manner that is viewable to other public sandbox users.

**Cookies and Other Technologies**

We collect the above information partly through our use of cookies, which allow Recorded Future to provide customers and site visitors a better and more secure experience. While the exact names and parameters of cookies used by Recorded Future may periodically change, they are generally used for authentication, security, performance, or analytics. These cookies can be deleted at any time. For detailed information on how we use cookies, please [click here](https://www.recordedfuture.com/privacy-policy/3-0/cookies).

Additionally, we use Google Analytics to evaluate the use of our Sites. Google Analytics uses cookies and other identifiers to collect information, such as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they visited prior to visiting a website. To learn more about how Google Analytics collects personal information, review [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US#infocollect).

### III. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

Recorded Future only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized. As a general matter, for the categories of data described in Section III above we may use your personal information to:

* To provide our Services to you or your organization, including: (i) providing access to certain areas, functionalities, and features of our Services; (ii) communicating with you about your account, issues with the Services, account support, security notifications, activities on our Services and policy changes; and (iii) providing access to other content, such as our podcasts. To allow you to register for and attend events, conferences, webinars etc. and to provide you with materials and information (e.g., white papers) you request from us.
    
* To engage in direct marketing activities with you or your organization, including, but not limited to, to send you surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions, contests, and events and to keep you up to date on our Services or to ask you about your experience with our Services.
    
* To understand your actions, behaviors, preferences, expectations, and feedback in order to improve our products and Services, develop new offerings and Services, and to improve the relevance of offers of products and Services by us, to implement settings changes you make.
    
* To ensure network and information security, and compliance with applicable law, including monitoring access to our Services for the purpose of preventing cyber-attacks, unauthorized use of our systems and Sites; export control; prevention or detection of fraud, crime and protection of your personal information.
    
* To enable any due diligence and other appraisals or evaluations for any actual or proposed merger, acquisition, financing transaction or joint venture we or our affiliates may consider.
    
* To defend and enforce our rights including, against legal claims that involve us or our affiliates, and to manage regulatory matters, investigations, data breaches, and/or data subject requests.
    
* To comply with a legal obligation.
    
* To respond to your inquiries and take action on your requests when you contact us through the Sites or by other means.
    
* To pursue our legitimate interests to operate and improve our business.
    

To populate our Intelligence Cloud, Recorded Future processes the intelligence referenced above for certain legitimate business purposes, which may include (but is not limited to) the following:

* Empowering organizations to remediate compromised credentials;
* Locating data that may have been breached or leaked online;
* Tracking vulnerabilities and exploits targeting our customers;
* Providing enrichment for data logs and security infrastructure; and
* Enabling organizations to better research threats.

We analyze threat intelligence to better protect the organizations that use our service, and we believe this makes technology (and the world) more secure.

When we process personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on potential data subjects and their rights under data protection laws.

### IV. COLLECTIVE INSIGHTS AND QUERY DATA

Generally, Recorded Future uses query data in one of two ways -

i) Recorded Future uses this data to provide our services to our customers, this includes everything from returning the query results to providing the search history feature and sending out alerts as configured by users; and

ii) Recorded Future uses unattributed [Customer Data](https://www.recordedfuture.com/terms-of-use/) to develop & improve our offerings. These improvements may include but are not limited to providing a signal to our teams regarding what type of data to improve, what research to pursue, insight into trends, data enrichment, and potential feature improvements.

Additionally, there may be incidents that require access to this data in the event that there is a valid legal request, investigation of a security, safety, or related issue, or enforcement of the Terms of Use.

Further, Recorded Future may index metadata from security events generated through Collective Insights integrations to create correlations. When used on the Recorded Future Platform, this metadata will be devoid of attribution to their original sources.

Recorded Future may share certain parts of this unattributable data with independent third parties for permissible business purposes.

### V. DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES

### VI. DATA SUBJECT PRIVACY RIGHTS

Depending on your location, you may have certain privacy rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), or other applicable laws.

We respond to requests free of charge, but we may charge a reasonable fee for administrative costs in certain situations. In some cases, the law allows us to refuse certain requests.

### IX. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

Some of our Services are hosted in the United States. Therefore, when you disclose personal information to us, we may transfer personal information to the US.

If you are located in the EEA/UK, we may, for the purposes listed in Section III, transfer your personal information to recipients listed in Section V, that may be located in countries outside the EEA/UK, including the US. If the European Commission and/or the United Kingdom considers data protections inadequate in such recipient countries we will take steps to protect the personal information by entering into Standard Contractual Clauses with the recipient parties, or otherwise relying on a derogation for the transfer (e.g., where the transfer is necessary for the defense of legal claims).

To the extent required under applicable law, you can request further information on the data transfer solutions relied upon, including a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by using the contact details below.

**Self-Certification to the Data Privacy Framework (DPF)**

Recorded Future complies with the EU-US DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Recorded Future has certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-US DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-US DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF.

Recorded Future has also certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-US DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-US DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-US DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-US DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

In compliance with the EU-US DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF (together, the “DPFs”), Recorded Future commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your personal information. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPFs should first contact us by emailing privacy \[at\] RecordedFuture \[dot\] com or via mail to: Recorded Future, 363 Highland Avenue Somerville, MA, 02144, USA, Attn: Data Protection Officer. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, we will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.

In compliance with the DPFs, Recorded Future commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPFs to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/dpf-dispute-resolution) for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.

You have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other mechanisms set out in this DPF Notice or our Privacy Policy. For more information, please see Annex 1 of the DPF Principles, available [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction).

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Recorded Future’s compliance with the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (EU-US DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-US DPF). We may be required to disclose personal information we receive under the EU-US DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Recorded Future is liable for the processing of personal information it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Recorded Future shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Recorded Future proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### XI. DATA RETENTION

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for satisfying any legal, cybersecurity, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information together with the necessity and purposes for the processing (including, whether such purposes can be achieved through other means) and the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information.

For more information about applicable retention periods, please review the [Security FAQ Page](https://www.recordedfuture.com/faq/security).

### XII. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We treat your information securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you provide to us.

### XIII. CHILDREN’S INFORMATION

The Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age (or other age as required by local law), and except to the extent authorized by applicable law, we do not knowingly collect or sell personal information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, you may contact us as set forth below.

### XIV. OTHER PROVISIONS

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make changes that materially affect our uses of personal information or your privacy rights, we will announce the changes by providing a notice through our Sites and/or by email.

**Third-Party Websites**

Our Sites may contain social media buttons or links to third-party websites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the activities and practices that take place on those social media platforms or third-party websites. We recommend that you review the privacy policies posted on any platform or website that you may access through our Sites.

We are committed to ensuring that our communications are accessible to people with disabilities. To make accessibility-related requests or report barriers, please contact us at notices \[at\] recordedfuture \[dot\] com.
