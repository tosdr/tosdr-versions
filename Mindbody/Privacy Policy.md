5\. What and How Personal Information May Be Disclosed

Such parties may include, for example, an acquiring or target entity and its advisors.

Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

**Explanation of Individual Rights**

**Right to Correct/Rectify:** You may have the right to rectify any incorrect Personal Information we may hold about you.

**Submitting a Request**

Where applicable law allows for such a right, if you would like to request to access, correct, object to the use, restrict or delete Personal Information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may submit a request through the Mindbody Services themselves or contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://company.mindbodyonline.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject line "Data Subject Request". We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

If you are an End User you may, depending on the Mindbody Service utilized, be able to access, correct or request deletion of Personal Information that you have previously provided to us through your online customer account. These Data Subject Requests and other rights, including objection, restriction and portability (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), can also be made directly to the relevant Subscriber.

For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.

Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information if doing so infringes on the rights of another user.

If you are an End User of one of our Subscribers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Subscribers, or would like request the exercise of a right as set out above in relation to Personal Information held by a Subscriber, please contact the Subscriber directly.

7\. Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of information
----------------------------------------------------------------

Except for health and fitness tracker data that is obtained via third parties, information we collect may be used by Mindbody for marketing purposes such as one-off promotional emailing, mobile text messages, direct mail, and sales contacts. We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. You may:

* **Opt-in or opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us:** If you are a user of the Mindbody App or the Mindbody Consumer Site(s) and no longer want to receive marketing-related emails or mobile text messages from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails or mobile text messages by changing your preferences in your account settings or following the unsubscribe prompts from within the messages themselves. If you have provided your information to Mindbody, and opt-out, Mindbody will put in place processes to honor your request. This may entail keeping some information for the purpose of remembering that you have opted-out.
* **Consent to sharing of your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their (or their customers’) direct marketing purposes:** We only share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third-parties for their marketing purposes when you have consented to the sharing. We do not share data with unaffiliated third-parties in the absence of your consent and such consent will only be valid for a single data transfer. To address what these unaffiliated third-parties do with your data once you have consented to the sharing, please contact the third-party to learn more about your choices.

We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you messages for administrative, transactional or other purposes directly relating to your use of the Mindbody Services, and you cannot opt-out from receiving those messages.

Our mobile applications may also send push notifications to your mobile device, provided you consented to this. If you have previously consented to receiving push notifications and no longer wish to receive them, you can also turn push notifications off at the device level. The applications may also request access to your device’s calendar application, storage, Bluetooth, camera, and microphone. If you have previously allowed access to your device’s calendar and no longer wish to allow access, you may edit the application settings at the device level.

8\. Tracking and Advertising
----------------------------

We, our service providers and partners may collect Other Information and certain Personal Information in a variety of ways. We and/or our service providers may employ various tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and analytics software, that help us better manage content on the Mindbody Services by informing us what content is effective. For more information on our use of cookies and similar technologies, including instructions on how to opt-out, please refer to our [Cookies Policy](https://co.mindbodyonline.com/legal/cookies-and-similar-technologies-policy).

9\. Social Media Features and Widgets
-------------------------------------

The Mindbody Services includes social media features such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are shared with such third parties and governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

10\. Public Forum
-----------------

Our websites offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you disclose Personal Information through Mindbody public message boards, blogs, or forums, as offered through the Mindbody Services, this information may be viewed, collected and used by others. To request removal of your Personal Information from our blog or community forum, please submit a [Support Request](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/contactsupport). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information or some content (if, for example, it is reposted by another user), in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

11\. Sign-In Services
---------------------

You can log in to some of the Mindbody Services using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect, Google or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form. Some services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our websites to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, when using some of our mobile applications we may allow you a chance to tell friends about our services by accessing the contacts in your Facebook or other social media account.

12\. Testimonials, Ratings and Reviews
--------------------------------------

If you submit testimonials, ratings or reviews to the Mindbody Services, any Personal Information you include may be displayed in the Mindbody Services. If you want your testimonial removed, please submit a [Support Request](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/contactsupport).

We also partner with service providers to collect and display ratings and review content on our web sites.

13\. Payment Processors
-----------------------

We currently use payment processors as a Third Party Offering for internet-based payment services. If you wish to make a payment through Mindbody Services, your Personal Information may be collected by such third parties directly and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, third parties’ collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information.

Where a third-party payment processor is utilized as a sub-processor, we have implemented appropriate onward transfer safeguards over your Personal Information. See Section 23 for a list of sub-processors and their applicable privacy policies.

14\. Links To Other Websites
----------------------------

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including our Subscribers and any third party operating any Third Party Offering, site or other products and services used in connection with the Mindbody Services. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Mindbody Services, including our social media pages.

15\. Data Retention
-------------------

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

* The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Mindbody Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Mindbody Services);
* Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
* Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

16\. Security of Your Information
---------------------------------

The security of Personal Information is a high priority at Mindbody. We seek to use reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards designed to protect Personal Information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have any questions about the security of your interaction with us please refer to our [Security Policy.](https://co.mindbodyonline.com/legal/security-policy)

17\. Use of Service By Minors
-----------------------------

The Mindbody Services are not directed or targeted at children under the age of 16, and we request that they do not provide Personal Information through the Mindbody Services.

18\. International Transfers
----------------------------

The Mindbody Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities, namely the United States and the United Kingdom, or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Mindbody Services you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country and whose laws don’t provide the same level of protection as in the European Economic Area (**“EEA”**) or UK. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.

Some non- EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available at [https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/rules-international-data-transfers\_en](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/rules-international-data-transfers_en)). For transfers from the EEA and Switzerland to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission (the United States) we have put in place adequate measures, such as the applicable module(s) of the standard contractual clauses (based on the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as amended or replaced from time to time by a competent authority under the relevant data protection laws and published [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.199.01.0031.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2021:199:TOC), a copy of which can be obtained by contacting us, as set forth in Section 22 below) (the “**Standard Contractual Clauses**”). For transfers from the United Kingdom to countries not considered adequate by the Commissioner, we have put in place the relevant UK Standard Contractual Clauses as amended by the Commissioner for the UK data protection laws and published [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/).

19\. Sensitive Information
--------------------------

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g. information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, genetic characteristics, trade union membership or criminal background) on or through the Mindbody Services or otherwise to us, except where explicitly requested or consented to.

Certain states in the United States, such as California, provide residents a right to limit the use of their sensitive personal information. However, we do not engage in uses or disclosures of sensitive personal information that would trigger the right to limit under state law.

20\. EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We rely on standard contractual clauses (based on the clauses published at [Standard contractual clauses for international transfers | European Commission (europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en) (for the EEA and Switzerland) and [https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/) (for the UK), a copy of which can be obtained by Contacting Us, see below) for transfers of personal data from the EEA.

Nonetheless, and in addition to standard contractual clauses, Mindbody complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Mindbody has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the applicable DPF Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from EEA member countries, the United Kingdon, and Switzerland, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tuc9Crk6EPf5KwOLFyFcei?domain=dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Mindbody is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPR, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Mindbody complies with the EU-U.S. DPF and Swiss-U.S. DPR Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Mindbody’s compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF.  In certain situations, Mindbody may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Mindbody commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the applicable DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/ySvRCv2kYWSDmOZMso5lP_?domain=feedback-form.truste.com) for more information or to file a complaint.  These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you.

For complaints regarding EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and Swiss-U.S. DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. Further information can be found on the official DPF website: [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/ANNEX-I-introduction-dpf?tabset-35584=2.](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/tDuyCzpoB1H0l8zJFVA2jV?domain=dataprivacyframework.gov)
