Mindbody Consumer Agreement
===========================

_Last Updated: August 29, 2024_

This Mindbody Consumer Agreement (the “**Agreement**”) is a legal agreement between you (including your heirs, assigns, and successors) (collectively, “**you**,” “**your**”) and MINDBODY, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “**Mindbody**,” “**we**,” “**our**” or “**us**”) governing your use of Mindbody’s consumer web-based application and/or mobile applications (collectively, the “**Mindbody App**”). Please read this Agreement carefully. By clicking on the “I Accept” button, completing the registration process, and/or downloading, and/or using the Mindbody App, you represent that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement; (2) you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Mindbody; and (3) you have the authority to enter into this Agreement personally or on behalf of the company you have named as the user, and to bind that company to the Agreement. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE MINDBODY APP**.

**THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH MINDBODY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE SEE SECTION 27 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND MINDBODY WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS WIDE ARBITRATION.**

1\. Mindbody App Registration and Account Activation.
-----------------------------------------------------

The Mindbody App allows you to create 1 universal consumer profile that enables you to perform aggregated searches, then schedule and pay for wellness services, including fitness, beauty, integrative health and other services offered by thousands of participating businesses and independent practitioners (“**Mindbody Subscribers**”).  
  
The Mindbody App also enables you to synchronize any consumer accounts you have previously created with Mindbody Subscribers, so that you may view your history of purchases and visits with those providers, use any current series, membership, gift card or account credits you may have with those providers, and to renew or purchase additional services.

The Mindbody App, subject to these terms and payment of applicable fees, may also provide you with an opportunity to purchase a product which will allow you to view video on demand content and to participate in livestreamed fitness classes (“**Flex**”). For the purposes of this Agreement, Flex shall be considered part of the Mindbody App and references to the Mindbody App shall be read as including Flex when made available via the Mindbody App.

To make credit or debit card purchases from Mindbody or the Mindbody Subscribers, you must complete the registration and open an account within the Mindbody App (“**Mindbody App Account**”). You do this by providing your first and last name and email address, completing your email verification, and associating 1 or more valid credit or debit cards with that Mindbody App Account. You must provide accurate and up-to-date information. You are solely responsible for managing your Mindbody App Account. Your Mindbody App Account is non-transferrable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any third party. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Mindbody App Account if you provide inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information or if you attempt to use your Mindbody App Account to engage in illegal or unethical activities.

If you register for the Mindbody App through your Facebook account (“**Facebook Account**”), you are allowing Mindbody to access your Facebook Account as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of your Facebook Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Facebook Account login information to Mindbody and/or grant Mindbody access to your Facebook Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of your Facebook Account and without obligating Mindbody to pay any fees or making Mindbody subject to any usage limitations imposed by Facebook. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH FACEBOOK, AND MINDBODY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO US BY FACEBOOK IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN YOUR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT.

2\. Accepted Payment Methods.
-----------------------------

The Mindbody App allows you to make payments by those methods accepted by Mindbody and the Mindbody Subscribers. Typically, these are card-based methods, including cards bearing the trademarks of Visa Inc., MasterCard International Inc., Discover Inc., and/or American Express Inc. (collectively, the “**Networks**”). Please note that Mindbody and Mindbody Subscribers may not accept all payment methods, including all card-based payment methods. The Networks accepted by Mindbody and each Mindbody Subscriber are displayed in the Mindbody App. We are not a bank, and do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. We also do not offer money service business services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury. You can associate with your Mindbody App Account any U.S.-issued and most non-U.S. issued credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo. Mindbody and Mindbody Subscribers may update at any time the list of card types that they accept and you may associate with your Mindbody App Account. You may not associate Health Savings Account cards with your Mindbody App Account, even if they have a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover logo on them.

3\. Your Authorization for Purchases Made Through the Mindbody App.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

By associating a payment card with your Mindbody App Account, searching for and reserving services in the Mindbody App, and agreeing to pay for those services within the Mindbody App, you are authorizing a charge to your payment card as necessary to complete the purchase. In the event you are entitled to a reversal, refund, chargeback, or other adjustment associated with a purchase you made through the Mindbody App, you also authorize a credit to your payment card to accomplish that transaction.  
  
Purchases you authorize through the Mindbody App may also be subject to terms and conditions set forth by the Networks and/or the entities that issue your card. You are responsible for complying with those terms and conditions, and you are responsible for charges and related fees and billing terms imposed by those terms and conditions as well as any fees and/or surcharges imposed by Mindbody or a Mindbody Subscriber.

4\. Compatible Mobile Devices and Third Party Carriers.
-------------------------------------------------------

Your Mindbody App Account permits you to make payments on a compatible mobile device. Devices modified contrary to the manufacturer’s software or hardware guidelines, including but not limited to disabling hardware or software controls-sometimes referred to as “jailbreaking”, are not compatible mobile devices. You acknowledge that the use of a modified device to use the Mindbody App is expressly prohibited, constitutes a violation of the terms of this Agreement, and is grounds for termination of your Mindbody App Account. Mindbody does not warrant that the Mindbody App will be compatible with your mobile device or third party carrier.

Your use of the Mindbody App may be subject to the terms of your agreements with your mobile device manufacturer and your carrier.

5\. App Stores.
---------------

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Mindbody App is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Mindbody App license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play ("**App Store**"). You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and Mindbody and not with Apple, Google, or their App Stores. Mindbody, not Apple, Google, or their App Stores, is solely responsible for the Mindbody App, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement). In order to use the Mindbody App, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access. You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Mindbody App. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Mindbody App is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the Mindbody App. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will have the right to enforce them.

6\. Restrictions on Use.
------------------------

By using the Mindbody App, you represent, acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years of age, or if you are under 18 years of age but are at least 13 years old (a "**Minor**"), that you are using the Mindbody App with the consent of your parent or legal guardian and that you have received your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission to use the Mindbody App and agree to this Agreement. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you hereby agree to bind the Minor to this Agreement and to fully indemnify and hold harmless Mindbody if the Minor breaches any of the terms of this Agreement. If you are not at least 13 years old, you may not use the Mindbody App at any time or in any manner or submit any information to the Mindbody App or Mindbody. 

The Mindbody App and your Mindbody App Account may only be used in a country or territory where current Mindbody Subscribers exist and the laws of that country or territory permit its use. You may not export the Mindbody App directly or indirectly, and you acknowledge that the Mindbody App may be subject to export restrictions imposed by U.S. law, including U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. Chapter VII). 

By creating a Mindbody App Account, you also confirm that you will not make payments in connection with the following businesses or business activities: (1) any illegal activity; (2) credit counseling or repair agencies; (3) credit protection or identity theft protection services; (4) direct marketing or subscription offers or services; (5) infomercial sales; (6) internet/mail order/telephone order pharmacies or pharmacy referral services (where fulfillment of medication is performed with an internet or telephone consultation, absent a physical visit with a physician including re-importation of pharmaceuticals from foreign countries); (7) multi-level marketing businesses; (8) inbound or outbound telemarketers; (9) prepaid phone cards or phone services; (10) rebate based businesses; (11) upsell merchants; (12) bill payment services; (13) betting, including lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, off-track betting, and wagers at races; (14) financial institutions offering manual or automated cash disbursements; (15) financial institutions offering merchandise and services; (16) sales of money orders or foreign currency by non-financial institutions; (17) wire transfer money orders; (18) high-risk merchants, including telemarketing merchants; (19) service station merchants; (20) automated fuel dispensers; (21) adult entertainment oriented products or services (in any medium, e.g., internet, telephone or printed material); (22) internet/mail order/telephone order firearm or weapon sales; (23) internet/mail order/telephone order cigarette or tobacco sales; (24) drug paraphernalia; (25) hate products; (26) escort services; and/or (27) bankruptcy attorneys.

7\. Mindbody Subscriber Loyalty Programs.
-----------------------------------------

Mindbody Subscribers may choose to offer loyalty programs to reward their customers. These loyalty programs may be linked to your Mindbody App Account. Any such loyalty programs and any rewards associated with them are offered by the Mindbody Subscriber alone (and not by Mindbody). Should you have questions about any Mindbody Subscriber loyalty program, please ask the Mindbody Subscriber for more information about the program, including any applicable terms and conditions. Rewards associated with Mindbody Subscriber loyalty programs have no cash value, and Mindbody Subscriber may choose to discontinue its loyalty program(s) at any time.

8\. Texting Features Consent.
-----------------------------

Mindbody may, from time to time, offer text message programs, including one-time texts and subscription text services, where Mindbody or a Mindbody Subscriber texts you for alerts, promotions and other purposes (“**SMS Texting Services**”). For more information on these services, please visit [SMS Texting Terms and Conditions](https://co.mindbodyonline.com/legal/sms-texting-terms).  
 

To the extent you use any feature of the Mindbody App that enables you to send text message to device holders and you elect to use the feature, you acknowledge that Mindbody only provides a platform for you to send text messages through the Mindbody App and has no responsibility or liability for any such text messages or related message content. Your responsibilities as set forth in this Agreement will remain your sole responsibility and liability even if Mindbody offers advice or guidance regarding the text messages you transmit.

9\. Unauthorized or Illegal Transactions.
-----------------------------------------

We may decide not to process a transaction if we believe that the transaction is in violation of any Mindbody agreement or exposes you, other Mindbody users, our partners, including any Mindbody Subscribers, or Mindbody to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts. If we reasonably suspect that your Mindbody App Account has been used for any unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Mindbody App Account, and/or any of your transactions with law enforcement.

10\. Mindbody App Purchase Information.
---------------------------------------

By using the Mindbody App, you give Mindbody permission to share your email address, first and last name and purchase histories with the Mindbody Subscribers you make purchases with. You also give us permission to import into your Mindbody App Account and to share with Mindbody Subscribers information about purchases you have made using your payment card and any of Mindbody’s products or services. More information can be found in the Mindbody Privacy Policy.

11\. Your Privacy.

12\. Customer Service Disclaimer.
---------------------------------

You understand and agree that Mindbody is not responsible for the goods and services that you purchase through the Mindbody App. Third-party merchants, including Mindbody Subscribers, and not Mindbody, provide those goods and services. These merchants, and not Mindbody, are responsible for customer service related to those goods and services, including the nature, content and quality of the class or appointment, and reservation, cancellation, return and refund policies, adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, technical support, and issues concerning experiences with a merchant’s personnel, policies, or processes. The Networks and/or other entity issuing your payment card, and not Mindbody, is responsible for customer service related to your payment card.

13\. Disclosures and Notices.
-----------------------------

You acknowledge and agree that Mindbody may provide disclosures and other notices required by law and other information about your Mindbody App Account to you electronically by posting them on the Mindbody App or by emailing the email address listed in your Mindbody App Account. You also agree that electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. You are responsible for providing Mindbody with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Mindbody is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by this Agreement, Mindbody’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.

27\. Arbitration Agreement.
---------------------------

_**Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Mindbody and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.**_

**27.1. Purpose.** This Arbitration Agreement facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Mindbody. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.

Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all disputes between you and Mindbody shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).

For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, "Mindbody" means Mindbody and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Mindbody regarding any aspect of your relationship with Mindbody, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. 

WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Mindbody may elect to bring an individual action in small claims court provided, however, that if the case is subsequently removed from small claims court it will be subject to the procedures set out herein.  Further, you or Mindbody may seek relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). 

**27.2. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.** Before initiating any Dispute, whether in court or arbitration, you must first give Mindbody an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by mailing written notification (hereinafter, a “Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to Mindbody - Pre-Arbitration Demand, Attention: Legal Department, 651 Tank Farm Road, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is valid only if it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. That Pre-Arbitration Demand must include (1) your name, (2) your telephone number, email address, residential address, and mailing address, if different than your residential address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, (4) a description of the specific relief you seek, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which you calculated the claimed damages, and (5) your signature.

Following your Pre-Arbitration Demand, before you submit a dispute to arbitration, you must engage in good faith in an informal negotiation process, as specified in this paragraph. This informal negotiation must include an individual meet-and-confer in person, or via teleconference or videoconference, that addresses only the Dispute between you and Mindbody (the “Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference, but you will also need to individually attend and participate. Mindbody will participate in the Conference through one or more representatives, which may include our counsel. Following the informal negotiation, if Mindbody does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 60 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.

You agree that compliance with this subsection is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitration administrator or arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed that does not strictly comply with these informal dispute resolution procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the party against whom an arbitration has been filed has the right to seek a judicial declaration in court regarding whether the arbitration should be dismissed for failure to comply with the informal dispute resolution process set forth in this subsection.

**27.3. Arbitration Procedures.** If the Dispute is not resolved as provided above in the Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution section, either you or Mindbody may initiate arbitration proceedings. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, including its procedural provisions, and not state law, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement. JAMS, [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/), will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.

For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. For Disputes brought as part of mass arbitration, the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines will apply. Mass arbitration is defined as 75 or more similar demands for arbitration filed against the same party or related parties by individual claimants represented by either the same law firm or law firms acting in coordination. The JAMS rules are available at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or by calling 1-800-352-5267. In the event that this Arbitration Agreement conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules, this Arbitration Agreement shall govern. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.

**27.4. Arbitration Award.** The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by applicable federal law, including but not limited to the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

**27.5. Authority of the Arbitrator.** Except as expressly provided herein, the arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Mindbody. Other than as expressly provided in this Arbitration Agreement and the applicable arbitration rules, the Dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Mindbody.

**27.6.****Location of Arbitration.** Arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York, but it may proceed by telephone if you so choose.

**27.7. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs.** If Mindbody is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Mindbody will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against Mindbody, you will be responsible for the applicable initial filing fee. Mindbody will pay both parties’ administrative fees.

**27.8. Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment.** At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for an arbitration hearing with respect to a Dispute, you or we may serve a written offer of judgement on the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitrator, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever is first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs (including all fees paid to the arbitral forum) from the time of the offer.

**27.9. Class Action Waiver.** Any Disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the Mindbody App, this Agreement, or any aspect of your relationship with Mindbody shall be submitted individually by you and will not be subject to any class action or representative status. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) . Neither you, nor any other customer and/or user of Mindbody’s services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding with respect to the matters set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph. You agree that this Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any dispute between you and Mindbody and is non-severable from the Arbitration Agreement. If any portion of this Class Action Waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. You understand that by agreeing to this Class Action Waiver, you may only pursue Disputes against Mindbody in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.

**27.10.  Limitation of Procedural Rights.** You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and Mindbody are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Mindbody might otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). By using the Mindbody website or any Mindbody product or services, or otherwise accepting these Terms, you are entering into this Arbitration Agreement, and you give up those procedural rights. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. YOU AND MINDBODY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL in any litigation between you and Mindbody over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge serving as the finder of fact.

**27.11. Severability.**  If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement, other than the Class Action Waiver clause above, is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**27.12. Survival of Agreement.** This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Mindbody, including your use of the Mindbody website and any Mindbody products or services. 

28\. Choice of Law; Forum.
--------------------------

These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law provisions, consistent with the FAA (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration (including any claims brought by parties outside the United States), the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal courts located in New York County, New York.
