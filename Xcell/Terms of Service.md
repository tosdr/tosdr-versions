In such an event X.Cell reserves the right to introduce fees for the new services offered or amend/introduce fees for existing services, as the case may be. Changes to the Fee Policy shall be posted on the Website and such changes shall automatically become effective immediately after they are posted on the Website. Unless otherwise stated, all fees shall be quoted in UAE Dirhams. You shall be solely responsible for compliance of all applicable laws including those in UAE for making payments to X.Cell.

7\. Order, Pricing and Payment
------------------------------

You agree to pay the full amount payable for the Products as indicated during the order process, including any shipping costs or charges incurred with that order. All prices are displayed in United Arab Emirate Dirhams.

X.Cell may not accept your order for Products if (a) the item/s is/are out of stock; (b) X.Cell is unable to obtain authorisation for your payment; (c) shipping restrictions apply to a particular Product; (d) X.Cell finds a Product or pricing error; or (e) for any other reason at X.Cell’s sole discretion. In any of these situations, X.Cell will inform you that your order has not been accepted, will not process your payment and will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of our decision to decline processing an order, or unwinding or suspending any transaction after processing has begun.

From time to time there may be errors in the pricing that appears on the Website or during the order process. There may also be errors in transmission resulting in the interruption of your purchase. Without admissions, X.Cell will in good faith try to resolve any issues that may arise as a result of such errors. You agree to cooperate with X.Cell to resolve such issues, and you agree that X.Cell shall have full discretion to determine the appropriate resolution in such cases.

All credit/debit card payments are subject to validation by the issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to authorise payment, X.Cell will cancel your order and contact you for an alternative method of payment. X.Cell cannot be held responsible if this should result in a delay in dispatching your goods/Products.

All billing and registration information provided must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information constitutes a breach of these Terms. By confirming your purchase at the end of the process, you agree to accept and pay for the item/s requested.

Certain orders may constitute improper use of the Website and its Services. X.Cell reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your Account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at X.Cell’s sole discretion.

In the event that a Product is listed at an incorrect price due to an error in pricing, X.Cell shall have the right, at X.Cell’s sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any orders placed for that Product. In the event that a Product is mispriced, X.Cell may, at X.Cell’s discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

X.Cell will use reasonable endeavors to provide you with attractive prices on the Website as well as in its stores, however, sometimes the price online will not match the price in a store.

X.Cell reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person per household or per order. These restrictions may be applicable to order placed by same account, the same credit card and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.

8\. Shipping
------------

For X.Cell to arrange to deliver any Products that you have purchased to you, you shall be solely responsible for providing the correct and accurate postal details.

Risk of loss and title for the Products that you purchase on the Website pass to you upon delivery of your purchased Products by the Logistics Supplier.

X.Cell is not responsible for any delays in the shipping of your ordered and purchased Product/s, lost or missing Product/s or the incorrect delivery of the Product/s to you, which is due to your fault or due to inaccurate, false or incomplete information provided by you.

All items are quality controlled and checked for any faults before they are dispatched to you. Should you receive an item that is not in perfect condition please contact us immediately at [support@xcellme.com](mailto:support@xcellme.com) and arrange for the faulty Product to be returned to us.

9\. Returns
-----------

X.Cell wants you to be pleased with your purchase, and so if for any reason you are not completely satisfied, X.Cell will refund your purchase within three (3) days of delivery of your purchased Products. Please go through the Returns Policy available on the Website. Products purchased through the Website should be returned new, unused, in their original packaging and with the original invoice and all Product tags still attached. Returns that are damaged, soiled or altered may not be accepted by X.Cell and may be sent back to you.

All correctly returned Products will be refunded to the original purchaser as credit to the relevant credit/debit card or bank account used for the transaction after deducting the applicable bank charges (if any). If you think that we have provided you with an incorrect refund, please contact us immediately on [support@xcellme.com](mailto:support@xcellme.com)

Please note card refunds may take up to \[15\] business days for your bank to complete, depending on their processing time. This can vary greatly between card issuers, and X.Cell shall not be liable for any delays in refund by card companies. X.Cell offers no guarantees whatsoever for the accuracy or timeliness of the refunds reaching the Customers card/bank accounts.
