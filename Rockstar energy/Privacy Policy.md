**PEPSICO UNITED STATES PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective Date: July 1, 2014; Last Updated: February 13, 2020**

It is our aim through this PEPSICO UNITED STATES PRIVACY POLICY (“Policy”) to explain what information we collect about you and why we collect that information. We also want to make sure you understand how we use and share your information and the choices available to you. Our goal is to earn and keep your trust as you visit websites and applications about our products and brands. 

This Policy describes how we treat personal information on websites (“sites”), mobile or social media applications (“apps”), and any other services where we include an authorized link or reference to this Policy (together, the “Services”). This Policy does not describe our practices on sites or apps where it is not referenced.

Your use of our apps and sites indicates you agree to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as set forth in this Policy.

**What information do we collect?**
===================================

**We collect identifiers and contact information.** For example, we may collect your name and street address if you register on our site or apps. We may also collect your phone number or email address. We also collect online identifiers. For example, if you engage with us through a social media site, we may collect your social media user identifier.

**We collect payment information.** If you make purchases with us, we (or our business partners who process credit cards for us) may collect your billing information. This includes your credit card number.

**We collect information you submit or otherwise provide or authorize us to collect.** We collect the information you post in a public space on our site. This includes comments and videos or photos. We also collect any other information you may provide to us or authorize us to collect. This may include information about your physical activities or your nutrition preferences.

**We collect demographic information and information about your interests.** We may collect information such as your gender and age, household or lifestyle information, and your ZIP Code.

**We collect internet and electronic network activity information, such as device and usage information.** We may collect information about the browser you are using, and we may look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We may also collect information about your operating system, Internet Service Provider (ISP) information and IP addresses and other device identifiers, such as mobile device identifiers. In addition, we may collect information about your use of our Services, including through use of tracking technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, and Flash Cookies. For additional information, please visit our About Our Ads policy [here](https://policy.pepsico.com/aboutads).

**We collect geolocation information.** Using technologies such as GPS or Wi-Fi, we may collect information about your location. For example, if you use our mobile apps, we may access your device’s location information to provide you location-enabled features.

**We collect job application information, such as professional or employment-related information and education information.** We collect information if you apply for a job with us. This information may include your education and work history, your skills, and qualifications for the position. We may ask about how you learned about the position. If applicable, we may ask about your driving record and your ability to perform the position. We may also collect the last four digits of your social security number and your nationality.

**We collect information about third parties.** From time to time, we may allow you to send an email or message to a friend through one of our sites or apps. If you choose to do this, we will need that person’s name and email address.

We do this on our websites, in emails that we send to you, and in media advertising. We collect information about usage and browser information over time. You may learn more about the choices that may be available to you by visiting our About Our Ads policy [here](https://policy.pepsico.com/aboutads).

**Third parties may also share information about you with us.** For example, our business partners may give us information about you. We may receive information from commercial sources such as companies who compile information about shoppers and their preferences. Social media platforms may also give us information about you, and we may get information about your interactions with our ads on third-party sites.

Some information provided by third parties may be aggregated or otherwise deidentified so that it does not identify you. Aggregated and deidentified data are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

We may also share information to help protect you, our sites and apps, our company, our customers, and our consumers. We may also share information if we are investigating potential fraud.

**Third parties may collect information when you use the Services.** Third parties that provide advertising, content, and/or functionality to our Services may collect information from these Services through tracking tools like browser cookies and mobile device IDs.

_Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms__._ Some web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites. Because the standards for these signals are still under development, we currently do not take action in response to these signals.

**You can control tools on your mobile devices.** For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. To modify the push notifications you get from our app, you can alter your preferences in your profile.

**You may have other choices under state laws.** Depending on where you live, you may have certain additional rights, such as the right to request access to your personal information or to request deletion of your personal information.

Requests should be submitted as set out in the “Feel Free to Contact Us If You Have More Questions” section of this Privacy Policy. These rights are not absolute, and we will respond to all requests we receive in accordance with applicable laws.
