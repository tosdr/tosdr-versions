3\. Accepting this Agreement
----------------------------

### 3.1

This Agreement forms a legally binding contract between Provider and Unity, in relation to Provider's use of the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets. In order to use the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets, Provider must first agree to this Agreement by checking the box indicating Provider’s acceptance of this Agreement prior to distributing Assets on the Unity Asset Store. Provider may not distribute Assets on the Unity Asset Store if Provider does not accept this Agreement.

### 3.2

Any person who enters into this Agreement on behalf of Provider represents and warrants that they have full legal authority to bind Provider.

### 3.3

Provider expressly accepts and agrees that Unity shall be entitled to forward Provider's name, address and other contact details to any third Party that reasonably claims that Provider does not have all necessary intellectual property rights, including all necessary patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights, in and to Provider's Assets. Provider also agrees that the handling of personal data in relation to the distribution of its assets on the Unity Asset Store is governed by the Data Processing Addendum found [here](https://unity.com/legal/Controller_DPA_Asset_Store).

### 3.4

Provider understands and agrees that it is solely responsible to Unity and to end users for ensuring that its Assets and, if accepted, the distribution of its Assets on the Asset Store remain in compliance with the [Asset Store Provider Agreement](https://unity.com/legal/provider), the [Unity Copyright Policy](https://unity.com/legal/ip-policy-takedown-requests), the [Guidelines for Using Unity Trademarks](https://unity.com/legal/branding-trademarks), and applicable law.

4\. Pricing and Payments
------------------------

### 4.1

This Agreement covers both licenses for Assets that Provider chooses to distribute for free and for which Provider charges a fee. All fees for licenses for Assets distributed via the Unity Asset Store must be processed by the Payment Processor.

### 4.2

Provider may set the price for licenses to Provider's Assets in US Dollars (USD), so long as the price is not lower than the Floor Price, and subject to Promotion Discounting. The Unity Asset Store may display to Customers the price of Provider's Assets in USD or other currencies that Unity may consider expedient. Unity may choose to set different prices in other currencies, and shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the prices set, or for currency and conversion rates. Consistent with the [EULA](https://unity.com/legal/as_terms), Assets are licensed and not sold. In this Agreement, any references to prices for Assets or the sale/acquisition of Assets are for purposes of convenience only; in all cases this means prices for licenses to Assets or the sale/acquisition of those licenses.

### 4.3

The prices set under Section 4.2 will determine the amount of payment that Provider will receive. In connection with your use of the Unity Asset Store, you acknowledge and agree that all Net Revenue attributable to the sale of Provider Assets belong to Unity, and that Unity will pay you seventy (70) percent of the sales price (less any refunds, bank fees related to the transfer to you, and any applicable taxes) in accordance with these terms. Without limitation of the foregoing, if a customer refund is provided by Unity on your behalf under this Agreement, Unity may deduct and withhold your portion of such refund amount from any current balance. Licenses to your Assets may be offered alongside licenses to other (non-Provider) Assets; in such event, you will receive your payment on a pro rata basis. The aforementioned percentages shall not apply to applicable Program Funds, one hundred (100) percent of Net Revenue which shall be remitted to you, less any applicable bank fees or Taxes related to the transfer. Certain assets or applications might be subject to different payment terms, which will be communicated to you based on our internal analysis and discretion.

**4.3.1** Unity’s agreement to pay a percentage of its Net Revenue to you is conditioned upon you providing Unity complete and accurate information relating to remittance of payment and requested tax information, and subject to adjustments for deductions that may accrue. Unity reserves the right to take any Deductions based on a flat rate imposed across the Unity network or actuals. If payments made to you are not received due to the failure to provide accurate information, failure to cash a check, or otherwise, Unity has no ongoing obligation to hold such funds for you and, after a reasonable time as determined by Unity in its discretion, the funds will continue to be considered property of Unity.

**4.3.2** Net Revenue and payment calculations will be based on Unity’s measurements, which will be the system of record for calculating such sums. The Net Revenue share percentage applicable to you may be varied from time to time in Unity’s discretion.

**4.3.3** PayPal Accounts Paid Monthly. The parties agree that any balance in favor of Provider will be calculated by Unity and made available to Provider via a web page. Unity will use reasonable efforts to pay Provider the applicable balance on a monthly basis as long as Provider provides and maintains a valid PayPal account.

**4.3.4** Wire Payments Paid Quarterly. If Provider fails to provide a valid PayPal account, Unity will pay balances of Net Revenue above USD 250 to Provider on a quarterly basis by wire payment, less applicable bank fees. However, any such account balance of less than 250 USD in favor of Provider at the end of a calendar quarter will not be paid. Instead, such balances below 250 USD will be carried forward to the following calendar quarter.

### 4.4

**4.4.1** Provider is solely responsible for (a) collection and payment of any Taxes on transactions for purchases of licenses for Assets from Provider, including Program Funds; and (b) Taxes on any payments it receives from Unity (or directly from Customers via Program Funds) regardless of which taxing jurisdiction that has jurisdiction concerning such Taxes. For greater certainty, except as otherwise expressly provided by Unity to the contrary, all payments from Unity to Provider are inclusive of Taxes (other than withholding Taxes), and where applicable law requires Unity to withhold any amounts otherwise due to Provider, Unity may withhold such amounts unless Provider tenders to Unity adequate tax documentation supporting lesser withholding Taxes (amounts payable to Provider will not be grossed up on account of withholding Taxes).

**4.4.2** Provider will provide Unity with any and all information and documentation as Unity deems necessary for Unity to account for performance of Provider’s obligations under Section 4.4 and Unity’s own taxation obligations. Without limitation of any other remedies under this Agreement or at law, any Provider failure to provide such information or documentation will be grounds for Unity to suspend payment to Provider under this Agreement indefinitely until provision of such information or documentation. No suspended payment shall accrue or be entitled to any interest of any kind.

**4.4.3** Provider agrees that Unity may, at its option and in its sole discretion, provide means for collection and/or payment under sub-paragraph (a) of Section 4.4.1, in whole or in part, on behalf of Provider. For greater certainty, however, Provider agrees that Unity shall not have or accept any liability for taking any such action; further Unity taking any such action shall not relieve Provider of its obligations under Section 4.4, and Provider shall at all times be liable for performance of such obligations.

**4.4.4** If a Customer chooses to contribute Program Funds but Provider has not provided Unity with sufficient Payment Processor information to process Program Funds, Unity may contribute the Program Funds to a charitable organization of its choice. (For clarity, the terms “donation,” “charitable organization,” and “contribution” are informational only and not intended as tax or legal advice. Program Funds are taxable and Provider will not be entitled to any tax deduction in connection with the Program.)

### 4.5

Provider may also choose to distribute Assets for free. If the Asset is free, there shall be no Net Revenue. Provider may not in the future collect charges from Customers for copies of the Assets that those Customers previously downloaded for free. Providers distributing Assets for free are still entitled to join any Support the Creator-Program by setting up a Payment Processor account as set forth in this Section 4.

### 4.6

Refund Requirements

**4.6.1** In addition and without prejudice to the Payment Processor's standard terms and conditions regarding refunds, the following terms apply to Provider's distribution of Assets on the Unity Asset Store:

**4.6.2** Provider authorizes Unity to give the Customer a full refund of the price for a license to any Asset on Provider’s behalf if the Customer requests the refund within 2weeks after purchase, and Provider has not provided any refund directly to the Customer, in any of the following circumstances:

(i) the Asset was not as advertised (including any demo made available);

(ii) the Asset is not compatible with the most recent official release of Unity and no information was provided at the Unity Asset Store to indicate that Asset is so incompatible; or

(iii) the Asset includes unauthorized intellectual property.

**4.6.3** In the event that a Customer returns any Asset and/or receives a refund, all license rights granted herein terminate and under the [EULA](https://unity.com/legal/as_terms) and the Customer will be instructed to immediately destroy any and all copies contained on any type of media under the control or possession of the Customer.

### 4.7

Provider Support

**4.7.1** Provider will be solely responsible for support and maintenance of Provider's Assets and any complaints about Provider's Assets. Provider's contact information will be displayed in each Asset detail page and made available to Customers for customer support purposes.

**4.7.2** Failure to provide adequate support for Provider's Assets may result in low Asset ratings, less prominent Asset exposure, low sales and billing disputes. In the event of disputes for Assets sold for less than 50 USD, Unity may at Provider's expense decide that the full purchase price shall be refunded to the Customer and charged back in full to the Provider, in addition to any handling fees charged by the Payment Processor. Chargeback requests for Assets sold at 50 USD or more will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor's standard policy.

### 4.8

Reinstalls

Provider acknowledges and agrees that Customers that have licensed an Asset will have the ability to access and download the Asset for as long as the Asset is available on the Asset Store. Customer’s use of the Asset shall remain subject to the [EULA](https://unity.com/legal/as_terms).

### 4.9

Donations

**4.9.1** Providers of free Assets may request and accept indirect donations for their work, provided that the following conditions are complied with:

**4.9.1.1** Donations shall be handled via the Provider’s own payment transaction system on their own website.

**4.9.1.2** Provider's free Assets may not have a special enhanced version of this Asset which Provider markets outside of the Unity Asset Store (and thus circumventing the payment in favor of Unity, as specified in 4.3 above.

**4.9.1.3** Assets themselves may not explicitly mention, prompt or request donations when embedded in a built Unity project (executable, browser game, etc.) nor in the editor if it uses editor classes.

**4.9.1.4** Donation requests shall be mentioned by use of the text: “donations accepted” on the Asset’s Asset Store page/description itself.

5\. Use of the Unity Asset Store by Provider
--------------------------------------------

### 5.1

### 5.2

Further, Provider may only use that information for the limited purposes for which the Customer has given Provider permission to do so. If Provider's Assets store personal or sensitive information provided by Customers, it must do so securely and only for as long as it is needed and in full compliance with any applicable law regarding Provider's access or use of such information. But if the Customer has opted into a separate agreement with Provider that allows Provider or Provider's Asset to store or use personal or sensitive information directly related to Provider's Asset then the terms of that separate agreement and any applicable privacy laws will govern Provider's use of such information.

### 5.8

Asset Ratings

Unity reserves the right to display Assets to Customers in a manner that will be determined at Unity's sole discretion.

### 5.10

Technical Compatibility

In the event that these submissions fail to meet the technical compatibility criteria, Unity reserves the right to undertake measures such as, but not limited to, rejection, modification, requesting alterations, or removal of such submissions on the grounds of insufficient technical compatibility.

If Provider does not provide such a refund on request, Provider authorizes Unity to provide such refund on Provider’s behalf.

### 8.2

Unity Takedowns

In addition, Unity shall itself be entitled to edit and make changes in the Asset. Finally, Unity shall be entitled to remove the Asset from the Unity Asset Store immediately, or reclassify the Asset at its sole discretion and without any liability. Unity reserves the right to suspend and/or bar any Provider from the Unity Asset Store at its sole discretion.
