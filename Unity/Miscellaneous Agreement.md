3\. Accepting this Agreement
----------------------------

### 3.1

This Agreement forms a legally binding contract between Provider and Unity, in relation to Provider's use of the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets. In order to use the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets, Provider must first agree to this Agreement by checking the box indicating Provider’s acceptance of this Agreement prior to distributing Assets on the Unity Asset Store.

Provider also agrees that the handling of personal data in relationship to the distribution of its assets on the Unity Asset Store is governed by the Controller-Controller Asset Store Addendum found [here](https://unity.com/legal/Controller_DPA_Asset_Store).

4\. Pricing and Payments
------------------------

### 4.1

This Agreement covers both licenses for Assets that Provider chooses to distribute for free and for which Provider charges a fee. All fees for licenses for Assets distributed via the Unity Asset Store must be processed by the Payment Processor.

### 4.2

Provider may set the price for licenses to Provider's Assets in US Dollars (USD), so long as the price is not lower than the Floor Price, and subject to Promotion Discounting. The Unity Asset Store may display to Customers the price of Provider's Assets in USD or other currencies that Unity may consider expedient. Unity may choose to set different prices in other currencies, and shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the prices set, or for currency and conversion rates.

### 4.3

The prices set under Section 4.2 will determine the amount of payment that Provider will receive. 70 (seventy) percent of the sales price (less any refunds, bank fees related to the transfer to the Provider and less any Taxes) will be remitted by Unity to the Provider; the remaining 30 (thirty) percent will be allotted to and retained by Unity. Without limitation of the foregoing, where a refund is provided by Unity on Provider’s behalf under this Agreement, Unity may deduct and withhold Provider portion of such refund amount from any current Provider balance. Licenses to Provider Assets may be offered via the Unity Asset Store with licenses to other (non-Provider) Assets; in such event, Provider will receive its payment pro rata. The foregoing percentages shall not apply to applicable Program Funds, 100 (one hundred) percent of which shall be remitted to Provider, less any applicable bank fees or Taxes related to the transfer to Provider.

**4.3.1** PayPal Accounts Paid Monthly. The parties agree that any balance in favor of Provider will be calculated by Unity and made available to Provider via a web page. Unity will use reasonable efforts to pay Provider the applicable balance on a monthly basis as long as Provider provides and maintains a valid PayPal account.

**4.3.2** Check or Wire Payments Paid Quarterly. If Provider fails to provide a valid PayPal account, Unity will pay balances above USD 250 to Provider on a quarterly basis by check or wire payment, less applicable bank fees. However, any such account balance of less than 250 USD in favor in of Providerat the end of a calendar quarter will not be paid. Instead, such balance below 250 USD will be carried forward to the following calendar quarter. In the event that the balance for a period of eight consecutive calendar quarters remains below 250 USD, then Unity will pay such balance to Provider, less any bank fees related to the transfer to the Provider. The current applicable bank fees for check or wire payments are set forth in the Asset Store.

**4.3.3** Notwithstanding anything else herein, if Provider is an individual and resident in Denmark, provision to Unity of Provider's tax identification number registered with the Danish Central Business Register ("CVR Number") shall be a condition precedent to any payment obligation of Unity's under this Agreement; for greater certainty, (a) unless and until Unity is provided with the Provider's CVR Number, Unity is under no obligation to make any payment to the Provider; and (b) upon being provided with the CVR Number, accrued amounts will become payable hereunder, but no interest will be payable on those amounts.

### 4.4

**4.4.1** Provider is solely responsible for (a) collection and payment of any Taxes on transactions for purchases of licenses for Assets from Provider, including Program Funds; and (b) Taxes on any payments it receives from Unity (or directly from Customers via Program Funds) regardless of which taxing jurisdiction that has jurisdiction concerning such Taxes. For greater certainty, except as otherwise expressly provided by Unity to the contrary, all payments from Unity to Provider are inclusive of Taxes (other than withholding Taxes), and where applicable law requires Unity to withhold any amounts otherwise due to Provider, Unity may withhold such amounts unless Provider tenders to Unity adequate tax documentation supporting lesser withholding Taxes (amounts payable to Provider will not be grossed up on account of withholding Taxes).

**4.4.2** Provider will provide Unity with any and all information and documentation as Unity deems necessary for Unity to account for performance of Provider’s obligations under Section 4.4 and Unity’s own taxation obligations. Without limitation of any other remedies under this Agreement or at law, any Provider failure to provide such information or documentation will be grounds for Unity to suspend payment to Provider under this Agreement indefinitely until provision of such information or documentation. No suspended payment shall accrue or be entitled to any interest of any kind.

**4.4.3** Provider agrees that Unity may, at its option and in its sole discretion, provide means for collection and/or payment under sub-paragraph (a) of Section 4.4.1, in whole or in part, on behalf of Provider. For greater certainty, however, Provider agrees that Unity shall not have or accept any liability for taking any such action; further Unity taking any such action shall not relieve Provider of its obligations under Section 4.4, and Provider shall at all times be liable for performance of such obligations.

4.4.4 If a Customer chooses to contribute Program Funds but Provider has not provided Unity with sufficient Payment Processor information to process Program Funds, Unity may contribute the Program Funds to a charitable organization of its choice. (For clarity, the terms “donation,” “charitable organization,” and “contribution” are informational only and not intended as tax or legal advice. Program Funds are taxable and Provider will not be entitled to any tax deduction in connection with the Program.)

### 4.5

Provider may also choose to distribute Assets for free. If the Asset is free, Unity shall not be entitled to receive the 30 (thirty) per cent listed in Section 4.3 above. Provider may not in the future collect charges from Customers for copies of the Assets that those Customers previously downloaded for free. Providers distributing Assets for free are still entitled to join any Support the Creator-Program by setting up a Payment Processor account as set forth in this Section 4.

### 4.6

Refund Requirements

**4.6.1** In addition and without prejudice to the Payment Processor's standard terms and conditions regarding refunds, the following terms apply to Provider's distribution of Assets on the Unity Asset Store:

**4.6.2** Provider authorizes Unity to give the Customer a full refund of the price for a license to any Asset on Provider’s behalf if the Customer requests the refund within 2weeks after purchase, and Provider has not provided any refund directly to the Customer, in any of the following circumstances:

(i) the Asset was not as advertised (including any demo made available);

(ii) the Asset is not compatible with the most recent official release of Unity and no information was provided at the Unity Asset Store to indicate that Asset is so incompatible; or

(iii) the Asset includes unauthorized intellectual property.

**4.6.3** In the event that a Customer returns any Asset and/or receives a refund, all license rights granted herein terminate and under the [EULA](https://unity.com/legal/as_terms) and the Customer will be instructed to immediately destroy any and all copies contained on any type of media under the control or possession of the Customer.

### 4.7

Provider Support

**4.7.2** Failure to provide adequate support for Provider's Assets may result in low Asset ratings, less prominent Asset exposure, low sales and billing disputes. In the event of disputes for Assets sold for less than 50 USD, Unity may at Provider's expense decide that the full purchase price shall be refunded to the Customer and charged back in full to the Provider, in addition to any handling fees charged by the Payment Processor. Chargeback requests for Assets sold at 50 USD or more will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor's standard policy.

### 4.8

Reinstalls

Provider acknowledges and agrees that Customers that have licensed an Asset will have the ability to access and download the Asset for as long as the Asset is available on the Asset Store. Customer’s use of the Asset shall remain subject to the [EULA](https://unity.com/legal/as_terms).
