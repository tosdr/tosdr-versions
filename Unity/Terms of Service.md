Unity Additional Terms

Unity Software, Online Services, Support Services, Site and Communities, Learning Products & Services, and Private Alphas are subject to additional terms as shown below (“**Additional Terms**”). For clarity, unless otherwise indicated in specific Additional Terms, Services are provided by Unity Technologies SF.

These Additional Terms relate to the various Offerings that Unity makes available to you from time to time. If you Purchase or use an Offering, you agree to the applicable Additional Terms set forth below, and if you do not Purchase or use such Offering, the applicable Additional Terms do not apply to you.

The Additional Terms supplement the [Unity Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service) (the “**Terms**”). In the event of any conflict between the Additional Terms and the Terms, the Additional Terms shall control.

Capitalized terms used but not defined therein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, any Commercial Terms applicable to you that supplements, amends, supersedes or replaces these Additional Terms (for example, an enterprise business agreement) shall control.
