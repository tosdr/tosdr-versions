Unity Website & Communities

**Additional Terms**

Last updated: February 27, 2024

What’s changed: We have updated our Unity Website & Communities Terms. The changes include updating Section 2 (User Content) to clarify the definition of children as per the applicable laws, as well as specifying the inclusion of our Content Transparency page in compliance with the Digital Services Act. We invite you to carefully review the updated Terms. The previous version of the Software Terms is accessible [here](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/site-and-communities-legacy).  

Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise at the Site, your use of the Site and/or Communities is subject to these Additional Terms (the “**Site Terms**”), which supplement and incorporate the [Unity Terms of Service](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service). By accessing the Site and/or Communities in any manner, you represent and affirm that you have read, understand and agree to be legally bound by and comply with these Site Terms. If you do not agree with these Site Terms, you are not authorized to use the Materials in any manner.

**1\. Rights to use Website Content.**
--------------------------------------

Subject to your compliance with the Agreement, Unity grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license, without the right to sublicense, to access, view, download and print any Website Content solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Site, Communities, Website Content or User Content, except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Unity or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.

**2\. User Content.**
---------------------

User Content (including Your Site Content) does not include games or other tools that users submit via the Unity Asset Store, or games created with the Unity game development platform. You acknowledge and agree that all information, data, text, or other materials, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom the User Content originated. By making available any User Content through the Site and Communities, you hereby grant to Unity a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, access, view, and otherwise exploit such User Content only on, through or by means of the Site, the Communities and in Unity's social media channels. Unity does not claim any ownership rights in any such User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit any such User Content. For the purposes of these Terms, Content does not include User Content.

If you elect to post Your Site Content to the Site or in the Communities, you further represent and warrant that: (i) Your Site Content and your use of the Site and Communities will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations; (ii) you own or control all rights in Your Site Content or otherwise as necessary to grant the rights and licenses you grant to Unity pursuant to the Agreement; (iii) if applicable, you will properly designate whether or not Your Site Content is directed towards children (as children may be defined by applicable law); (iv) Your Site Content does not include any offensive, defamatory, pornographic hateful, abusive or otherwise objectionable materials; (v) Your Site Content does not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property or proprietary rights of any person or entity; and (vi) Your Site Content not contain any viruses, malware, spyware, malicious code or other destructive content that could have an adverse impact on any software, data, computer systems, networks, hardware or and devices.

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all of Your Site Content and that your user name may be associated with Your Site Content.

**3\. Private Messages.**
-------------------------

Certain Communities give users the ability to send each other private messages through the Private Message functionality. While Unity does not normally access or screen private messages, we reserve the right to access private message content in instances of suspected or alleged harassment, offensive behavior, spam or as required by a law enforcement agency. If you use the private message system in a way that violates these Terms, we may ban you from using private messaging or from having access to the Communities.

**4\. Feedback.**
-----------------

We welcome and encourage you to provide Feedback. You may submit Feedback via the Site. You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of Unity and you hereby irrevocably assign to Unity and agree to irrevocably assign to Unity all of your right, title, and interest in and to all Feedback, including without limitation all worldwide patent, copyright, trade secret, moral and other proprietary or intellectual property rights therein. At Unity’s request and expense, you will execute documents and take such further acts as Unity may reasonably request to assist Unity to acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual property rights and other legal protections for the Feedback.
