Unity – Data Processing Addendum ("DPA")

**Unity – Data Processing Addendum**

**Effective : December 4, 2024**

_What's changed?_

On December 4, 2024, we incorporated ironSource's services into our Unity – Data Processing Addendum (DPA). The revised DPA now encompasses all ironSource's services, including specific provisions related to Aura Platform Services. We revised our role in relation to Unity LevelPlay from a "Data Processor" to a "Data Controller". We provided an updated link to our list of Sub-processors, provided a link to our technical and organizational measures, and clarified the "List of Parties" definition in the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). We additionally clarified our position when personal data is transferred via a Processor Service in conjunction with and transmitting data to a Controller Service.

  
This Data Processing Addendum (this “DPA”) is incorporated into and forms an integral part of the Unity Terms of Service, available at [https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service),the Unity Advertising Terms of Service, available at [https://unity3d.com/legal/one-operate-services-terms-of-service](https://unity3d.com/legal/one-operate-services-terms-of-service), the Asset Store Terms of Service and EULA, available at [https://unity.com/legal/as-terms](https://unity.com/legal/as-terms), and the Asset Store Provider Agreement, available at [https://unity.com/legal/as-provider](https://unity.com/legal/as-provider), or, as applicable, an offline agreement relating to the subject matter therein (the “Terms of Service”) between You and the Unity Party specified in Section 2.22 below., on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, inclusive of ironSource (collectively, “Unity”) and you (“Customer” or “you”), each a “party” and collectively the “parties”. Acceptance of the Terms of Service includes acceptance of this DPA. Capitalized but undefined terms used in this DPA will have the meanings assigned to those terms in the Terms of Service.

To the extent you are using the services named herein and absent any other offline agreement, you shall be deemed to have accepted this DPA and applicable Standard Contractual Clauses upon acceptance or execution of the applicable Terms of Service.
