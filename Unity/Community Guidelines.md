Bug submission Additional Terms

Last updated: 28 January 2022

WHO DO THESE TERMS AFFECT
-------------------------

In these Bug Submission terms Unity may be referred to as **‘we’** or **‘our’**. Unity Users may be referred to as **‘you’** or **‘your’**.

If you are submitting a bug on behalf of a company, organization or other legal entity (a “**Legal Entity**”), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Legal Entity to these Bug Submission Terms and, in such event, “**you**” and “**your**” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.

WHAT DO THESE TERMS DO
----------------------

These set out the terms and conditions applicable to Unity Users who have submitted notice of a bug, issue or vulnerability in Unity Software via The Unity Bug Reporter (using Unity Editor or Unity Hub) to Unity (a **Bug Submission**) . In addition, the terms and conditions contained in the [Unity Terms of Service](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service) are incorporated into these Bug Submission Terms. Upon submitting a bug to Unity via The Unity Bug Reporter you are bound by and are obligated to comply with the Bug Submission Terms.

By **bug, issue or vulnerability** we mean a software defect, unintentional behaviour or usability issue affecting the Unity Engine or Unity Hub.

THE BUG SUBMISSION PROCESS
--------------------------

If you believe you have discovered a bug, please create a submission through The Unity Bug Reporter.

Each Bug Submission will be updated with significant events, including when the issue has been validated, when we need more information from you, or have resolved the issue.

Each submission is evaluated by a testing engineer from Unity’s Customer QA team and if confirmed as a valid bug, escalated to the relevant team of developers.

What Unity will do:

* Try to reproduce the issue, using the information provided and your submitted project, if one was provided. If the issue could not be reproduced, you may be contacted for additional information.
* If the issue is found to be a valid bug, it is submitted to the relevant developer team for a resolution, otherwise the behaviour is explained to you, and if possible a workaround is provided.
* Once the issue has been resolved, it will be reviewed and the user may be notified by the Customer QA team. If the resolution is a fix for the bug, the Customer QA team will also verify the fix has worked before informing the user.

BUG SUBMISSION RULES
--------------------

We are committed to protecting the interests of Unity Users.

Please carefully read these rules:

* Issues reported that affect only unsupported platforms or systems may be rejected at any time
* Communication regarding bug submissions must remain within the email conversation and or official Unity support channels for the duration of the disclosure process
* Submissions may be closed if you/ the correspondent is non-responsive to requests for more information after 7 days
* These Bug Submission Terms apply to all submissions made through the Unity Bug Reporter. Unless you request otherwise (either in your Bug Submission or in related communications with us) your Bug Submission will be publicly visible in the Issue Tracker by default, when converted to a bug. The information that becomes public when a bug is visible in the Issue Tracker is:
    * Bug Title - The issue summarized in one sentence
    * Bug Description - Reproduction steps, Affected Versions, Expected and Actual results, Any additional information relevant to the issue
    * Case ID of the issue.
