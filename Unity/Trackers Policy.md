Unity Advertising Terms of Service

Last Updated: April 1, 2024

To provide our clients with better experience, we have unified the legal terms of certain UnityAds, ironSource and Tapjoy offerings, as further detailed herein, whereas each offering is provided, operated, and billed independently and separately by the designated entity, as detailed below.  
  
If you were directed to this page in connection with your use of any Game Service, Engage Service, Multiplayer Service, or Consulting Service, please note that the applicable terms are now available at the following link: https://unity.com/legal (or a different URL Unity may provide from time to time).

  
These Terms of Service (the General Terms and, together with the Additional Terms, the “Terms”) are a binding agreement between you and Unity Technologies SF, an entity duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of California, USA (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, “Unity”), and govern your use or access to the Services made available to you by Unity. Certain Services may be provided by different Affiliates of Unity, with invoices issued by the applicable Affiliate. For example, ironSource Mobile Ltd. (“**ironSource**”) and Tapjoy, Inc. (“**Tapjoy**”) are two separate Affiliates of Unity’s, and each provides advertising and monetization Services independently within its own network, and the term Unity in the Terms shall apply to such Affiliate, as applicable. If you are a client of the ironSource offerings, you will receive invoice(s) issued by and payable to ironSource pursuant to the payment-related terms provided herein. Some Services may require you to accept additional terms and conditions in order to use or access such Services. With regards to such Services, your agreement shall also constitute a binding agreement between you and the Unity entity.  
  
The term “you” as used in these Terms means either an individual utilizing any of the Offerings in his or her individual capacity or the company or other entity affiliated with an individual utilizing any of the Offerings on behalf of that company or other entity.  
  
By clicking to accept these Terms, registering for any of the Offerings or accessing, enabling or utilizing any of the Offerings or Service Assets (including access, enablement or utilization based on a “free,” “evaluation,” or “trial” basis), you represent that you have read, understand, accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not accept and agree with these Terms you are not authorized to use any of the Offerings or Service Assets.  
  
If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other entity (e.g., an Agency on behalf of an advertiser), you represent that you are a duly authorized employee or agent of such company or other entity with the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of such company or other entity and that such company or other entity will be bound by these Terms. In such a case, the term “you” will also refer to such third party or parties on a joint and several basis. If you are an individual entering into these Terms on your own behalf, you represent that you are the age of legal majority or older and have the legal capacity to enter into and be bound by these Terms.  
  
Unity may, from time to time, modify these Terms at its discretion. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Offerings or any of the Services Assets following modifications made to these Terms or any of the Policies constitutes your acceptance of them.
