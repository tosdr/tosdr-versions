These Terms of Service (the General Terms and, together with the Additional Terms, the “Terms”) are a binding agreement between you and Unity Technologies SF, an entity duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of California, USA (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, “Unity”), and govern your use or access to the Services made available to you by Unity. Certain Services may be provided by different Affiliates of Unity, with invoices issued by the applicable Affiliate. Some Services may require you to agree to additional terms and conditions in order to use or access such Services. With regards to such Services, your agreement shall also constitute a binding agreement between you and the applicable Unity entity.  
  
The term “you” as used in these Terms means either an individual utilizing any of the Offerings in his or her individual capacity or the company or other entity affiliated with an individual utilizing any of the Offerings on behalf of that company or other entity.  
  
By clicking to accept these Terms, registering for any of the Offerings or accessing, enabling or utilizing any of the Offerings or Service Assets (including access, enablement or utilization based on a “free,” “evaluation,” or “trial” basis), you represent that you have read, understand, accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not accept and agree with these Terms you are not authorized to use any of the Offerings or Service Assets.  
  
If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other entity (e.g., an Agency on behalf of an advertiser), you represent that you are a duly authorized employee or agent of such company or other entity with the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of such company or other entity and that such company or other entity will be bound by these Terms. In such a case, the term “you” will also refer to such third party or parties on a joint and several basis.
