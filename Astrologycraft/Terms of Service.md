Any such arbitration shall be conducted in the State of New York, or in such other place as may be mutually agreed between us and you (collectively, the “Parties”) and shall be heard by a panel of one arbitrator mutually acceptable to the Parties or, if the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the rules of JAMS.
