At ![Innover Online Media Group Ltd](//astrologycraft.com/common/images/entity_name.png), we provide our users with feature-focused websites, browser extensions & applications that are geared to customized and more specific browsing experiences. Our products facilitate specific functionality and provide ease of access to information and widgets that can be accessed from the new tab, start page and/or via browser search settings.

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of persons ("you(r)") who visit, access our website, download, install and/or use our browser extensions/add-ons (the "Extension") for search applications installed on your computer or mobile device.

This document describes our obligations under applicable data protections laws, and explains what type of information we are collecting and how we are using this information.

### 1\. What information we process:

In the course of browsing our websites, installing our products and using our product, we capture the following:

1. Information necessary to the proper functioning of the Extension. Based on the Extension's functionality, we may collect certain types of information that you explicitly provide to us. The type of information depends on the specific Extension but may include package tracking numbers, flight information and routes, and (on a temporary basis and in no case for more than seven days) certain files you choose to upload. Other types of information necessary to the Extension may be collected but stored only on your computer (i.e., we do not store it on our server). This latter category depends on the specific Extension but may include your astrological sign, your reminders and to-do lists, your recipe search terms and recipes, and your map search queries.
2. Information you provide to us. We may collect other types of information that you explicitly provide to us through your use of the Extension, including search terms entered by you within the Extension and associated sites, and any other information provided by you (including your name, telephone number and/or email address) if submitted by you as part of a feedback form, crash report, enhancement suggestion or other communication from you to us.
