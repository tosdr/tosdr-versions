These terms and conditions control how You may use the TMDB APIs, including (i) any content (including audio or visual content) or other information available through, on, or from the TMDB APIs or TMDB (such content or information, "TMDB Content"), (ii) all updates, revisions, substitutions to the TMDB APIs, and (iii) any copies of the TMDB APIs made by or for You. TMDB reserves all rights not expressly granted herein, including the right to make derivatives of the TMDB APIs or TMDB Content, or to use the TMDB APIs or TMDB Content in connection with, or for training, a machine learning or artificial intelligence based Application.

* Giving TMDB attribution for all TMDB Content, as specified in Paragraph 3 (Attribution), below.

**C. Restrictions.** In addition, You must not:

* Attempt to cloak or conceal Your identity, or the identity of any website, program, service, application, or other product (collectively "Application(s)") that accesses TMDB or the TMDB APIs, when using or requesting authorization to use TMDB APIs.
* Use, or create any Application that, in Our sole discretion, (i) uses an excessive amount of bandwidth, (ii) degrade or impairs, including in part, access to, or use of, TMDB, its systems and servers, or the TMDB APIs; or (iii) otherwise adversely impacts the stability of TMDB, its systems and servers, or adversely impacts other users of TMDB or the TMDB APIs.
* Cache, for longer than 6 months, any information obtained through or from TMDB or the TMDB APIs.

### 2\. Commercial Use

**A. Commercial Use Requires a Commercial Agreement.** The license in Paragraph 1.A above does not permit any commercial use of TMDB, the TMDB APIs, or TMDB Content.

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, AND EXCEPT FOR INTENTIONAL BODILY INJURY, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TMDB OR TMDB REPRESENTATIVES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER ANY TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE API, EVEN IF TMDB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.

### 8\. Release and Waiver

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and waive all claims against TMDB, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers, agents, licensors, suppliers, co-branders or other partners, contractors, and employees (collectively "TMDB Representatives") from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and/or consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising from or in any way related to Your use of TMDB, the TMDB APIs, or TMDB Content.
