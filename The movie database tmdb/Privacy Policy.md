**Cookies and Similar Technologies**

When you visit TMDB websites, we and our advertising partners may store and access information from your device, including using "cookies", clear GIFs (which are also sometimes called web bugs or web beacons) and browser details. We may collect information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, IP address, pages visited on the site, services used and how you have used them. We and our advertising partners do this for a variety of purposes. In the case of our advertising partners, this may include the personalization of advertisements based on your visits to sites in that party's network.

Please note there is currently no accepted standard to respond to Do Not Track signals and that at least some of the TMDB websites do not currently respond to a web browser's Do Not Track instructions (i.e., "signal"). More information about Do Not Track can be found here. Additionally, we may use Google analytics. Google analytics manages 'Do Not Track' instructions from your browser in accordance with its own privacy policies http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

Another example of how we use cookies might be to track the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns and to show you TMDB ads on other websites after you have visited our website. Please note: if you continue to use this website, or any other TMDB website, you are consenting to our use of cookies. Information about our use of cookies is contained in our Cookie Policy at https://www.tivo.com/legal/cookies.

**Interest-Based Advertising and Analytics**

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers ("Advertising Providers") that serve ads on our behalf and others' on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information that Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and products. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.

We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with this interest-based advertising activity. You may visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. For Canada please visit https://youradchoices.ca. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile product, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through the DAA tool. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if you use these tools, our Site may not function as intended.

We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes. We use Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes. For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use our website, visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.

**Transfer to Other Countries**

TMDB transfers, processes, and stores information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. Accordingly, some of your personal information may be used by us and our affiliates, subsidiaries and our suppliers who may be located in countries outside the country where you are located for the purposes outlined in this policy. The data protection laws in these countries may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you are located. Information collected within the European Economic Area (EEA) may, for example, be transferred and processed by third parties, located in a country outside of the EEA, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. Similarly, information collected within Canada may be transferred and processed by TMDB or third parties in a country outside of Canada. By providing your personal information to us you understand and expressly consent to TMDB and its business associates and suppliers processing your data in any jurisdiction, including without limitation the United States of America, in accordance with this privacy policy.

Individuals in the EEA and Canada and other states or countries may have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request access, seek to update, delete or correct this personal data.

**Data Protection Authority**

If you are a resident of the EEA and believe we maintain your personal data within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation, you may direct questions or complaints to privacy@xperi.com and direct such questions to TMDB's Data Controller. Subject to applicable law, you may (i) restrict TMDB's use of information that is your personal data, and (ii) lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. If the TMDB data protection officer for EMEA region is unable to help you, we suggest you refer to your local privacy regulator for help. For example, in the UK that would be the information commissioner's office at: https://ico.org.uk/.

**Children**

The TMDB products are not directed to children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information or personal data from children under 18. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personally identifiable information from a child under 18, we will take reasonable measures to remove that information from our records. If you are a parent of a child under age 18 and become aware that your child has provided personally identifiable information to TMDB, please contact us at privacy@xperi.com and you may request to exercise your applicable access, rectification, cancellation, and/or objection rights. If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and you wish to remove publicly available content, please contact us at privacy@xperi.com.

**How Long We Keep Your Information**

How long we retain your information depends on why we collected it, how we use it and legal regulations. We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes, to meet your request or for legal requirements. When no longer required, we will destroy, erase or de-personalize the information. Legal requirements may necessitate that we retain some or all of the personal information we hold for a period of time that is longer than we might otherwise hold it. You may ask that your personal data be deleted (see Deleting your Data above).

**Security of Your Information**

We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information, including appropriate technological, organizational and physical safeguards. We store personal information in electronic and physical files that are secure, and our security measures include secure on-site and off-site storage. We conduct audits and monitor compliance with our privacy practices.

However, due to the design of the Internet, ever-changing technology and other factors outside of our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties or that we will not be subject to security breaches. We will have no liability for disclosure of personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful acts of third parties.

You are responsible for the security of your username, ID and password for any of the TMDB products. Please take care when using and storing them.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy online on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). It is your responsibility to read this Privacy Policy carefully and review any changes that may have been made. Because changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page regularly.

**Questions**
