New Privacy Policy
==================

———-

**Effective Date: August 1st 2023**

The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of **Yopti, LLC d/b/a** SANESolution(“we” or “us”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the **\*.[sanesolution.com](https://sanesolution.com/)** website (the “Site”), and the ways in which we use this information.

This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

**How We Collect and Use Information**

We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). The Site Only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of our events, or have purchased one of our products. The Site collects personally identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for registration  or opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and credit card information when registering for our events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.

We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.

We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors and third-party publishers and advertisers for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.

Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party’s website and review its privacy policy.

We and/or Site Owners use cookies, Pixel Tags and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as your Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening emails or browsing websites. Such information is used to customize ads, deliver emails or content and may be shared with our Site Owners and 3rd party vendors.

The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site or by emailing messages to you through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information.

Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.

**Sharing with Third Parties**

As noted above, we use third party data sources to identify and provide contact information about visitors.  We may provide information to third party service providers that help us operate and manage our Site, process orders, provide advertising for us, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us, as well as process promotional and co-promotional communication. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services.

In addition to the sharing described elsewhere in this Policy, we may share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our organization.

**Google Analytics**

We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. Advertiser features include:

* Remarketing with Google Analytics
* Google Display Network Impression Reporting
* DoubleClick Platform integrations
* Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting

By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to notify our visitors by disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather data about your activities on our Site.  Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our check-out form but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order.  The “Remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our Site, and match the right audience with the right advertising message.

You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s ad settings and/or you may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**Facebook**

As advertisers on Facebook and through our Facebook page, we, (not Facebook) may collect content or information from a Facebook user and such information may be used in the same manner specified in this Privacy Policy. You consent to our collection of such information.

We abide by Facebook’s Data Use Restrictions.

* Any ad data collected, received or derived from our Facebook ad (“Facebook advertising data”) is only shared with someone acting on our behalf, such as our service provider. We are responsible for ensuring that our service providers protect any Facebook advertising data or any other information obtained from us, limit our use of all of that information, and keep it confidential and secure.
* We do not use Facebook advertising data for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling data across multiple advertisers’ campaigns, or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis (unless authorized by Facebook) and only to assess the performance and effectiveness of our Facebook advertising campaigns.
* We do not use Facebook advertising data, including the targeting criteria for a Facebook ad, to build, append to, edit, influence, or augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile device identifier or other unique identifier that identifies any particular user, browser, computer or device.
* We do not transfer any Facebook advertising data (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, ad exchange, data broker or other advertising or monetization related service.

**Retention: Third Party Pixels and Cookies**

When you visit our website, log in, register or open an email, cookies, ad beacons, and similar technologies may be used by our online data partners or vendors to associate these activities with information they or others have about you, including your email address. We (or service providers on our behalf) may then send communications and marketing to these email addresses. You may opt out of receiving this advertising by visiting https://app.retention.com/optout. This information can also be found here: https://retention.com/support/update-privacy-policy/

**General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR)**

The GDPR took effect on May 25, 2018, and is intended to protect the data of European Union (EU) citizens.

As a company that markets its site, content, products and/or services online we do not specifically target our marketing to the EU or conduct business in or to the EU in any meaningful way.

M. GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS OF SERVICE: Yopti makes no representation or warranty that the content and materials on the Sites are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States, its territories and possessions and Canada (excluding Quebec). Those who choose to access the Sites from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent applicable. Yopti reserves the right, at any time in our sole discretion, to limit the availability and accessibility of the Sites to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction we so desire. The SANESolution.com Site is not available or intended for use by residents of the province of Quebec, Canada.

You agree that Yopti, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account (in whole or in part), or use of the Sites, and remove and discard any content within the Sites, at any time and for any reason. You agree that any actions taken under this Paragraph may be effective without prior notice to you. In the event of termination, however, those portions of this Agreement that provide for continuing obligations on your part shall survive indefinitely.

O. INDEMNIFICATION: You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Yopti, and their parent and subsidiary companies and divisions, affiliates and respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and costs) arising out of or accruing from (a) any material posted or otherwise provided by you (including without limitation Submission Materials), or any other user of your account that infringes any intellectual property right of any person or entity or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, (b) any misrepresentation made by you in connection with your use of the Sites; and (c) any breach of any of the representation, warranties or other terms or conditions relating to use of your Submission Materials.

Yopti may assign its rights and interest in this Agreement or otherwise at any time and without notice to you or your consent.

Q. Binding Arbitration of All Disputes:

We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Sites, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with Yopti, or (iii) any Submission Materials or other data or information you may provide to Yopti or that Yopti may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, “Yopti Transactions or Relationships”), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the Sites, or engaging in any other Yopti Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.

We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. If those efforts fail, by using our the Sites, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against Yopti, and any claim that Yopti may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms and Conditions, our respective privacy policies, or any Yopti Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration”) administered by JAMS or its successor (“JAMS”) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the “Applicable Rules”). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the “AAA”) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the “Applicable Rules” in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, Yopti agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Paragraph 18, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below. Furthermore, this Section 4.Q shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You further agree that:

a) the Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and Yopti (the “Arbitrator”);

b) the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions and/or these arbitration provisions in Section 4.Q hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable;

c) the Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Yopti; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.

d) the Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of Washington consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with Washington or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;

e) the Arbitration can resolve only your and/or Yopti’s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;

f) the Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an “Award”). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;

g) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Yopti will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;

h) in the event you recover an Award greater than Yopti’s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award Yopti’s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but Yopti shall in all events bear their own respective attorneys’ fees; and

i) with the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Yopti shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.

j) Yopti may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after Yopti has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from Yopti Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.

k) Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against Yopti in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding

The failure of Yopti to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severed from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. No waiver by Yopti of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

Addendum 1 (Updated 6/27/2014)

Per the FTC rules, if we interview someone and they grab the bill for lunch, we would need to disclose this. Ditto if we use an Amazon link that gets us 8 cents instead of an Amazon link that gets us 0 cents. If someone gives us a comfy t-shirt with a logo and we wear it in a photo, same deal. Disclaimers all over the place. This would be tedious for us and even more tedious for readers. But rules are rules. To protect our families and preserve your reading experience, please assume that, for every link and product we use, the following all hold true, we were fed, paid, given products or services, or given stock.

We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.

By placing an order, you authorize SANE (or related) to charge the credit card / debit card you provided for your order. If your credit card is declined at the time you place your order, your order will not be accepted and you will be notified that your order payment has failed. Once your payment information is corrected, your order will be placed. If you have received an order without paying for it (e.g. your credit card was cancelled) SANE (or related) reserves the right to pursue any/all collection efforts allowed under the law.

**Autoship:**

By signing up for SANE (or related)’s Autoship Program you are abiding by the following Autoship Terms and Conditions:

**Autoship Account:**

You must have a SANE (or related) account, a valid email address and a Credit Card and/or Debit Card to set up and participate in the Autoship Program.  
By placing an Autoship order, whether by online or placing a telephone order through a SANE (or related) Sales Representative, facsimile, by mail, or otherwise, you are bound by these SANE (or related) Autoship Terms and Conditions.

**Autoship Order Placement:**

By placing an Autoship order, you authorize SANE (or related) to automatically place and ship you an order for your selected Autoship items, on a scheduled date determined by your order frequency selection on your initial Autoship order.

**Autoship Order Final Order Amount:**

Your Autoship Order final total may vary due to changes in price, tax rates, and/or shipping costs. Your order total will include:

Sales tax, if applicable, will be applied to each Autoship order.

Shipping cost, will be applied based on the shipping method you selected on your initial Autoship Order

**Autoship Order Payment:**

By placing an Autoship order, you authorize SANE (or related) to charge the credit card you provided for subsequent Autoship orders until you cancel your Autoship order. Unless modified by you, the credit card you used to set up the initial Autoship order will be charged for subsequent orders. Subsequent orders will be charged the day the order is placed and forwarded to the warehouse for processing.

If your credit card is declined at time of Autoship order placement, your order will not be placed and you will be notified that your Autoship payment has failed and you need to update your credit card information. Once your payment information is corrected, your Autoship order will be placed. To update your credit card information, you can go to your “My Account” section and click “Order History and Autoships” to update your credit card information.

Credit Card and Debit Card payment will be the only valid payment type accepted for Autoship Order payment. Store Credit, Gift Certificates, Checks, PayPal, and Bill Me Later will not be accepted.

If you have received an Autoship order without paying for it (e.g. your credit card was cancelled), SANE (or related) reserves the right to pursue any/all collection efforts allowed under the law.

**Autoship Order Notifications:**

A pre-order Autoship notification, Autoship order confirmation email and a shipment confirmation email will be sent after each Autoship order is processed and shipped. Once an Autoship order is scheduled, no emails will be sent before subsequent Autoship order shipments are processed.

At the time of order placement, any backordered item(s) on your Autoship order will be indicated on your order confirmation.

**Autoship Order Backordered Items:**

Any backordered Autoship order item(s) will be shipped as soon as they become available.

A backordered item will not affect the Autoship order schedule for the backordered item. Subsequent Autoship orders of that item will continue to be shipped according to the schedule you specified when you set up the initial Autoship order. 30, 60, or 90 day intervals will run from the date you set up the initial Autoship order, not from the date that an item was last shipped.

**Manufacture Container Size Changes on Autoship Orders**

Sometimes the manufacturer of a product will modify the container size of their product (for example, a manufacturer could change the size of their product from 30 capsules to 60 capsules). In this case, your Autoship order’s quantity and possibly ordered item(s) will be automatically adjusted to keep the same original order quantity. This new adjustment will continue unless you choose to cancel them.

**Product Formula Changes on Autoship Orders**

SANE (or related) is committed to providing the best quality and innovation. Our team is continually monitoring our product’s effectiveness and updates to the formula are always done in the name of quality and improvement of the product for what we believe is in the best interest of our customer.

This may result in the manufacturer slightly adjusting their formula of their product. Each formula change could be different and SANE (or related) will take the following actions dependent on the percentage change of the active ingredients:

For formula modifications, your order will be automatically updated by replacing the existing item with the new formula item. You will NOT be notified separately of this formula change before subsequent Autoship orders are processed and shipped. This new formula product will continue on subsequent Autoship orders unless you choose to remove this item from your Autoship Order.

**Cancellation of Autoship Orders:**

Canceling subsequent Autoship orders can be done by going to “My Account” section. You can modify or cancel your Autoship order at any time before the subsequent order is processed.  
Canceling an Autoship Order will stop all future shipments of that order.

Canceling an Autoship item will stop all future shipments of that item.

To resume your Autoship Order after you have cancelled it, you will need to create a new Autoship Order.

By placing an Autoship order, whether online, by placing a telephone order through a SANE (or related) Sales Representative, facsimile, by mail, or otherwise, you are agreeing to be bound by these SANE (or related) Autoship Terms and Conditions, as well as SANE (or related) general Terms and Conditions.

SANE (or related entities) reserves the right to update or revise these Autoship Terms and Conditions at any time. If SANE (or related) makes material changes to these Autoship Terms and Conditions, we will provide you notice by posting a notice on the website for 30 days.

Regardless, beginning December 1, 2009, the [FTC requires bloggers](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en) to disclose whenever there could be hidden interests or unspoken biases related to recommendations.  So here goes…

**First, the obvious:**  Yopti, LLC is a for profit company on a mission to improve the lives of as many people as possible through simple modern science and technology.

**Second, the less obvious:** Per the FTC rules, if we interview someone and they grab the bill for lunch, we would need to disclose this. Ditto if we use an Amazon link that gets us 8 cents instead of an Amazon link that gets us 0 cents. If someone gives us a comfy t-shirt with a logo and we wear it in a photo, same deal. Disclaimers all over the place. This would be tedious for us and even more tedious for readers. But rules is rules. To cover our butts 🙂 and preserve your reading experience, please assume that, for every link and product we use, we may earn a commission.
