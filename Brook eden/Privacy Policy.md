Brook Eden is a small, family-owned, sustainably managed vineyard and producer of elegant, true cool-climate wines.

To find our cellar door, you have to drive about a half hour north of Launceston, [turn down a country lane](https://brookeden.com.au/contact.html) off Pipers Brook Road, then come about 300m up our driveway, (avoiding the ducks and water hens on the way). I know it's tempting to take the first turnoff down Adams Road, but I recommend waiting to see our signs and head down Shortcut Road instead. It is called Shortcut Road for a reason...

This is Tasmania, so both the country drive and the end point are worth seeing.

At the cellar door you will most likely meet one of the owners. Ed and Annette are passionate about their wines, and are only too happy to talk about the vineyard, where good winemaking truly starts, or how our wines are made.

We'll offer you a tasting of our medal-winning wines. You can buy a single bottle or multiple cases, usually at cellar-door-only prices, we'll ship your wine anywhere in Australia, and you can enjoy a picnic, with a glass of our wine, in our garden or next to the vineyard.

If you are up for a bit of a walk, most days you'll spot one of the platypus who live in our wetland.
