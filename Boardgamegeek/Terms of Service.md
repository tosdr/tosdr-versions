You and BoardGameGeek are independent contractors, and the Terms of Service are not intended to create, and do not create, any agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer, or franchiser-franchisee relationship between you and BoardGameGeek.

BoardGameGeek has developed a web interface that enables game enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade games, learn, and interact with other game enthusiasts. Except for sales made through the Geek Store, sales and trades are between the merchant and the customer and not between BoardGameGeek and the customer. If you experience any issues or problems with an order you place through a store or any product you receive, you should address them with the merchant. BoardGameGeek is not responsible for any issues or problems you may have with the stuff you order from a third party or another user.

BoardGameGeek is not responsible if disputes arise between merchants, traders, or any other users. When you use our services, you release BoardGameGeek from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — related to disputes among merchants, traders, or any other users.

BoardGameGeek reserves the right to decide whether a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations such as, but not limited to, pornographic, obscene, or defamatory material. BoardGameGeek may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a user's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion. Accounts and the personal information we possess about you will be deleted in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://boardgamegeek.com/privacy). If you have had your account terminated for cause, you are not permitted to create a new account.

### A. Think there is infringing content on BoardGameGeek?

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent designated below with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further detail):

(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;  
(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;  
(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;  
(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;  
(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and  
(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

The designated Copyright Agent of BoardGameGeek, LLC for receipt of notifications of claimed infringement is: Scott Alden; e-mail: dmca@geekdo.com (subject line: "DMCA Takedown Request"); 6 Bretton Creek Court, Dallas, TX 75220.

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the above requirements, your DMCA Takedown Request may not be valid.

### B.Was your content improperly removed because of a DMCA report?

If you believe that your user submission or other content, which was removed (or to which access was disabled) pursuant to the above provision, is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your user submission, then you may send a counter notification to the Copyright Agent at dmca@geekdo.com (subject line: "DMCA Counter Notification"), containing the following information:

BoardGameGeek reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with BoardGameGeek’s defense of such claim. In any case, you may not settle any third-party claim against us unless we consent to such settlement.

This defense and indemnification obligation survives these Terms of Service and your use of the Geek Websites.  

15\. YOU AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND BOARDGAMEGEEK WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH MANDATORY ARBITRATION IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND NOT BY A COURT OR BY A JURY.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A. You will resolve claims with an arbitrator

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Terms of Service, your or your authorized user’s relationship with BoardGameGeek, or your or your authorized user’s use of our services (collectively referred to as a **“claim”**) will be resolved **exclusively by final and binding arbitration, rather than by a court or a jury. The only exception to such mandatory arbitration is that you are NOT prohibited from resolving any such dispute or claim as an individual claim in a small claims court.** The exclusive venue for the arbitration shall be Dallas County, Texas.  
  
**There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.** However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the Terms of Service as a court would.

### B. You are waiving your right to a jury trial.

If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration **we each waive any right to a jury trial. You acknowledge that you make this jury waiver knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly.**

### C. You will arbitrate under certain laws and rules.

This arbitration provision is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitration, and any appeal, shall be governed by the substantive law of the State of Texas and the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association **(“AAA”)**.  
If, for any reason, the arbitration or appeal cannot be conducted before AAA or pursuant to AAA rules, and the parties cannot agree to an alternative arbitration service or rules, any court of competent jurisdiction in Dallas County, Texas, may appoint an arbitrator or select appropriate arbitration rules to govern the arbitration or appeal.

### D. The fees and costs can be split in different ways.

Each party shall pay an equal share of the arbitrator(s)’ fees and costs relating to the arbitration, subject to the arbitrator(s)’ authority to reallocate such fees and costs in his or her discretion. In any event, each party shall be responsible for payment of their own attorney’s fees and legal costs.

### E. Either of us can try to bring a temporary injunction against the other.

Either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in federal or state court in Dallas County, Texas, exclusively, at any time until the selection of the arbitrator(s) is completed. Once the selection of the arbitrator(s) is completed, the arbitrator(s) shall assume responsibility for any further action or rulings with respect to any such temporary injunction action. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts of Dallas County, Texas, solely for the purpose of any such temporary injunction action.

### F. You are waiving your right to bring a claim against us as part of a class-action lawsuit.

**We each agree that any dispute, whether arbitrated or brought in small claims court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.** Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each party agrees to pursue its claims on an individual basis and not to (1) join its claims with any other person or entity’s claims, (2) pursue any claim as a representative of a class, as a private attorney general or in any representative capacity, or (3) participate in a class or collective action or mass action with respect to any claim. It is the express intent of the parties that the arbitrator, or, as applicable, small claims court, shall not have the power to award class or collective relief or to determine or order that the dispute should proceed as a class or collective action, whether in arbitration or in any other forum or venue. The parties understand and acknowledge that by entering into this provision, **we each are waiving our respective rights to have a court or jury adjudicate our claims.**

### G. You elect to use certain appellate rules.

The parties adopt and agree to implement the AAA Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules with respect to any award subject to this arbitration provision. Written notice of appeal shall be provided to the opposing party and the arbitration service and shall comply with the requirements of the AAA Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules or such other arbitration appellate rules to which the parties may agree or which a court may designate pursuant to the process described earlier in this Section.

16\. You can’t assign your rights under these Terms of Service, but we can.

18\. Everything that you and BoardGameGeek have agreed on is contained in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

19\. Waiver
-----------

No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and BoardGameGeek's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

20\. If a court finds part of the Terms of Service invalid, it won’t invalidate the whole of the Terms of Service.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any term or provision of these Terms of Service is held void, invalid, inoperative, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then no other term or provision will be consequently affected, and the remaining terms and provisions will remain in full force and effect.
