**User Submissions**. We do not want to receive confidential or proprietary information through your use of the Services, except to the extent expressly provided for under applicable Additional Terms. Subject to such Additional Terms, any material, information, or other communication that you transmit, post or upload to or through the Services (“Communications”) will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, and you agree that we (a) will be under no obligation of any kind with respect to such information, (b) may reproduce, make derivative works from, use, disclose, and distribute the Communications to others without limitation or compensation, and (c) at our sole election, may attribute authorship of Communications to you by listing your name.

**General**. The Council is based in the United States. We make no claims that any information or content accessible through the Services is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to such information or content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Services from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. These Terms are governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding Delaware’s conflicts of laws provisions. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms. A party may give notice to the other party only in writing at that party’s principal place of business, attention of that party’s principal legal officer, or at such other address or by such other method as the party shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The failure of the Council to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Services must be brought in the state or federal courts of the State of California, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of the Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. The waiver of a breach of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

We do not control such sites and, therefore, is not responsible for any content posted on such sites. The fact that we offer links to such sites should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of those sites, their content or the companies or products referenced therein. If you decide to access any third party sites linked to from the Services, you do this entirely at your own risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, you agree that the Council is not liable or responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third party sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against the Council with respect to such sites or the content thereof.
