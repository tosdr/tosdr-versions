* personal data is always adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed; 
* accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.  

**PURPOSES OF PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA**

We may process your personal data for a number of different purposes. For each purpose, we must have a legal ground for such processing. 

Generally, such legal grounds are as follows:

* you have given us explicit consent to the processing of your personal data;
* processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are the party or in cases you requested us to process your prior to entering into a contract; 
* processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligation to which we are the subject;

**What do we mean when we say “Legitimate Interest” and “Performance of contract”?**

Legitimate Interest shall mean our interest as a business in conducting and managing. We hereby confirm that we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

**DISCLOSURE**

We do not disclose your personal data to any third parties. However, we may disclose your personal data if such disclosure is required or permitted by law.  In some cases, personal data may be shared with certain third-party service providers as well as between our internal departments (engineering, analytics, legal, customer and marketing, etc.) for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. 

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

If you are EU/EEA citizen or resident please be aware that we and some of our third parties are based outside the EU/EEA which means that the processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EU/EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU/EEA, we ensure that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

* we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
* where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the EU;
* where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they ensure a high level of personal data protection.

If there is neither adequacy decision nor appropriate safeguards implemented we still may transfer your personal data out of the EU due to the following justifications:

* we have been informed you about the possible risks of transfers of your personal data and you has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer of your personal data out of the EU;      
* the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract concluded between you and us or if you requested us to perform pre-contractual measures; 
* the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded between us and other natural or legal person for your benefit; 
* the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest; 
* the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; 
* the transfer is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or interests of other persons in cases where you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent;
