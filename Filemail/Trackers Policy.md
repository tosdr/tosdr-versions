What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small text files stored physically on the device which you use to browse Filemail website (be it a PC, tablet or mobile phone). Cookies created by Filemail can be accessed only by Filemail servers - no other service will have access to them, that's one of the basic security rules built into every browser.

What are cookies used for?
--------------------------

Cookies are used to store identifiers and other information which allows Filemail to work securely and reliably for you. With cookies we are able to provide mechanisms such as:

* authentication of users - once you log in, a cookie will allow us to keep you logged in during your browser session.
    
* localization - cookies are one way of setting the language in which Filemail website is displayed.
    
* site features and services - some features settings are remembered in cookies - you make your choice once and we won't ask for it again.
    
* security - we sometimes use cookies to determine illegal repeated attempts of people guessing passwords, or sending extreme amounts of messages (which usually are spam).
