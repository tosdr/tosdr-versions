**How we use or disclose information**
--------------------------------------

We must use and disclose your health information to provide that information:

* To you or someone who has the legal right to act for you (your personal representative) in order to administer your rights as described in this notice; and
* To the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, if necessary, to make sure your privacy is protected.

We have the right to use and disclose health information for your treatment, to pay for your healthcare and to operate our business. For example, we may use or disclose your health information:

**For Payment** of premiums due to us, to determine your coverage, and to process claims for healthcare services you receive, including for subrogation or coordination of other benefits you may have. For example, we may tell a doctor whether you are eligible for coverage and what percentage of the bill may be covered.

**For Treatment.** We may use or disclose health information to aid in your treatment or the coordination of your care. For example, we may disclose information to your physicians or hospitals to help them provide medical care to you.

**For Healthcare Operations.** We may use or disclose health information as necessary to operate and manage our business activities related to providing and managing your healthcare coverage. For example, we might talk to your physician to suggest a disease management or wellness program that could help improve your health or we may analyze data to determine how we can improve our services. We may use or disclose health information when the use or disclosure is in the form of face-to-face communication made by a covered entity to an individual or a promotional gift of nominal value provided by the covered entity. We may use or disclose health information to participants in the organized health care arrangement for any healthcare operations activities of the organized healthcare arrangement.

In addition, we may share other health information with the plan sponsor for plan administration purposes if the plan sponsor agrees to special restrictions on its use and disclosure of the information in accordance with federal law.

**For Underwriting Purposes.** We may use or disclose your health information for underwriting purposes; however, we will not use or disclose your genetic information for such purposes.

**As Required by Law.** We may disclose information when required to do so by law.

**To Persons Involved with Your Care.** We may use or disclose your health information to a person involved in your care or who helps pay for your care, such as a family member, when you are incapacitated or in an emergency, or when you agree or fail to object when given the opportunity. If you are unavailable or unable to object, we will use our best judgment to decide if the disclosure is in your best interests. Special rules apply regarding when we may disclose health information to family members and others involved in a deceased individual’s care. We may disclose health information to any persons involved, prior to the death, in the care or payment for care of a deceased individual, unless we are aware that doing so would be inconsistent with a preference previously expressed by the deceased.

**To Business Associates** that perform functions on our behalf or provide us with services if the information is necessary for such functions or services. Our business associates are required, under contract with us and pursuant to federal law, to protect the privacy of your information and are not allowed to use or disclose any information other than as specified in our contract and as permitted by federal law.

**Additional Restrictions on Use and Disclosure.** Certain federal and state laws may require special privacy protections that restrict the use and disclosure of certain health information, including highly confidential information about you. “Highly confidential information” may include confidential information under Federal laws governing alcohol and drug abuse information and genetic information, as well as state laws that often protect the following types of information:

This includes, except for limited circumstances allowed by federal privacy law, not using or disclosing psychotherapy notes about you, selling your health information to others, or using or disclosing your health information for certain promotional communications that are prohibited marketing communications under federal law, without your written authorization. Once you give us authorization to release your health information, we cannot guarantee that the recipient to whom the information is provided will not disclose the information. You may take back or “revoke” your written authorization at any time in writing, except if we have already acted based on your authorization.
