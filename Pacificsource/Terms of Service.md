### **Online privacy and security**

At PacificSource, protecting your personal information is important to us. We are as committed to protecting the information you provide through this Website as when you provide it to us over the phone, in person, or through the mail. However, we recognize, and want you to recognize, that while electronic communications have many benefits, they are not as secure as other means of communication. Please read the following information carefully to better understand how using this Site affects your privacy.

### **Security practices**

We attempt to protect online information according to applicable laws and established company security standards and practices. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control, and we continually evaluate new technologies for safeguarding your information. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of electronic transmissions via the Internet because these transmissions may potentially use insecure computers and links, and data may be lost or intercepted by unauthorized parties during such transmission. If you wish to submit personal or confidential information by a more secure means of communication, please contact us.

The information you provide to us online is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL is the leading security protocol for data transfer on the Internet. This technology scrambles your account information as it moves between your computer’s browser and our computer systems. When information is scrambled, or encrypted in this way, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone other than PacificSource to read it. This secure session helps protect the safety and confidentiality of your information when you interact with us online.

### **Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that our system sends to your computer to collect information about your activities on this Site. The cookie transmits this information back to this Site each time your browser requests a page from this Site, and the information is stored to help facilitate your use of this Site the next time you visit. In addition to information you provide, we may use cookies or other passive means to collect general information such as: the name of the domain and host computer from which you access the Internet; the IP address of the computer you are using; the browser and operating system you are using; the date and time you access this Site; and the Internet address of the Website from which you linked to this Site. We use cookies so you won't have to reenter information each time you visit this Site. If you do not want to receive cookies from this Site, you can set your browser to not accept cookies.

### **Use of email communication**

Please use your own best judgment when sending information via the Internet to an email address. Emails sent via the Internet may pass through private and public networks with varying levels of security. Some networks may have taken steps to secure email transmissions while others have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity of an email’s content. An email may be copied, altered, or destroyed.

If you contact PacificSource by email, once your email is received, we preserve the content of your email, your email address and our response, so we can efficiently respond to your questions and meet legal and regulatory requirements.

### **Use of email address when you register for an account**

If you register for an online user account with PacificSource, you will be required to supply a valid email address and agree to the Website Portals Usage Agreement. By registering for an account, and voluntarily submitting your email address, you are agreeing that PacificSource may use your email address in the following ways: (1) as a piece of identifying information which may be used to authenticate your identity, (2) to correspond with you and provide you information about your account, and (3) to send you other health insurance messages, including messages related to your coverage, as PacificSource deems reasonable and/or necessary.
