**INDEMNIFICATION**  
You shall indemnify and hold Ad Council Entities harmless from and against any damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to demands, claims or actions brought as a result of or in connection with any breach or violation of these Terms by you or by your dependent or any claims arising from your Posts or any other information provided to Ad Council or the Websites. We have the right, at our expense, to assume exclusive defense against any Claim and all negotiations for settlement and you agree to cooperate with us in the defense of any such Claim, at our request.

**WHAT LAW APPLIES?**  
Our Terms shall be construed and enforced under the laws of the State of New York applicable to parties resident in and contracts made, executed and wholly performed within the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. You specifically agree and submit to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal Courts situated in the State, City and County of New York and you will not object to jurisdiction or venue on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, inconvenient forum or otherwise. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to our Terms. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY NOW HAVE OR HEREAFTER POSSESS TO A TRIAL BY JURY. YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THIS WEBSITE AND/OR THESE TERMS, WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION.

**MISCELLANEOUS**  
Our Terms can only be modified by us. The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any term or condition is severable and shall not affect the rest of the Terms. Both you and Ad Council acknowledge and agree that no partnership is formed and neither you nor Ad Council has the power or the authority to obligate or bind the other. Any delay in enforcing or any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of any other or subsequent breach of these Terms. Headings are purely for reference and shall not affect the meaning of any term or condition. We may receive personal information about you in connection with the Website. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully since it describes, among other things, how we collect and use information from you when you use our Websites. No claim or action relating in any way to these Terms, including our Privacy Policy, our Websites, Content or otherwise with respect to the subject matter, regardless of form or the basis of the claim, may be brought by you more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen (or if multiple causes, from the date the first such cause of action arose).
