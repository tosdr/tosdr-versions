ABOUT US
--------

Rebrandly is a private company limited by shares and registered in Ireland (Company Number 567282) having its registered office address at Block 3, Harcourt Centre, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2, D02 A339, Ireland. Rebrandly is the data controller of personal data collected from residents of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom who are users of our services. This applies when you create a Rebrandly link (a "User"). In these circumstances we are acting as a controller of your data. When you click on a Rebrandly link created by a User, we are acting as a processor and the relevant User is acting as a Controller. The relevant User is responsible for their own compliance with applicable data protection legislation in these circumstances.

PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
------------------------

We collect personal data from you through your use of the Site and Services. Personal data is information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual. We collect the following types of personal data.

We also collect data as a processor on behalf of our Users. This data is typically collected automatically whenever a Rebrandly link is clicked on or used. This data is often not considered personal data however in the interests of transparency we have included information on this data below.

PERSONAL DATA AS YOU NAVIGATE OUR SITE OR REBRANDLY LINKS
---------------------------------------------------------

We automatically collect certain personal data through your use of our Site and our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, such as the following:

* _Technical Data:_ technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, authentication information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, how often you use the Site and other performance data.

* _Usage Data:_ information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL), clickstream to, through and from our Site (including date and time), products you viewed or searched for, page response times, length of visits to certain pages, and methods used to browse away from the page.

We use this information on behalf of Users to assist them in understanding basic facts regarding the data subjects that are using their links, how they should interact with data subjects and in order to create better experiences/enhance business performance. Please note that Rebrandly receives the IP address of individuals that click on the links. At this point, the country of origin is extracted from the IP address. The IP address is immediately programmatically hashed. The described hashing process creates a unique identifier which is not identifiable as an IP address. The full IP address is not used or visible to Rebrandly or its Users. We do not collect other personal data and so the individual that clicks on the link is not identifiable.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
-----------------------

We operate internationally and we may transfer information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy to our trusted partners and service providers who maintain their servers outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including the United States. The United States may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. Your personal data can be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to the laws of the United States.

For any transfers of personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom that we make to other entities as described in this Privacy Policy, we use appropriate safeguards to ensure for the lawful processing and transfer of the personal data, including, when appropriate, the use of [standard contractual clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) approved by the European Commission. To obtain a copy of the safeguards, contact us at [www.rebrandly.support/contact](https://rebrandly.support/contact).

SECURITY MEASURES
-----------------

We have put in place appropriate security measures to protect the personal data we collect from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
----------------------

Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, the Site does not currently interpret, respond to, or alter its practices when it receives “Do Not Track” signals.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
------------------

The Site and Services are not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal data from children 16.

YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND YOUR RIGHTS – EUROPE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM ONLY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are in a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom, you are entitled to the following explanation of the legal bases we rely on to process your personal data and a description of your privacy rights.

Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Data

The legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

#### Consent

We may process your personal data based on your consent such as when you create an account or when you ask us to send certain kinds of marketing communications. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

#### Our Legitimate Interests

We may process your personal data if doing so is necessary for our legitimate interests and your rights as an individual do not override those legitimate interests, where we do this we carry out a legitimate interest assessment. For example, when we process your personal data to carry out fraud prevention activities and activities to increase network and information security, to market directly to you, to expand our business activities, and to improve our services and the content and functionality of our Site.

#### To Perform a Contract

We may process your personal data to administer and fulfill contractual obligations to you or our Users.

Your Rights
-----------

#### Access Your Personal Data

You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not we are processing personal data about you and, if so, the right to be provided with the information contained in this Privacy Policy. You also have the right to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you. Any such request should be submitted to us in writing to [www.rebrandly.support/contact](https://rebrandly.support/contact). Registered users may also log onto their dashboard, click on their account settings, click on the “Request GDPR SAR Report” button and follow the instructions provided. We will need to verify your identity in such circumstances and may request more information or clarifications from you if needed to help us locate and provide you with the personal data requested.

#### Restrict Our Use of Your Personal Data

You have the right to ask us to restrict from processing your personal data in any of the following circumstances:

* You have contested the accuracy of the personal data we hold on record in relation to you or for a period of time to enable us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;

* The processing of your personal data is unlawful and you request the restriction of use of the personal data instead of its erasure;

* We no longer require your personal data for the purpose of processing but you require this data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or

* Where you have contested the processing pending the verification of our legitimate grounds.

#### Rectify Your Personal Data

You have the right to ask us to rectify any inaccurate personal data about you and to have incomplete personal data completed.

#### Delete Your Personal Data

You can ask us to delete your personal data if:

* It is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected it;

* We have been using it with no valid legal basis;

* We are obligated to erase it to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject;

* We need your consent to use the information and you withdraw consent; or

* You object to us processing your personal data where our legal basis for doing so is our legitimate interests and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.

However, this right is not absolute. Even if you make a request for deletion, we may need to retain certain information to comply with a legal obligation or for administrative purposes, such as record keeping, maintenance of opt-out requirements, defending or making legal claims, or detecting fraudulent activities. We will retain information in accordance with the “HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA” section above.

If you do exercise a valid right to have your personal data deleted, please keep in mind that deletion by third parties to whom the information has been provided might not be immediate and that the deleted information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period (but will not be available to others).

#### Object to Our Use of Your Personal Data

You have the right to object to our use of your personal data where our reason for using it is based on our legitimate interests or your consent (rather than when the reason for using it is to perform an obligation due to you under a contract with us).

#### Transfer Your Personal Data to Another Service Provider

You have the right to request from us a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to request that we transmit your personal data in this format to another controller. This applies to personal data we are processing based on your consent or required for the performance of a contract between us.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the “QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS” section below

#### Make a Complaint

If you have any concerns or complaints regarding our processing of your Personal Data, please contact us as described in the “QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS” section below and we will do our best to answer any question and resolve any complaint to your satisfaction.
