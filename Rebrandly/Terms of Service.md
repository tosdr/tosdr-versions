3.FEES, PAYMENT, BILLING
------------------------

Subscription Fees
-----------------

To access certain Services, you will be required to purchase a subscription which entitles you and any employees, agents, clients, and independent contractors who you authorize ("Authorized Users") to access and use the Services and Documentation (as defined in Section 4) ("User Subscription"). Except for free accounts, you must pay subscription fees in the manner set out in the “Subscription” and “Payment Method” sections of your Rebrandly [dashboard](https://app.rebrandly.com/) ("Subscription Fees"). All Subscription Fees are payable by you to Rebrandly up-front, in-full and in advance for the full contract term and without any deduction (e.g. bank fees, exchange rates), set-off or withholding whatsoever (save for as required by law). We will charge the Subscription Fees to your payment method on the specific payment date provided on the “Subscription” and “Payment Method” sections of your Rebrandly [dashboard](https://app.rebrandly.com/). If Rebrandly does not receive your payment within five (5) days after the due date, Rebrandly is entitled to suspend your access to all or part of the Services until you reinstate your subscription and while the invoice(s) concerned remain unpaid.

The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of User Subscription you choose when you sign up for the Service. In some cases, your payment date may change. For example, if you change your User Subscription or if your User Subscription began on a day that is not in every month.

Renewal
-------

Your User Subscription will automatically renew at the end of your subscription (as identified at the time of purchase, in your [dashboard](https://app.rebrandly.com/) or in the relevant order form) ("Anniversary Date") unless you cancel your User Subscription in accordance with the next Cancellation section. For sake of clarity and by way of example only, if your subscription is a two year initial term payable annually, your “Anniversary Date” is the second anniversary of the start date. If Rebrandly has not received a notice of cancellation and has not received payment of fees due for the renewal period by the Anniversary Date, Rebrandly may suspend, delete, or downgrade your Services to a free service. Rebrandly may delete any data that you have provided in your links and dashboard without notice in such circumstances.

Cancellation
------------

"Activation Date" means the date on which Rebrandly makes the Services available to you. At any time after the Activation Date, you may cancel your User Subscription to a Service by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice to Rebrandly or by turning off auto-renewal in your [dashboard](https://app.rebrandly.com/). Rebrandly may cancel your access to and use of a Service, or discontinue any Service in its sole discretion at any time by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice. The Service will terminate automatically on the date specified in the cancellation notice. If the Party does not specify a cancellation date, the Service will terminate on the next Anniversary Date. If you cancel a Service prior to the Anniversary Date, you will not be entitled to any refund and all unpaid Subscription Fees shall become immediately due and payable.

If for any reason Rebrandly cancels a Service or is no longer able to continue a Service, you will be entitled to a refund of Subscription Fees already paid, calculated pro rata, for the unexpired period of the User Subscription. In any case, a refund will not amount to more than the Subscription Fees you already paid.

Rebrandly reserves the right to cancel any Service immediately and without notice to you if you breach any provision of these Terms of Use or any other terms that apply to that Service.

Upon cancellation for any reason: (i) all rights granted to you under these Terms of Use will cease; (ii) you must cease all activities authorized by these Terms of Use; and (iii) you must immediately delete, remove, and cease access to your user account.

Payment Methods
---------------

To use our Services, you must provide one or more payment methods. You authorize us to charge any payment method associated with your account. We may charge a different payment method in circumstances where your primary payment method is declined or no longer available to us. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise within five (5) days of the initial charge, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend or downgrade access to all or part of the Services. We will have no obligation to provide any or all of the Services while the invoice concerned remains unpaid. For some payment methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your payment method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the payment method you use. We recommend checking with your payment method provider for details. Payment by check is not accepted.

Updating Your Payment Methods
-----------------------------

You can update your payment methods in your [Dashboard](https://app.rebrandly.com/). We may also update your payment methods using the information provided to us by authorized payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge your payment methods.

Usage and Volume Fees
---------------------

"Usage Volume" means the volumes set out in your User Subscription (including but not limited to number of clicks, links, domain names, reports, API calls and teammates). If you exceed your Usage Volume, we reserve the right to charge you additional fees.

Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans
-------------------------------------------

Rebrandly may change the price of its Services at any time by updating the applicable pricing information or other terms posted on the Site. Any price changes will become effective beginning with the first full billing cycle after Rebrandly posts any such changes. If you do not agree to any such changes, you must cancel your User Subscription before the change takes effect, otherwise, it will be deemed that you have accepted and agreed to the changes.

Upon any upgrade or purchase, you agree to pay the increased Subscription Fees in accordance with these Terms of Use.

Some Services (such as professional services) may incur additional fees outside your User Subscription. You will pay any such additional fees in the manner mutually agreed upon before commencement of the Services.

Taxes
-----

You shall be responsible for all sales, use and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state or local governmental entity on any amounts payable hereunder; and to the extent Rebrandly is required to pay any such sales, use, excise, or other taxes or other duties or charges, you shall reimburse Rebrandly in connection with its payment of fees and expenses as set forth in this Section. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall Rebrandly pay or be responsible for any taxes imposed on, or regarding, your income, revenues, gross receipts, personnel, or real or personal property or other assets. To the extent you are required by law to deduct and withhold any taxes on amounts payable under this Agreement, you shall: (a) pay Rebrandly such additional amounts so as to ensure that Rebrandly receives the same total amount that we would have received if no such withholding tax had been required; (b) promptly deduct and remit such tax due to the appropriate tax authority; and (c) provide Rebrandly with all such reasonable assistance and documents necessary for Rebrandly to receive a tax credit for a corresponding amount.
