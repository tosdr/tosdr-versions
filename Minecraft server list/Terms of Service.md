* Do you manipulate your server data to enhance players online value or similar.
* If you find your servers is getting deleted by an admin, it is because you are breaking the rules somehow – work harder on your submission to avoid this. If this happends to much, we will end up blocking the IP from future advertisment on the website.
* You must make an english description – it is ok to include a local language description below if the server it meant for a specific nationality.
