General
-------

Micro-data is a term that applies to short strings of data that are critical to end users (e.g. website logins, passwords, social security numbers, bank account numbers, access codes, pin codes and private notes). Files may include private documents, personal photos and videos. Keeper utilizes strong encryption using a 256-bit cipher and is approved for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security under license #5D992. Keeper is herein referred to as "Keeper", "System" or "Software".

Responsibilities & Restrictions
-------------------------------

Keeper software is used by millions of people globally to protect and store their passwords and private information. The Software may only be used for lawful purposes and as accordingly, you agree to not misuse Keeper. When using the Software, you agree:  
  
Not to upload, post, email or transmit otherwise any material that contains software viruses, trojan horses, worms, files or programs intended to interrupt, destroy, deface or limit the use, access or functionality of the Software.  
  
Not to upload, post, email or transmit otherwise any material that is illegal, pornographic, abusive or obscene.  
  
Not to upload, post, email or transmit otherwise any material that violates the privacy or intellectual property rights of others.  
  
Not to "Reverse Engineer", change, modify, hack, translate, copy, distribute, pledge, assign, transfer, make derivative works, exploit, encumber or crack any portion of the Software.  
  
Unless you are an authorized reseller of the Software, you may not display, copy, reproduce, license or distribute the Software, any component thereof, any documentation provided in connection with the Software, or any content, including but not limited to newsletters distributed to you by Keeper Security in connection with the Software.  
  
Keeper Security, in its sole discretion, may remove content and block user access to any content that it determines to be illegal, threatening, pornographic, abusive, obscene or in violation of another party's intellectual property.

Your Master Password
--------------------

You hereby understand that upon using the Software, you will be required to create a "Master Password." The Master Password will be used by you and only you.  
  
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Master Password and Keeper records entered, imported and exported using the Software. Keeper Security has no knowledge of your Master Password and will not ask or be permitted to ask for your Master Password. Keeper Security, will not under any circumstances, have access to your Master Password or the records stored in Keeper.

Keeper Security shall not be responsible for the actions of any individuals who misuse or misappropriate your Keeper information or other any of your assets using your Master Password or the information stored in Keeper.  
  
Please remember your Master Password. If you lose or forget your Master Password, Keeper Security will not be able to assist you in gaining access to your records since Keeper Security does not have access to or knowledge of your Master Password. Again, it is imperative to not forget your Master Password since this is required to gain access to your records stored in Keeper.

Maintenance of Your Keeper Records
----------------------------------

Micro-data and files stored in your Keeper vault are referred to as "Keeper Records." Keeper Security will maintain an encrypted binary file of your Keeper records on Keeper Security's Cloud Security Vault™, provided that you are a paid-subscriber of the Software. The binary is created when you backup your records and is stored in the event that you need to recover your information due to local system crash, damage, loss or hack attempt that results in the self-destruction of your records. The Cloud Security Vault is also used to enable seamless synchronization of your records on your devices where Keeper is installed.

If your subscription expires and you choose not to renew your subscription within 90 days, Keeper Security reserves the right to delete any Keeper records contained in your account that have files (e.g. documents, photos, videos, etc.) contained in them. Notice will be sent to you prior to termination based on the email address associated with your Keeper account. Expired user accounts convert to a Free User account.

A Free User of the software is permitted to use Keeper on one mobile device without the ability to backup, restore, share or save their records outside of the one mobile device. If the device or data is lost or stolen, a Free User will not be able to restore their records.

Free User accounts are allowed to create and store ten (10) records in their Keeper vault. After this record limit, a Free User will be required to purchase a paid Keeper plan (such as Unlimited, Family, Business or Enterprise).

Free User accounts are allowed to have up to two (2) vault records that contain Two-Factor TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passcodes) codes. To use more Two-Factor codes within vault records a Free User will be required to purchase a paid Keeper plan (such as Unlimited, Family, Business, or Enterprise).

Free User accounts are allowed to upload and store five (5) files in their Keeper vault subject to a maximum storage size of 100MB. After this file limit, a Free User will be required to purchase a paid storage plan.

If you are a free user who has not utilized the Software within 12 months, Keeper Security reserves the right to terminate and delete your account. Notice will be sent to you prior to termination based on the email address associated with your Keeper account.

All users of the Software are required to adopt and maintain the Privacy Policy, which may be modified by Keeper Security from time to time.

Violation of these responsibilities and restrictions may result in the termination of this Agreement.

The Fee Schedule, including subscription quantities and pricing, is subject to change at any time in Keeper Security's sole discretion. Keeper Security will use good-faith efforts to notify you via email prior to effectuating any change to the Fee Schedule.

In the event that you provide us with a debit card number instead of a credit card number, you authorize us to make all charges described in this Agreement to your debit card account. If the annual payment option is selected or if you have previously provided your Charge Card for payment, you hereby authorize Keeper Security to charge your card for such amounts on a regular monthly or annual basis at the beginning of each billing cycle. If Keeper Security is for any reason unable to effect automatic payment via your Charge Card, Keeper Security will attempt to notify you via email and your Keeper account will be disabled until payment is received.

You may upgrade your account at any time. If you are upgrading your subscription you will only be charged for the remainder of your annual subscription. The full amount of the new plan will be charged annually thereafter. You agree to pay all fees, taxes and charges incurred in connection with your Keeper subscription at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. A standard annual billing cycle is 365 days.

The encrypted binary file is used to create a real-time backup of your chat messages (including any file attachments) and is stored in the event that you need to recover your information due to local system crash or if your device(s) is damaged, lost or replaced. The encrypted backup is also important in the event of a hack attempt that results in the self-destruction of your KeeperChat messages. The Cloud Security Vault is also used to enable seamless synchronization of your chat messages on your devices where KeeperChat is installed.  
  
If your subscription expires and you choose not to renew your subscription based on the terms contained herein, Keeper Security reserves the right to delete any KeeperChat messages contained in your account that have files (e.g. documents, photos, videos, etc.) contained in them.

Violation of these responsibilities and restrictions may result in the termination of this Agreement.
