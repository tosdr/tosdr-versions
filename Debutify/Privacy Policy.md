Introduction
------------

With the advent of new communication tools, it is necessary to pay particular attention to the protection of privacy. That is why we, Debutify Inc. (hereinafter “Debutify”), are seriously concerned about your personal information's privacy and are committed to respecting the information we collect.

Debutify undertakes to respect, in accordance with applicable laws, the obligations regarding the collection and processing of personal and confidential information obtained in the context of the operation of a company so that everyone can benefit from the respect of their private life.

The hereby privacy policy (hereinafter the “Policy”) describes the information that Debutify may collect from the user, that is to say, the end-user or the organization you represent or you work for (hereinafter the “User” or “Users”), in connection with its activities, the purposes for which Debutify collects it, the use it makes of it, and the circumstances under which it can pass them on to third parties. In addition, this Policy indicates the User’s rights regarding the collection, use and communication of its personal information. Debutify agrees not to collect, use or disclose the User’s personal information otherwise than in accordance with this Policy and applicable laws in the United States.

Scope of the policy
-------------------

When the User browses Debutify’s website (hereinafter the “Website”), he agrees to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If the User continues to use the Website after a new version of this Policy has been posted here, he consents to and will be bound by the changes.

The information we collect is necessary when we provide the User with a service that he has requested. By providing us with this information, the User consents to its collection and use as defined in this Policy.

Collection of personal information
----------------------------------

Debutify may obtain personal information from the User when he saves his personal information on the Website, or where appropriate, when he discloses this personal information otherwise, such as creating a User account and choosing a password, by logging in as a registered User to the Website, by launching a product search, by requesting a service, by providing information in the account, by contacting us by phone, email or otherwise, or by completing a form to enter a contest, inventory request, promotion or survey.

Do we collect information from minors?
--------------------------------------

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under the age 18, please contact us at [www.debutify.com](https://debutify.com/)

We collect the following User information upon registration:

* The surname and first name;
* The age;
* The gender;
* The telephone number;
* The personal address;
* The email address;
* The bank information;
* The professional address;
* Website

How can you review, update, or delete data we collect from you?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the laws of some countries, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, change that information, or delete it in some circumstances. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please submit a request by contacting us. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

How long do we keep your information?
-------------------------------------

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us to keep your personal information for longer than 7 years.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Forms and information
---------------------

The User’s personal information may be collected through forms, namely:

* Registration on the website form;
* Order form;
* Update the user's profile form;
* Authorization of the User to access his information; and
* Contact form.

Debutify also uses cookies, as indicated in the “Automatically Exchanged Data” section. Debutify may also keep a record of the User’s product interests and obtain his information from divisions or current or future companies belonging to Debutify.

Debutify may use the User’s personal information to stay in contact with the User and provide him with a personalized service at all times.

If the User has not subscribed to our newsletter, he will not receive any emails from Debutify, except in special cases (i.e. follow-up or expiry of its subscription, follow-up of its free trial, participation in a contest, etc.)

The User’s information is also collected through the interaction that may be established between it and the Website and may be used for the following purposes:

* Provide services to the User;
* Manage customer accounts;
* Sending information letters;
* Contact form;

Advertising information

Debutify will contact you only if you wish. If you prefer not to receive any advertising information from us or if you do not want us to use your personal information to enhance your customer experience, please let us know by contacting us at the contact listed in the section “Right of opposition and withdrawal.”

Remember to include your full name and the email address you used when you registered or when you made a purchase from us. There may be a delay in processing time for a request sent by email or mail, and you may continue to receive communications from Debutify, in the meantime.

What are privacy rights?
------------------------

In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.

Do California residents have specific privacy rights?
-----------------------------------------------------

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we share personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request the removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below. Include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.

Third-party services
--------------------

By using the Platform, the User may engage with third-party applications (hereinafter referred to as “Third-Party Services”).

The User acknowledges and agrees that regardless of how such Third Party Services may be offered to them, Debutify merely acts as an intermediary platform between the User and such Third Party Services, and do not, in any way, endorses Third Party Services or shall be in any way responsible or liable with respect to any such Third Party Services.

The User’s relationship with Third Party Services and any terms governing the User’s payment for, and use of, such Third Party Services, including without limitation, the collection, processing and use of the User’s data by Third Party Services, are subject to a separate contractual arrangement between the User and the provider of a Third Party Service.

Debutify is not a party to, or responsible, in any manner, for the compliance by the User of the Third Party Service.

Through the Platform, the User may enable an integration of the User’s Account with Third Party Services, which will allow an exchange, transmission, modification, or removal of data between Debutify and the Third Party Service, including without limitation, the User’s Data.

The User, hereby acknowledges that any access, collection, transmission, processing, storage, or any other use of data, including the Customer Data, by a Third Party Service is governed by the agreement with the Third Party, including any applicable privacy policy. The User hereby acknowledges that Debutify is not responsible for any access, collection, transmission, processing, storage or any other use of data, including the User’s data, by the Third Party Service or for such Third Party Service privacy and security actions, inaction or general practices.

In no event shall Debutify be liable for any prejudice that may arise from such third-party services. Debutify invites the User to consult these services’ respective website, in order to learn about their conditions of use.

Automatically exchanged data
----------------------------

We collect certain information during exchanges between the User’s computer and our server. Cookies allow the User to connect to the Website.

This information consists mainly of the following:

* Domain name;
* IP address; and
* User's language.

Most of the automatically exchanged data do not allow the identification of the User. They are collected only because of the technological requirements inherent in browsing the internet. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but it is usually possible to modify this setting. However, if the User refuses cookies, he may not be able to identify himself or use certain features of Debutify’s Website.

The use of such information allows us to improve the service, personalize the User’s experience, and better track his requests and orders.

This information is also used to Stay in contact with the User and provide him with a personalized service at all time.

These cookies are multiple; some expire when the User closes his browser and have no effect, while others can be maintained.

International communications
----------------------------

Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information in the United States and other countries.

Some countries may not have data protection or other laws as comprehensive as those in Europe, Canada, or the United States. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information per this privacy policy and applicable law.

\-European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses

Such measures implement the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between our third-party providers and us, which require all such recipients to protect the personal information that they process from the EEA in accordance with European data protection laws. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners, and further details can be provided upon request.

Sharing personal information
----------------------------

Debutify undertakes not to sell the collected personal data without the User’s explicit consent. Personal data can exclusively be sold in the context of a partial or total disposal of Debutify’s business to a third party. In such situation, the disposed data is subject to the same warranties that those contained in this Confidentiality Policy.

Unless otherwise stated in this Policy, the personal information the User provides will not be transmitted to third parties without his permission. However, we sometimes share this information with partners.

If the User does not wish to have his personal information communicated to third parties or partners, he may opt-out at any time, as mentioned in the following section.

Withdrawal and opposition rights
--------------------------------

We are committed to offering the User the right to oppose and withdraw his personal information.

The right of opposition is understood as the possibility offered to the Users to refuse to allow their personal information to be used for certain purposes mentioned during the collection.

The User also has the right to request access to the personal information we have collected about him and correct any information as needed by contacting the contact person whose information is listed in the “Contact person” section below.

Anti-spam legislation
---------------------

Debutify complies with the United States Anti-Spam Legislation (USASL) dispositions. To withdraw your consent or to stop receiving electronic information or communication, please contact us at the following email address: [\[email protected\]](https://debutify.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Security
--------

The personal information Debutify collects is kept in a secure environment. Debutify has taken appropriate measures to maintain the confidentiality of personal information and protect it against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification, taking into account, in particular, its sensitivity and the purposes it is used. In addition, Debutify requires that each employee, proxy, or representative of Debutify complies with this Policy.

To ensure the security of the User’s personal information, Debutify uses the following measures:

* SSL (Secure Sockets Layers) protocol;
* Protected access to servers and computers;
* Confidentiality agreements with its employees;
* Procedures for the protection of personal information;
* Use of password-protected data networks;
* Current update of security measures; and
* Encrypted and secure electronic communications.

Debutify is committed to maintaining a high degree of confidentiality by incorporating the latest technological innovations to ensure the confidentiality of the User’s transactions to protect the User’s personal information and prevent it from being viewed, used, or disclosed without authorization.

However, since no mechanism provides maximum security, some risk is always present when communicating personal information via the internet. If a password is used to protect the User’s account and personal information, it is his responsibility to keep it confidential.

Data breach
-----------

A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure, or disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when Debutify believes you are likely to be at risk of serious harm. For example, a data breach may likely result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Debutify becomes aware of a security breach that has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, Debutify will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

--------------------------------

The Website and its content are managed by Debutify from their offices located in the province of the United States.

Whenever the context so requires, any word written in the singular also includes the plural and vice versa; any word written in the masculine gender also includes the feminine gender and vice versa.

Divisibility
------------

Each provision of this Policy is a separate and distinct whole so that a court decision that any provision of this Policy is invalid or unenforceable will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Policy.

Debutify reserves the right to modify or supplement this Policy at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice.
