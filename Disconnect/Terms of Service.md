Disconnect terms of use
=======================

Thank you for using Disconnect. These terms of use — referred to as “Terms” — apply to your use of Disconnect’s software and services (including the apps Disconnect, Disconnect Premium, Privacy Pro, Do Not Track, and Privacy DNS) — referred to as “Services”. Your use of the Services indicates you agree to the Terms, so please read carefully. Please note, use of Disconnect’s Cloud Privacy Plus enterprise product is governed by the End User Agreement located [here](https://disconnect.me/enterprise/eula).

Software license and updates
----------------------------

Access to some of our Services requires you to download a software package — referred to as “Software”. The Software is licensed to you and not sold, subject to the terms of this agreement. We grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software solely for your personal purposes. This license enters into force through your installation or use of the Software in accordance with the Terms. All rights and licenses not expressly granted to you under this agreement are retained by Disconnect. We may update the Software on your device automatically to provide new features and security upgrades.

Open-source code
----------------

Some of our code is available under open-source licenses that constitute separate written agreements. There may be provisions in the open-source licenses that expressly override these terms.

Protected property
------------------

The software and other technology we use to provide the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. These terms don’t give you the right to use the Disconnect logos, trademarks, domain names, or other brand features.

Restrictions
------------

You agree that you won’t attempt to or in fact do the following to the Services: probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network; breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures; access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, areas of the Services you haven’t been invited to including Disconnect’s or our service providers’ computer systems; or commercialize, reproduce, modify, translate, create any derivative works, circumvent, disable, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Services (our open-source code is subject to separate licenses).

Responsibility for content
--------------------------

All content submitted to or available through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person who submitted the content. By submitting, posting, or displaying content as part of the Services, you give Disconnect the right to use such content. Disconnect doesn’t control, monitor, or have any detailed knowledge of the content. Therefore, you may be exposed to info that’s incorrect, offensive, or otherwise objectionable. Disconnect shall not be liable for the content and other info spread or delivered through or in connection with the Services. You agree that you shall bear all risks associated with the use of such info. We have no responsibility to remove content you make public — for example, comments you make on our blog or forum — so please be careful with what you post.

Linked sites and services
-------------------------

We choose our third-party providers and payment processors carefully but we’re not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Services, nor their information or content. When you use a link to go from the Services to another website, your browsing and interaction is subject to that website's own rules and policies, not ours. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.
