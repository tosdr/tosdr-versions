Workona uses a variety of safeguards, including contractual and technical measures, to protect the data we transfer.
* Where required by law, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal information in accordance with applicable law, such as by obtaining your consent, based on European Commission-approved or UK Government-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, by relying on a European Commission, a UK Government, or Swiss Government adequacy decision, by relying on Binding Corporate Rules, or otherwise in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Workona has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles”) with regard to the processing of personal information received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles (together, “Principles”), the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) program, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/). To learn more about our certification with the DPF see here. Workona will transfer personal information to the U.S. based on Workona’s DPF certification, and will rely on its DPF certification as the primary mechanism for data transfers to the U.S. If Workona withdraws from the DPF, the DPF is invalidated, or otherwise personal information cannot be lawfully received based on the DPF, Workona will rely on appropriate European Commission-approved or UK Government-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or otherwise transfer personal information in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
* Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the above Principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If Workona does not resolve your complaint, or if Workona does not address your complaint to your satisfaction, and the complaint concerns our handling of Non-HR personal information, you may submit your complaint to JAMS, Workona’s designated alternative dispute resolution provider for DPF issues at [https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution). JAMS is located in the United States and their services are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions specified by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your DPF related complaint. You can find further information on the DPF website. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Workona commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of human resources data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in the context of the employment relationship. In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Workona commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of human resources data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF in the context of the employment relationship.
* Workona is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC. If Workona shares European Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then Workona will be liable for that third party’s processing of European Data in violation of the Principles, unless Workona can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

You have the right to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data by not providing said information to Workona or by not using our Services. You may request that Workona correct, amend, or delete your information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of other persons would be violated.

Workona California Resident Privacy Notice

* California residents have the right to request access to or deletion of their personal data. You may exercise these rights as described in the “Your Choices and Rights” section above, or by emailing us at [privacy@workona.com](mailto:privacy@workona.com). California residents also have the right to request additional details about our information practices and to not be discriminated against for exercising their rights. After submitting a request to access or delete your personal data, please monitor your email address associated with your Workona account for correspondence from Workona aimed at verifying your identity before we process your request. If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with written authority to submit requests on your behalf. We may also require that you confirm your request and your identity directly with Workona.
* Workona does not sell the personal information of its users in the traditional sense (i.e., in exchange for payment). However, the CCPA defines the term “sale” very broadly, including in such a way that transfers of information relating to advertising cookies could be considered a sale. As described above and in our [Cookie Policy](https://workona.com/policies/cookies/), we may share your personal data with advertising partners so that they can show ads promoting Workona on other properties. If you are a California resident, and to the extent that any of these services are considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, then you have the right to opt-out of the sale. You may opt out of the use of your information for interest-based advertising purposes as described in the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above.

### European Economic Area and United Kingdom Disclosure

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), please review this additional information.

**Legal Basis for Processing**

When we process your personal data, we will only do so in the following situations:

* We have your consent to do so. For example, we may ask your consent to send you marketing communications.
* We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the Services you have requested).
* We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your personal data to communicate with you about changes to our Services, and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.

**Your Rights**

* You have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data, including the right to access, review, modify, and delete your personal data. You may exercise your rights by following the instructions under “Your Choices” above, or by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Policy. Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain personal information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. In addition, certain choices may make it impossible to provide the Services. For instance, if you ask us to delete all your personal information and no exception applies, we will no longer be able to provide the Services since certain personal information, such as an email address, are needed to provide the Services. We will inform you when you will need to permanently delete your account in order to satisfy a request you have made.

**Questions or Complaints**

* If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, and have a concern about our processing of personal information, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your country of residence, place of work, or where an incident took place.
