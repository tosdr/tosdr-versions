11.2 Validity of information

Diffen.com is an online collaborative resource, that is, a voluntary association of individuals and

groups working to develop a common resource of human knowledge. The structure of

Diffen.com allows anyone with an Internet connection to alter its content. Please be advised that

nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to

provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.



That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information on Diffen.com; much

of the time you will. However, Diffen cannot guarantee the validity of the information found

someone whose opinion does not correspond with the state of knowledge in the relevant fields.



No formal peer review



Diffen.com is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or engage in casual

peer review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any

implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even articles that have been

vetted by informal peer review may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view

them.



None of the contributors, sponsors, administrators, or anyone else connected with Diffen in

any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate or libelous

information or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.



11.3 Trademarks



Any of the trademarks, service marks, collective marks, design rights, personality rights or

similar rights that are mentioned, used or cited in the articles of Diffen.com remains the property

of the respective owners. The use here does not imply that you may use them. Unless otherwise

stated, Diffen is neither endorsed nor affiliated with any of the holders of any such rights and as

such or similar incorporeal property is at your own risk.



11.4 Jurisdiction and legality of content

a. Medical Disclaimer



DIFFEN DOES NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE



Diffen.com contains articles on many medical topics. Diffen makes no warranty whatsoever

that any of the articles on these topics are accurate. There is absolutely no assurance that any

statement contained or cited in an article touching on medical matters is true, correct, precise, or

up-to-date. The overwhelming majority of such articles are written, in part or in whole, by

nonprofessionals. Even if a statement made about medicine is accurate, it may not apply to you

or your symptoms.



The medical information provided on Diffen.com is, at best, general in nature and cannot serve

as a substitute for the advice of a medical professional (for instance, a qualified

doctor/physician, nurse, pharmacist/chemist, and so on). Diffen is not a medical provider.



None of the individual contributors, system operators, developers, and sponsors of Diffen, or

anyone else connected to Diffen, takes or assumes any responsibility for the results or

consequences of any attempt to use or adopt any of the information presented on this web site.



Nothing on Diffen.com should be construed as an attempt to offer or render a medical

opinion or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine.



b. Legal Disclaimer



DIFFEN DOES NOT GIVE LEGAL OPINIONS



Diffen.com also contains articles on several legal topics. Diffen makes no warranty

whatsoever concerning the accuracy of any of these articles . There is absolutely no assurance

that any statement contained in an article touching on legal matters is true, correct or precise.

Law varies from place to place and it evolves over time - sometimes quite quickly. Even if a

statement made about the law is accurate, it may only be accurate in the jurisdiction of the person

posting the information; as well, the law may have changed, been modified or overturned by

subsequent development since the entry was made on Diffen.com.



The legal information provided on Diffen.com is, at best, of a general nature and cannot

substitute for the advice of a licensed professional (i.e. by a competent authority with

specialized knowledge who can apply it to the particular circumstances of your case). Please

contact a local bar association, law society or similar association of jurists in your legal

jurisdiction to obtain a referral to a competent legal professional if you do not have other means

of contacting an attorney-at-law, lawyer, civil law notary, barrister or solicitor.



No individual contributors, system operators, developers, or sponsors of Diffen, or anyone else

connected to Diffen takes or assumes any responsibility for the results or consequences of any

attempt to use or adopt any of the information or disinformation presented on this website.

Nothing on Diffen.com should be construed as an attempt to offer or render a legal opinion

or otherwise engage in the practice of law.



11.6 Content Disclaimer



DIFFEN CONTAINS SPOILERS AND CONTENT YOU MAY FIND OBJECTIONABLE



In its ambitious mission of documenting knowledge about differences between entities,

Diffen.com contains articles on a vast array of topics. A relatively small fraction of these topics

are frequently censored by educational, governmental, corporate, parental and other filtering

schemes.



• Some Diffen articles discuss words or language that may be considered profane, vulgar or

offensive by some readers.

• Diffen.com contains many different images, some of which are considered objectionable

or offensive by some readers. For example, some articles contain graphical depictions of

violence, or depictions of human anatomy.

• Many articles contain frank discussion of controversial topics. Some subjects that are

discussed have criminal applications in some jurisdictions. Others contain information on

dangerous or otherwise risky activities (see the General disclaimer and Risk disclaimer ).

• Diffen.com contains spoilers (information that spoils the end of a book, movie, or TV

series).

• Diffen.com may contain triggers for people with post-traumatic stress disorder.

• Diffen.com may contain images and videos which can trigger epileptic seizures and other

medical conditions.

• Diffen’s open platform permits contributions from the public. It therefore should be noted

that at times, graffiti may be appear on Diffen.com.



Diffen's current policy is to include such content, provided the information does not breach any

of our existing policies (especially Neutral point of view),or any of the laws of the United States

and its political subdivisions, where Diffen is hosted. Some of these articles contain warnings,

but many do not.



In all cases, Diffen.com is (and always will be) a work in progress. Many articles contain errors,

bias, duplication, or simply need attention. We encourage readers to help us fix these problems.

The great majority of articles are written primarily or solely by individuals who are not subject

matter experts, and may lack academic or professional credentials in the area.



Diffen.com may also contain obscure information that would not be covered in a conventional

resource such as an encyclopedia. Diffen's coverage of subjects may be based on the whims of its

volunteer contributors (in particular, subjects of interest to young technical people are likely, but

not certain, to receive heavier coverage than other subjects). Readers should not judge the

importance of topics based on their coverage in Diffen.com, nor assume that a topic is important

merely because it is the subject of a Diffen article.

11.7 Risk Disclaimer

MAY BE INACCURATE, MISLEADING, DANGEROUS OR ILLEGAL.

information contained in or linked from these web pages.
