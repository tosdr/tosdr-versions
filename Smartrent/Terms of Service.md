SmartRent® Service Agreement and Terms of Service
=================================================

Last Modified: January 11, 2024.

You must read through the Terms before you can click on “I Agree.” By clicking in the checkbox and the “I Agree” button or executing an order, you are agreeing to be bound to these Terms. You will not be permitted to access the Services, Network, or use the Site unless you click “I Agree”. If you do not agree, do not click “I Agree.”

### 1\. Introduction

SmartRent Technologies, Inc. (“SmartRent,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is pleased to provide you with access to the www.smartrent.com website (“Site”), our WiFi network (“Network”), and the services or Network offered by SmartRent at the single-family house, student rental, apartment and/or apartment complex (“Property”) where you visit, park, work, or live (collectively, the “Services”). Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement (as defined below), reference to the Site and/or Services also includes the content, services, and any software that SmartRent provides that allows you to access and use the Site and/or Services from a Mobile Device (“Mobile Device”).

SmartRent does not guarantee up-time or specific rates of speed for the Services. SmartRent has no control over information obtained through the Services and cannot be held responsible for its content or accuracy. We do not guarantee the Site and/or Services will be available at all times or the quality of its performance. You agree that you assume all risk associated with your use of the Site and/or Services.

This SmartRent Services Agreement and Terms of Service (“Agreement”) is a legal document and is binding on the parties, and your use of the Network is conditioned upon your acceptance and agreement to the terms herein. Please read it carefully to make sure you understand the obligations that it creates. The Agreement governs your access to and use of the Network, Services, and the Site, and the contents therein.

SmartRent reserves the right to amend, alter, or modify the Agreement at any time without advance notice of such changes. In the event we make material changes to this Agreement, we will provide you with notice, addressed to the email address you provided. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that the email address provided is active and can receive emails from us, and SmartRent will not be liable for your failure to receive notices sent to a properly addressed email.

By using the Site and/or Services, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all members of your household, staff, employees, and others who use the Services under your account. If you do not accept the terms of this Agreement, you may not use the Services.

### 2\. Assumption of Risk

You are responsible for ensuring that all devices or equipment you use to connect to the Network are running up-to-date anti-virus software. You acknowledge you are aware that your failure to maintain proper safeguards on any device or equipment connected to the Internet through the Network may expose it to worms, viruses, Trojan horses, denial-of-service attacks, intrusions, packet-sniffing, and other abuses by third parties.

You understand that wireless Internet access is inherently not secure, and you should adopt appropriate security measures when using the Network. You are solely responsible for the security of your equipment that you use to access and use the Network.

### 3\. Purchases and Payment

### 3.1. Payment for Network Connectivity

This section is only applicable if you are required to pay for access to the Network pursuant to a separate agreement with SmartRent or your Landlord.

### 3.1.1. Payment to Landlord

If payment is collected by your Landlord, then in consideration for providing access to the Network, you agree to pay your Landlord the amount due for the Network Connectivity service you elected, and further agree to abide by the payment schedule and terms established with your Landlord. Network service termination will be processed in accordance with the terms established with your Landlord.

### 3.1.2. Payment to SmartRent

If payment is collected by SmartRent, then in consideration for providing access to the Network, you hereby agree to pay SmartRent monthly the amount due for the Network Connectivity service you selected in accordance with the SmartRent Network Connectivity Payment Terms found [here.](https://smartrent.com/smartrent-network-connectivity-payment-terms/) Those SmartRent Network Connectivity Payment Terms will remain in effect until your subscription to the Network expires or otherwise terminates.

### 3.2. Payment for Product Purchases

If applicable, you agree to pay all fees or charges to your account for any product purchases you make through the Services. SmartRent will charge your payment method when your item ships. If you do not pay on time or if we cannot charge your credit card, PayPal, or other payment method for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the Service.

You expressly agree and permit SmartRent to bill you for the applicable fees, any applicable tax, and any other charges you may incur in connection with purchases made through the Service, and the fees will be billed to your account. If you have a balance due on any account, you agree that SmartRent may charge such unpaid fees to your credit card or otherwise bill you for such unpaid fees. Refunds for any purchased items through the Services will be in accordance with such purchased items’ product warranties provided by the manufacturer of such product.

### 4\. Network Registration Responsibilities

As part of completing your registration for access to the Network, you must establish an identity with your email address by selecting a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password. You agree to take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that your username and password is not used by another person. You agree that you are solely responsible for the use of your computer, devices, password, name, or username in connection with the Network by anyone other than yourself, and for ensuring that any such person does so in accordance with this Agreement.

### 5\. Equipment for Network Access

If you are using equipment such as modems, gateways, routers, or wireless cards provided to you by SmartRent, you acknowledge that such equipment may require updates and/or changes from time to time and that you may be required to perform such updates and/or changes, as instructed by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby authorize SmartRent to perform updates and/or changes to such equipment, on-site or remotely from time to time as we deem necessary.

Any questions concerning the equipment or software should be directed to the manufacturer of that product.

### 15\. Password Restricted Areas of the Site and Services

If you desire to register for an account with SmartRent, you may be required to submit your name, e-mail address, and phone number through the account registration page on the Services or we may collect such information from your Landlord, and you will be required to set your password.

### 16\. Service Communications

Acting on behalf of you, your Property Manager, your Landlord, or your Employer, we may provide notices to you regarding this Agreement and/or as part of the Services by electronic communications (including e-mails, text messages, and notifications through the Mobile Application).

These electronic communications may include notices about account updates, access codes details, two factor authentication, maintenance communications, product changes and updates, service outages, reminders, and other information concerning or related to these Terms and/or the Services. These electronic communications may affect your legal relationship with SmartRent so you should read or listen to them carefully.

SmartRent does not charge for text messages, but you may incur charges or fees by your wireless provider to receive or reply to them. For example, where a communication must be sent to a Mobile Device (for example, for the purposes of two-factor authentication, an access code) you are responsible for procuring and paying for that device, and for any charges from your mobile service carrier, which are your sole responsibility. Message and data rates may apply. Landline and international numbers are not eligible for this feature.

SmartRent relies on the contact information that you provide, including but not limited to your email address and telephone numbers, to be accurate and up to date.

You must immediately notify us of any changes to this information, including any breach of your security or unauthorized use of your Mobile Device. If you do not do so you may be held responsible for any costs, losses or damage suffered as a result.

Message frequency is dependent on the Service usage. You may opt out of receiving text messages at any time by replying “STOP” from the Mobile Device receiving the text messages. In addition, you may text “STOP” to opt out at any time. You may continue to receive text messages for a short period while we process your request, and you will also receive a one-time text message confirming receipt of your request. For text message Service support or assistance, reply “HELP”.

We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the text message Service at any time. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.

The wireless carriers supported by the text message service and SmartRent are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. If you change your mobile phone number, you agree to opt out of the text message service prior to changing your mobile number. Without limiting any other provision in this Agreement, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any third-party claims, liability, damages, or costs arising from your use of the text message service or from you supply us with a phone number that is not your own.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT USING THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, YOUR PROPERTY MANAGER AND THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY AT WHICH YOU RESIDE HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR THE SITE OR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SMARTRENT.

### 23\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver

This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver section (collectively, the **“Dispute Resolution”**) provides that all disputes between you and SmartRent shall be resolved by binding arbitration and that you expressly waive your right to a court or jury trial and/or your right to initiate a class action. For the purpose of this Dispute Resolution section, the reference to SmartRent includes its directors, employees, agents, affiliates, licensees, service providers, property landlord, and property manager. Prior to bringing action for any dispute, you must first give SmartRent an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You must commence this process by mailing a written notification to SmartRent at 8665 E. Hartford Drive, Suite 120, Scottsdale, AZ 85255. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If SmartRent does not resolve the dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.

ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO THE COURT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. YOU AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration proceedings shall be heard by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge. The arbitration shall be held in Scottsdale, Arizona. All matters within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1, et seq.) will be governed by it and not by any state arbitration law. The tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of the agreement to arbitrate. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and that this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Notwithstanding any preexisting right of the tribunal to rule upon the tribunal's power to rule on its own jurisdiction and the validity or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate, the tribunal has no power to rule on the validity or enforceability of the agreement to arbitrate solely on an individual basis. In the event the prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of the arbitration agreement will remain in force.

_Confidential_. Other than as may be required by law, the entire arbitration proceedings (including, but not limited to, any rulings, decisions, or orders of the arbitrator), shall remain confidential and not be disclosed to anyone other than the parties to this Agreement.

_Limitations Period_. Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to the use of the Services shall be commenced within one (1) year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or such claim or action shall be barred.

### 24\. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and constructed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, excluding its conflict of laws principles. The exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not covered by the terms of the Dispute Resolution provision set forth in this Agreement may be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the State of Arizona, United States.

YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY NOW HAVE OR HEREAFTER POSSESS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

### 25\. No Waiver

No waiver of any provision in this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by SmartRent. No waiver of any provision, or any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions or constitute acceptance of any other or further breach.

### 26\. Severability

If any provision or portion of this Agreement should be held unenforceable, illegal, or invalid for any reason, then that provision or portion shall be modified or deleted in such manner as to render the remainder of the provision and remaining provisions of the Agreement valid and enforceable.

### 27\. Local Laws; Export Control
