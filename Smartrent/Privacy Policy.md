4\. Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
----------------------------------------------------

We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to gather information about your use of our Site or Services. We may combine this information with other information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf).

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies or limiting tracking on your mobile device); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third-Party Analytics section.

**Cookies.** These are identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to gather insight analytics about your use of our Site and Service.

**Disabling Cookies.** Although most web browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site and Services, but some features may not function.

#### Other Tracking Mechanisms:

  

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

**Third-Party Analytics.** We use automated devices and applications, such as, but not limited to, Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site, our Services, and our App. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services and the Site. We use these tools to help us improve our Services and the Site, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. For more information, please visit [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services and the Site by going to [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

5\. Third-Party Links
---------------------

Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites. Access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these services before connecting to them.

6\. Security of Your PII
------------------------

SmartRent uses reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative security measures to protect PII from unauthorized disclosure.

7\. Access to Your PII
----------------------

If you have an account with us, you may modify your PII by logging into your account and updating your profile. Please note that copies of PII that you have updated, modified or deleted in your profile may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or App. If you wish to modify or delete PII that you provided to us, but do not have an account, please contact us so we can assist you with your request.

8\. Choices You Have Regarding Marketing Messages
-------------------------------------------------

We may send periodic promotional or informational messages to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the instructions contained in the message. If you opt-out of receiving messages about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you transactional or other emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.

9\. Retention Period
--------------------

We will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods includes: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with your Landlord for Services; (ii) there is a continued business reason to retain the information; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).

10\. Special Notice About Children
----------------------------------

Our Services and Site are not designed for children. If we discover that a child has provided us with PII in violation of applicable law, we will delete such information from our systems.

11\. Crossborder Transfer
-------------------------

SmartRent is based in the United States, and regardless of where you use SmartRent’s Site or Services, or otherwise provide PII and non-PII, that information may be transferred to and maintained on servers in the United States.

* The specific pieces of PII we collect about you.

For more information on how to request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of your PII, please see the **Submitting CCPA Requests** section below.

**Submitting CCPA Requests.** Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We will delete or de-identify PII not subject to an applicable exception from our records and will direct our service providers to take similar action.

**Requests to Know or Delete.** To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, you may submit a request by visiting our California Consumer Rights form, available at [smartrent.com/ccpa](https://smartrent.com/ccpa/), or by contacting us through the **Contact Us** section below.

**Verification of Requests.** Only you, or an individual legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know, delete, or opt-out related to your PII. To designate an authorized agent, or to make a request on behalf of a consumer for whom you are an authorized agent, please submit verification documentation through our California Consumer Rights form, available at [smartrent.com/ccpa](https://smartrent.com/ccpa/).

You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must: (1) Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected PII, or that the requestor is your authorized representative; and (2) Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We may request information from you in order to verify your identity. Additionally, we may require that authorized agents provide proof of their authorization. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with PII if we are unable to verify your identity, your authority to make a request on behalf of another person, or if we cannot confirm that the PII relates to you. In general, we will verify your request and your identity by matching the information you provided with the information we have in our records.

You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or to delete your PII.

We will only use PII provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.

Please note, if we have received your request in our role as a Service Provider, we will refer your request to the Landlord.

**Timing.** We will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 45 days of receipt. If we require additional time, we will inform you of the reason and the extension period in writing.

**Exceptions.** We may deny your deletion request if retaining the PII is necessary for us to:

* Complete the transaction for which we collected the PII;
* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
* Identify and/or repair errors that impair the functionality of our services;
* Make other lawful uses of the PII that are compatible with the context in which you provided it; and
* Comply with a legal obligation.

**Content.** Any PII we provide you with will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. Once we receive your request, validate your identity (and unless one of the exceptions above apply) we will disclose to you:

* The categories of PII that we collected about you;
* The categories of sources for the PII that we collected about you;
* Our business purpose for collecting that PII and whether it was sold;
* The categories of third parties with whom we shared the PII;
* If we sold or disclosed your PII for a business purpose, we will provide you with information about those sales and disclosures along with the PII categories that were provided and each recipients category; and
* The specific pieces of PII that we collected about you (also called a data portability request, as detailed below).

**Data Portability** For data portability requests, we will select a data format that is readily useable and should allow you to transfer the PII to another entity without difficulty.

**No Charge.** We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your PII request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing the request.

**No Discrimination.** We will not discriminate against any person for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
