Refund policy
-------------

Our refund policy is pretty simple.  
  
If you're unsatisifed with our service and have used 50% or less of your token's duration, and your order was placed less than 180 days ago, then we'll refund your order.  
For example, if you bought a one week token three months ago, but you've only first connected with the token 2 days ago (and are unsatisified with the service), we'll refund the order.  
  
Send an email to [support@cryptostorm.is](mailto:support@cryptostorm.is) to begin the refunding process.  
Be sure to include the payment processor used (PayPal, CCBill, BitPay, NOWPAyments, XMR/Monero), the email address associated with the order, and the invoice/transaction ID.  
  
For obvious reasons, the number of refunds will be limited per customer.  
Also, due to high processing fees, lifetime tokens cannot be refunded.
