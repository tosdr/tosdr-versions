Data We Gather and How We Use It
--------------------------------

### Site Visitation Tracking

Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.

Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, Internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us. GA also records your computer’s IP address, which could be used to personally identify you, but Google does not grant us access to this. We consider Google to be a third-party data processor (see [here](#gdpr-sharing)).

GA makes use of cookies, details of which can be found on [Google’s developer guides](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage). For your information, our website uses scripts generated by Google Tag Manager to implement GA. Google’s privacy policy is available at: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

Disabling cookies on your Internet browser will stop GA from tracking any part of your visit to pages within this website.

### User Registration

Should you choose to register and set up a user account with Make Tech Easier, the name and email address you submitted will be saved to this website’s database, along with the time and date that you registered. This information is only used to identify you as a user of the website and is not passed on to any of the third-party data processors detailed below. Your name will only be shown when you are logged in to the website, although if the supplied email address is linked to a Gravatar account, your Gravatar photo will also be displayed.

If you are a child, you MUST obtain parental consent before registering a user account on our site.

### Blog’s Comments

Should you choose to add a comment to any posts that we have published on our blog, the name and email address you enter with your comment will be saved to this website’s database, along with your computer’s IP address and the time and date you submitted the comment.

This information is only used to identify you as a contributor to the comment section of the respective blog post and is not passed on to any of the third-party data processors [detailed below](#gdpr-sharing). Only your name will be shown on the public-facing website. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

Your comment and its associated personal data will remain on this site until we see fit to either 1.) remove the comment or 2.) remove the blog post. Should you wish to have the comment and its associated personal data deleted, please email us here using the email address that you commented with.

If you are a child, you MUST obtain parental consent before posting a comment on our blog.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Contact Forms

Should you choose to contact us using the contact form on our Contact Us page, none of the data you supply will be stored by this website or passed to / be processed by any of the third-party data processors. Instead, the data will be collated into an email and sent to us over the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

Our own SMTP servers are protected by TLS (sometimes known as SSL), meaning that the email content is encrypted using SHA-2, 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the Internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices. However, not all mail servers are secured in such a way. Therefore, we would suggest that you always **consider email as an insecure medium** and not include personal, confidential or otherwise sensitive information within an email.
