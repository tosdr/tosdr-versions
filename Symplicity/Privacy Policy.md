Symplicity Privacy Policy
-------------------------

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2023

1.0 Introduction
----------------

Symplicity is a higher education-focused technology company headquartered in **Arlington, Virginia (USA)**, which focuses on providing services to higher education institutions, students & alumni, employers, corporations, and government agencies.

For more information about our services, please refer to our website:

[**www.symplicity.com**](https://www.symplicity.com/?hsLang=en)

Symplicity Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Symplicity,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides this Privacy Policy to describe the information that we collect, how we use and share it, and choices that may be available to users of our Sites (“you”) regarding the information we collect. This Privacy Policy applies to the web sites, including this web site (collectively, the “Sites”), that are owned and operated by Symplicity and that link to this Privacy Policy. Symplicity respects the privacy of your personal information. Since we may collect information about you, we want you to understand how we capture and use that information as related to our services, which collectively include:

* the use of www.symplicity.com (“website”)
* the use of the application **Career Services Manager (CSM)** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **Advocate** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **Accommodate/Access** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **Insight** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **Community** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **Residence** (“application”)
* the use of the application **Horizons** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **Recruit** (“application”) 
* the use of the application **CareerHub Central** (“application”)
* the use of the application **Contratanet** (“application”)
* the use of the application **Outcome** (“application”)
* the use of the application **Outcome Campus Connect** (“application”)
* the use of the application **UniHub/CareerHub** (“application”) 
    * the use of the application **Experience Record Store (ERS)** (“application”)
    * the use of the application **Placement Allocation System (PAS)** (“application”)
    * the use of the application **Talent** (“application”)
    * the use of the application **Email** ("application")
* social media messages and marketing campaigns and 
* the use of our other products and services that link to this Privacy Policy. 

Most visitors to our Sites are either (1) representatives of colleges and universities; (2) representatives of employers who are recruiting for positions; or (3) students and alumni. To help you understand our practices, we have provided below additional information describing how these visitors commonly use our Sites. This Privacy Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationships with Symplicity as:

* A Symplicity website visitor
* An end user of the application (“end user”)
    * Colleges and Universities
    * Employers
    * Students & Alumni
* A prospective client

Symplicity licenses the use of its applications to higher education institutions as a data processor for CSM, Advocate, Accommodate, Insight, UniHub, CareerHub, Residence, Horizons, and Community. Clients contract the use of our application and give access to their end users and other third parties, as solely decided by them, by creating users who access the application with their email address, username, and/or student ID. The clients’ administrators grant end users roles, which may result in different permissions and access rights to the information held in the Client account. 

**Colleges and Universities**. Colleges and universities may use the Sites for the following purposes:

* Hiring and other career related purposes in **CSM** (“application”)
* Student conduct and judicial services in **Advocate** (“application”)
* Disability services management in **Accommodate/Access** (“application”)
* Student advising services in **Insight** (“application”)
* Student housing services in **Residence** (“application”)
* Study abroad management in **Horizons** ("application")
* Student organization and group management in **Community** (“application”)
* Student services, hiring, skills development, and other related purposes in **CareerHub/Unihub** (“application”)
* Experiential and Work-based Learning and other related purposes in **Outcome and Outcome Campus Connect** (“application”)

**Employers**. Employers may use the Sites to post employment opportunities through the Sites or a college’s or university’s web site. When an employer posts opportunities through an educational institution’s web site, the institution assumes the role of the data controller with regard to personal information about the employer’s end users, and Symplicity assumes the role of the data processor. Employers may also search student resumes posted on the Sites or made available through our services if a student or alumni makes their resume available through our Sites or services, such as by applying to jobs or participating in resume books or other employment activities. When an employer posts opportunities through Symplicity Sites directly (such as Recruit and CareerHub Central), Symplicity assumes the role of the data controller with respect to personal information related to the employer end users of those Sites. Employers are responsible for providing complete and accurate personal information during collection or in case of any requested changes. 

**Students and Alumni**. Students and alumni may use the Sites though their college or university to perform various activities related to the college or university department that uses the Sites, such as to post resumes and review job opportunities.

For students and alumni that are given access to the Sites by the educational institution you are affiliated with (such as a college or university), this Privacy Policy does not govern that institution’s collection, use, or disclosure of personal information through the Site. We act as a processor (also called a service provider) to such organizations, and the educational institution acts as the data controller. Any educational records that are stored on the Sites or through our services by you or your institution may be subject to FERPA (The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) or FIPPA (Freedom of Information and Protection and Privacy Act) and are governed by your institution’s privacy policies and procedures. We are not responsible for your institution’s collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information. Symplicity will retain personal information we process on behalf of institutions for as long as needed to provide services to the institution and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Students and Alumni are responsible for providing complete and accurate personal information during collection or in case of any requested changes. Other than as directed by the institutions, we handle your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.

5.0 How We Secure Personal Information
--------------------------------------

We are committed to protecting the security of all of the personal information we collect and use. 

We use a variety of physical, administrative and technical safeguards designed to help protect it from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.

We use encryption technologies to protect data at rest and in transit. Symplicity does not guarantee or warrant to the security and privacy of any data, information or content.

Other Sites may also reference, advertise, or link to our services.  We do not endorse or sponsor Other Sites and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of Other Sites. The practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to information gathered by third parties through Other Sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit.
