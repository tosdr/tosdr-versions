**2\. Access and Use**

Our ability to invest in high quality content depends on our users complying with this Section 2. We recommend that you also read our Copyright Policy that summarises how you are allowed to use TSE Content. It also invites organisations or individuals that may be using TSE Content without the appropriate permissions to approach us with a view to discussing the purchase of a subscription to legitimize that use. Please contact us for details.

The amount of TSE Content that you can view on TSE website depends on what type of user you are. In summary, unless you are a registered user you may not be permitted to view any TSE videos including User Generated content, other then the sample videos and any other videos we make available to visitors to the site.

Registered Users

School/Institution Users: If you are a registered school/institution user: either a paid subscriber or you have been granted a free subscription for a set period of time; 2 months, 6 months or one year, you can view all the video content, download all the documents including the lesson plans accompanying the Oracy to Writing Process and upload stories.

If you have a temporary 14 day Trial Access you can view some of the website content including: Phil’s video stories and upload stories by adults, but you will not be able to view or download any of the ‘Oracy to Writing’ related documents or view User Content generated by children.

The ‘Top Up’ offer is only available to UK State funded schools. This only available once the qualifying school has registered for an annual subscription, free or paid.  The school can then obtain the School Code from ‘My Account Info’, this code can only be given to children studying at your school and their parents.

Home Users: If you are an individual registered user: either a paid subscriber or you have been granted free access via an authorised code, given by your child’s school, you can view FIP generated content, Phil’s Stories and the accompanying Home Activity Ideas. You can also upload your own stories. You can access stories uploaded by other adults but you cannot access stories uploaded by children, or any school/institution specific ‘Oracy to Writing’ school lesson plans or documents.

Individuals using  the unique ‘School Top-Up Code’ must not divulge this to any unauthorised persons.

From time to time we may invite specific groups of users to access certain sections of TSE which may be the same as or different to the access given under the above types of subscriptions, or trial access.

Permitted Use:  
All TSE Content belongs to FIP, who owns all intellectual property rights (including copyright and database rights) in the TES Content and any selection or arrangement of the TSE Content. No intellectual property rights in any TES Content are transferred to you.

You agree that User Content generated by children can only be viewed within a school setting or at school organised venues. The content cannot be viewed in the home. Under these terms and conditions schools and institutions are responsible for ensuring that User Content generated by children is only accessed in authorised circumstances. FIP does not take responsibility for unauthorised use of the website and/or any resultant consequences.

As specified in the “Restrictions on Use” section below, Schools/Educational institutions may not print/copy or redistribute any of the ‘Oracy to Writing’ lesson plans and material to any party who is not part of their school or educational establishment. You may however print and/or redistribute any of the downloadable content from the TSE website, within your school or educational establishment.

Home Users: Neither the service, nor material from it, may be re-sold, or reproduced for the use of anyone other than the named individual subscriber including the Home Activity Ideas. These are the conditions you must comply with in order to copy and distribute content from the TSE website.

If FIP notifies you that it believes you are creating, republishing or redistributing TSE website content outside of these parameters, you shall immediately cease doing so and your rights to download documents shall be regarded as having been withdrawn, unless/until FIP reaches an agreement with you regarding your use of TSE website content.

You are not permitted to share the unique Top- Up code provided by schools, with any unauthorised individuals.  By way of example only: a School/institution password is for the school’s sole use. Sharing a password with anyone outside the school or establishment means a copy of the TSE Content may subsequently be made by someone who is not authorised to do so.

Sharing your password or the unique Top-Up code provided by schools, with other Home users or schools is a breach of our terms and conditions and is likely to result in an infringement of copyright. We will always pursue any infringement of our copyright and seek legal remedy.

You also agree that FIP may stop sending messages to you without notifying you.

**4\. User Generated Content**

TSE website includes facilities for children, Individuals, teaching and non teaching staff to upload their own stories on to the TSE website. We call this “User Generated Content” or “UGC”.

If you wish to view or upload stories then you must comply with any specific rules posted on the TSE website including the Code of Behaviour.

Although we will review content before allowing it to be put the TSE website we do not take responsibility for the UGC. Under these terms and conditions

It is your responsibility as the registered user; either an Home subscriber or  subscribing school or educational establishment:

* School/Institutions must obtain prior permission from a child’s parent or guardian before you permit children to upload their stories, in particular their video stories.
* To ensure that the children are properly supervised when uploading their stories.
* To ensure that no inappropriate or offensive content is uploaded onto the TSE website.
* To make sure that all children and staff are aware of the Code of behaviour.
* To advise staff and children that although they retain ownership of the copyright in any of their UGC, by uploading UGC on to the TES website, they are granting FIP right to make available to authorised user only, the TES User Story Library for an unlimited time. All UGC is restricted to registered or subscription users only.

You are responsible for all the content of any of the UGC that  you as an individual or your school/institution uploads on to the site. You are financially responsible to us for any claim against us by any third party that your UGC is not in accordance with the bullet points below or that otherwise relates to your UGC.

You agree that you will:

1. Only permit the uploading UGC that is original content and will not infringe the copyright or other rights of any third party when uploading the UGC.
2. Not upload to or otherwise publish any UGC containing any form of advertising or promotion for goods and services or other form of unsolicited communication.
3. Not upload to or otherwise publish any UGC that is threatening, abusive, libelous, indecent or otherwise unlawful.

6. Not transmit any UGC that contains software viruses, files or code designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of FIP or any computer software or equipment.
7. Not collect or store other users’ personal data.

We will make every effort to ensure only appropriate content is approved for upload on to TSE website, but it is not possible to guarantee this. Where we have actually received notice of any UGC that is potentially misleading, untrue, offensive, unlawful, infringes third party rights or is potentially in breach of these terms and conditions or the Code Of Behaviour, then we will review that UGC, decide whether to remove it from TSE and act accordingly. If you believe that any UGC infringes any legal rights that you may have, or is not allowed under these terms and conditions, please notify us immediately with specific details by contacting us at [phil@thestoryemporium.co.uk](mailto:philmcdermott42@aol.com) FIP retains final approval of the content that is uploaded or removed from TSE website.

Children’s safety on TSE website is paramount. Nothing will appear on TSE website that will enable any child to be traced.  In addition access to the children’s library, with UGC from children, is restricted to schools and educational establishments. You must ensure that children’s UGC does not contain any information that may identify them. For example a child might use his/her home address as part of his/her story, such reference must be removed before content is submitted for uploading.

**5\. Our Responsibilities To You**

A summary of what this section means: this section is important and you should read it carefully. It makes clear to what extent, if any, FIP accepts responsibility (liability) to you for your use of TSE website or the TSE Content. Unless you are a paid subscriber to TSE website, we accept no financial responsibility to you arising from your use of TSE website or the TSE Content. If you are a paid subscriber to TSE website, we limit our financial responsibility to you arising from your use of TSE website or the TSE Content to the price you paid for your subscription. Although this means that we accept very little in the way of financial responsibility for your use of TSE website and the TSE Content, we think this is fair on the basis that the cost of a subscription for additional access rights is relatively inexpensive. It is not commercially possible for us to accept more responsibility for your use of TSE website than set out in this Section 6 taking into account that we permit you to use TSE website for no or a relatively inexpensive cost.

FIP will try to develop and operate TSE website with reasonable skill and care and will use reasonable efforts to promptly remedy any faults of which it is aware. This is the only promise we make in relation to our provision of the TSE website, and the TSE content.

Our financial responsibility to you: You agree that if we are in breach of these terms and conditions, we will only be responsible to you for any damages that you incur arising out of your use of TSE website or the TSE content (To the extent that FIP’s liability is not otherwise excluded by this section 5) as follows:

If you incur any loss as a result of using TSE website or any TSE content outside the scope of these terms and conditions, FIP accepts no responsibility (liability) to you for this. If you have paid for a subscription to TSE website, then FIP accepts responsibility (liability) to you for any direct damages you actually incur arising out of your use of TSE website or the TSE content in accordance with these terms and conditions, subject to a limit equal to the price paid by you to FIP, for your subscription during the year in which you incur the damage, you may at your option receive a renewal to your subscription free of charge at the point of renewal, in place of monetary damage. If you have not paid for a subscription to TSE website, then FIP accepts no responsibility (liability) to you for any loss or damage you may incur as a result of your use of the TSE website or the TSE content in accordance with these terms and conditions.

The limitations of liability in this section 5 apply for the benefits of FIP and the in respect of it’s officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5, FIP’s liability will not be limited in the case of death or personal injury directly caused by FIP’s negligence in those countries where it is unlawful for FIP to seek to exclude such liability.
