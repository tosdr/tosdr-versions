Our Service
-----------

MediaAlpha provides you the opportunity to obtain quotes from insurance carriers and other service providers. Once you provide us with certain information regarding your insurance needs, we attempt to match you with appropriate offerings and provide links to further information or to apply for coverage. While we publish content on the Site about insurance, we do not provide tax or financial advice of any kind. We do not guarantee that any policy for which you apply will be approved, or that any insurance carrier or other service provider to which we link will review your application or contact you. We are not responsible in any way for the conduct of the insurance carriers and other companies whose products may be displayed on the Site. The policy provided by any insurance provider will be subject to the terms and conditions under which it is issued, and we have no control over such terms and conditions. While we make every attempt to publish current information regarding a variety of insurance offerings, such information is presented without guarantee or warranty. After selecting a link to an insurance carrier or other service provider, you will be taken to such party's site where you can review the \\ applicable terms and conditions.
