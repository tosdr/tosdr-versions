Who we are and about this Privacy Policy
----------------------------------------

We are QuoteLab, LLC, doing business as MediaAlpha. We provide marketplaces connecting consumers like you with businesses that provide or can connect you with businesses that provide insurance, finance, travel, and other products and services that may be of interest to you, or that you may wish to purchase or request a quote or rates for. We refer to these businesses as advertisers or our network of advertisers. You may access our marketplaces through the websites we own and operate, our web forms that are embedded in our websites and those embedded in certain third-party websites that we partner with, by calling us, or by asking us to call, email, or text you.

**We do not provide rates, quotes, travel, insurance, or finance products or services. Any rates or quotes will be provided by advertisers participating in our marketplaces.**

**We do not act as an agent for any advertiser participating in our marketplaces nor do we sell the products or services of such advertisers.**

We wrote this Privacy Policy to help you understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. We encourage you to read this Policy, as it is designed to help you use our marketplaces in the way that is right for you.

In this Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain, and transfer information. We also provide information about your rights and how to exercise them with us. Each section of this Policy is designed to include helpful examples (where appropriate) with simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. There are also links to resources where you may learn more about the privacy topics that interest you. Of course, if you have questions, feel free to [Contact Us](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/privacy-center.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw#contact-us).

Read the full Privacy Policy below.

What does this Policy cover?
----------------------------

This Policy describes the services we offer, how our marketplaces work, the information we collect and process about you to provide our services, how we handle the information we collect about you, and your rights and how to exercise them with us.

We provide our services through our marketplaces which include:

* Our owned and operated websites
* Our web forms that are embedded in our websites
* Our web forms that are embedded in certain third-party websites that we partner with
* The telephone numbers we provide on our websites and web forms or on third-party sites we advertise on, or on postal mail (this is when you call us using these telephone numbers)
* The features and functionality we provide on our websites and web forms that allow you to request that we call, email, or text you (this is when we provide our services to you via phone, email, or text messaging because you requested we contact you in that manner)

Our marketplaces are designed to connect you with advertisers (which may include businesses, agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other types of advertisers in our network) who provide or can connect you with other businesses who provide:

* Insurance products and services
* Financial products and services
* Travel related products and services
* Other products and services that may be of interest to you or that you may wish to consider purchasing or request a quote or rates for

You may use our marketplaces to connect with advertisers in the following ways:

By clicking on the advertisements displayed on our websites.

The advertisements we display to you may be presented as online ads, text, video, or other interactive content, products and services information, rates, quotes, links, etc. ([example](javascript:void(0);)). By clicking on one of these advertisements, you will navigate to that advertiser’s website or app. Your click authorizes us to share information we have collected about you with the advertiser as part of your navigation to their website or app. For [example](javascript:void(0);), information that helps the advertiser understand you are navigating from our website, whether your navigation to our marketplaces is based on a referral from one of our business partners (e.g., when you use our web forms embedded in the websites of our business partners), and information about the advertisement you clicked on.

By using our web forms on our websites or those embedded in the websites of our business partners.

You may use our web form to ask us to identify and connect you with advertisers that may best match, or that are otherwise relevant, to your request for the products or services you are interested in or the quote or rates you have requested ([example](javascript:void(0);)). When you make your request using our web forms:

* You instruct us to share the information you provided in your request (including information we collected automatically when you used the web form) with advertisers participating in our marketplaces so they will know your request is coming from us, whether you were referred to us by one of our business partners, and so they can process and respond to your request including, for [example](javascript:void(0);), using your information to contact you (e.g., phone, email, text) to provide you with the product or services information you requested, or the quote or rates you requested, or to help you purchase the products and services that interest you directly from them
* In response to your request we will also display to you the advertisers’ advertisements (e.g., online ads, products or services information, rates, or other relevant information or content) in our marketplace to you. By clicking on one of these advertisements, you will navigate to that advertiser’s website or app and, we will share the information we collected about you and the advertisement you clicked on as part of your navigation to their website or app. Once you are on the advertiser’s website or app, they may ask you to provide additional information so they may further assist you with your request. To improve your experience and interaction with the advertiser, you may see the information you asked us to share with them pre-populated on the advertiser’s website such as in their webform on their website. For [example](javascript:void(0);), if you complete one of our web forms to connect with advertisers offering health insurance, we will display to you the top matches to your request that we can find from our network of advertisers. When you click on one of the advertisements, you will navigate to that advertiser’s website where they have pre-filled the information you asked us to share in their online form

By using our telephone numbers displayed on our websites or on our business partners’ or other third-party websites or on postal mail that you may receive from us to call us or by using the features and functionality we provide on our websites and web forms to ask us to call or text you.

You may ask us to identify and connect you with advertisers that may best match, or that are relevant to, your request for the products or services you are interested in or the quote or rates you have requested, by calling us using the telephone numbers displayed on our websites or on our business partner websites ([example](javascript:void(0);)) or on third party websites ([example](javascript:void(0);)) we advertise on or any postal mail you receive advertising our marketplaces or by asking us to call or text you by using the features and functionality we provided for this purpose on our websites and web forms. In some cases you may also ask an advertiser who participates in our marketplaces to transfer your call with them to us so you may use our marketplaces via your phone call. When you provide your information and request to us by phone call or by text message:

* You instruct us to share the information you provided to us with advertisers participating in our marketplaces so they will know your request is coming from us and so they can process and respond to your request including, for [example](javascript:void(0);), using your information to contact you (e.g., phone, email, text) to provide you with products or services information you are interested in, or provide you the quote or rates you requested, or even help you purchase the products and services that interest you directly from them. You may also instruct us during your call to transfer your call to the advertiser(s) that interest you. We will also provide the advertiser’s products or services information, rates or quotes, or other relevant information or content to you during your call with us. We may also send this information to you via email, text, or subsequent phone calls or texts based on your consent, the notices we provide to you (including this Policy), and your instructions to us

By signing up for one of our email marketing lists.

You may sign up for one of our email marketing lists to receive advertisements, marketing, and other product or services information, content, news, and updates from us about our services, our marketplaces, and our network of advertisers and their products and services. We use the information we collect about you to personalize your experience for the lists to which you subscribe.

What does this Policy not cover?
--------------------------------

This Policy does not apply to the information practices of other businesses (including advertisers who participate in our network), the products and services they offer, and their websites and apps. For example, when you use our marketplaces to connect with advertisers, the advertisers you connect with will handle the information you instructed us to share with them to process your request (e.g., for rates, quotes, product or service information) and any other information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not this Policy. This means the privacy policy of such businesses applies to any information you provide to them or is collected automatically by them (or their agents, service providers, or partners) from you. You should review their privacy policy to learn how they collect and process your information.

Learn more in our [Privacy Center](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/privacy-center.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw) about managing your privacy.

What information do we collect and from what sources?
-----------------------------------------------------

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our marketplaces (e.g., how you use our websites or webforms, telephone numbers, and other features and functionality we provide to you such as those available to you when you call us or when you ask us to call, email, or text you) and for what purpose. For [example](javascript:void(0);), we collect different information when you use our marketplaces to connect you with advertisers that offer insurance products and services than when you use our marketplaces to connect with advertisers that offer travel products and services.

What if you don't provide us with certain information MediaAlpha is asking for in our marketplaces?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the information we ask you to provide is required for our marketplaces to work and for us to provide our services to you. If you elect to not provide us with all of the requested information or otherwise provide information that is not usable, the quality of your experience might be affected. This means our ability to match and connect you with the most relevant advertisers may be impacted.

Sensitive personal information

When you use our marketplaces to request rates or quotes for health insurance from our network of advertisers or to learn more about their health insurance products and services, we will, depending on the type of health insurance and coverage you are inquiring about, ask you questions on whether certain health conditions may be applicable to you or your household such as whether you or your spouse is pregnant, has a history of tobacco use, cardiovascular disease, or other health conditions. This is typically in the form of yes or no questions (e.g., Are you or your spouse pregnant? or Do any of the following medical conditions apply to you or your spouse?). We may also ask you questions related to your physical condition such as your height and weight.

This type of information may reveal a physical or mental health diagnosis or condition and may be considered “sensitive information” (also known as sensitive personal information) under certain privacy laws, rules, and regulations.

We use this information (as more fully described in [How and for what business purposes do we use the information we collect?](#how-we-use-your-information)) to provide our services to you, to enter into and perform our [Terms of Use](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw) with you, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, to protect the life or physical safety of you or others, or as otherwise permissible for our internal business purposes consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

We do not sell your sensitive information. We do not process or otherwise share sensitive information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising. The agreements we have with our network of advertisers and our business partners require them to secure any personal information we provide to them, limit how they use such information, and comply with national, state, and other applicable privacy regulations.

If at any time you wish to request that we delete your information, or revoke the consent you gave us or object to our processing of your information, or if you would like to make any other request regarding your sensitive information, you may do so at any time by submitting a request in our [Privacy Center](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/privacy-center.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw), by emailing us at dpo@mediaalpha.com, or by calling us at 1-833-549-0351

Aggregated, anonymous, or de-identified information

For the information you provide to us and that we collect from you or that we receive from our advertisers, business partners, and other sources described below, we may at times collect information that is or further process such information to create aggregated, anonymous, or de-identified information that is not or will no longer be considered personal information or that cannot or can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to or reasonably linked to, a particular individual or household. We will maintain and use this type of information in an aggregated, anonymous, or de-identified form and not attempt to identify any individual from the information except as required or permitted by applicable laws, rules, or regulations.

Information we collect automatically

We use cookies (small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers (learn more at allaboutcookies.org or youronlinechoices.eu)) and similar technologies (such as pixels, tags, beacons, scripts, and other technologies and unique identifiers), including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software to:

* Protect and improve our services

All of which helps us to provide a safer and more meaningful experience.

The technologies we use may contain unique identifiers (which may uniquely identify your device or browser), and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our websites and web forms. These technologies may help us associate your activity with additional information about your session and personal information, if provided by you. These technologies may also transmit information about you and your use of our services, such as your browser type, device type, search preferences, IP address (which may be treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your general geographic area and to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders) and data relating to our network of advertiser’s advertisements and other content that display to you or that you have interacted with, and the date and time of your use.

For example, when you click on an advertiser's ad in our marketplace.<br>* Help us show you more relevant quotes and rates and content from our network of advertisers in response to your request and to make your use of our services more efficient while you are using them. |

Information from advertisers, business partners, third parties, and other sources

We receive information about you from our network of advertisers and may also receive information about you from our business partners that provide us services (such as suppliers, service providers, lead aggregators, contractors, and consultants), third parties, or other online or offline sources. We require each of these sources to have the rights necessary to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us. We also receive information from publicly available sources, research institutions, and professional and non-profit groups.

Here are some examples of the types of information we receive about you from these sources:

* Confirmation of purchases, transactions, and requests (e.g., rates, quotes) you make with our network of advertisers
* Your interactions with our network of advertisers such as what websites you visit and whether a call you made to us that we transferred (at your request) to an advertiser was successful
* Confirmation on whether you are an existing customer or member with one of our advertisers
* Cookie data which helps us match your activities with our network of advertisers to your requests or to other information we have about you so that we can provide our services to you and to our network of advertisers
* Communications (e.g., calls, email, text) that our network of advertisers have with you as part of our performance of our services to you and to their business, like helping them make contact with you or manage their communications with you

To learn how an advertiser or other third-party processes or shares your information, read their privacy policy or contact them directly (learn more in [What does this Policy not cover?](#policy-not-cover))

Information you provide when you sign up for one of our email marketing lists

When you sign up for one of our mailing lists (to receive advertisements, marketing, and other product or services information, content, news, and updates from us about our services, our marketplaces, and our network of advertisers and their products and services) we collect your email address and information about the products and services, rates, and quotes you are interested in.

Any other information you choose to provide

When you contact us, including by mail or email, or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question or request. The categories of information we collect from you or that you can provide when you contact us, whether through mail, email, or other means, depends on the purpose of your communication.

How and for what business purposes do we use the information we collect?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use the information we collect for the purposes outlined in this Policy including to:

* Process your request to connect you with our network of advertisers to learn more about their products and services that interest you, to receive a quote or rates from them, or to purchase their products and services directly from them
* Communicate with you, including by phone calls, email, mail, and text messages. For [example](javascript:void(0);), when you provide your contact information to us you are registering to receive communications from us directly or through a third-party which may include using those communication methods to:
    * Share information about our services (including about our marketplaces)
    * Share information about an advertiser’s products and services that we think may interest you. For example, if you request to be added to any of our mailing lists, we will periodically send you newsletters and other emails with offers and promotions. Our emails will always identify MediaAlpha or one of our branded sites as the sender. You may unenroll any time by selecting “unsubscribe” in our emails
    * Communicate with you to process your request
    * Respond to your inquiries
* Remember your settings, choices, and the information you inputted into our marketplaces to provide you with our services and a personalized experience. For example, when you begin completing one of our web forms, we will remember the information you provided as you complete the form to personalize and improve your experience. This way if you need to stop and return later to complete the form you do not need to start over again.
* Provide you with relevant advertisements and content from our network of advertisers based on your request, your activity on our services, and your activity on other sites and services not operated by us (this is based on [Information we receive from advertisers, business partners, third parties, and other sources](#info-recieved-from-other-sources)). For example, when you use our web forms to make a request for a quote or rates from our network of advertisers, we will show you the top matches. The matches displayed to you can be based on different factors such as the nature of your request, the type of product and services of the advertiser, and ultimately whether the advertiser bid on and won the right to display their rates, quotes, product and service information, or other content to you. If you select one of the matches you will navigate to their website where you may provide the advertiser with additional information so they can provide a more detailed quote to you or for you to purchase the product or service. The advertiser will communicate some of this information back to us so we can show you their quote or rates and so we are able to understand whether they processed your request and whether your interaction with them was successful.
* Advertise, promote, and market our business, our services, and our marketplaces on or by using other third-party websites, apps, and products and services (e.g., social media and other online publishers, messaging, email, radio, television and other multi-media, postal mail, etc.).
* Provide and improve our services (including monitoring, analyzing, and improving the operation, delivery, performance, and usability of our marketplaces), ad placement, ad targeting, and ad campaign success and measurement, including through the use of your location information (e.g., city, state, region, country), both on and off our marketplaces. See [Cookies and Other Technologies](#cookies-and-technologies) to learn more about our advertising practices and your choices.
* Develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our services, including our marketplaces
* Monitor and analyze trends and usage of our services
* Aggregate information we receive from you and third parties to help us understand individual needs, customize our services and offerings, and provide better service
* Conduct research and analytics designed to help us understand our customers and improve and grow our business, products, services, and customer experience
* Enhance our services (including our marketplaces) and your experience with them by using information we collect automatically by [Cookies and Other Technologies](#cookies-and-technologies)
* Enhance the safety and security of our services
* Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity
* Enforce our [Terms of Use](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw) and other usage policies
* Comply with legal requirements, including applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders

When, how, and with whom do we share the information we collect?
----------------------------------------------------------------

As described in this Policy, our marketplaces are designed to connect you with advertisers so you can learn about their products and services, request quotes and rates from them, and so you can purchase from them those products and services of your choosing. With this in mind, we share information we collect in the following ways:

With advertisers when you click on an advertisement.

When you click on an advertisement displayed on our websites (e.g., online ads, text, video, or other interactive content, products and services information, rates, quotes, links, etc. (example)), you will navigate to that advertiser’s (which may include businesses, agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other types of advertisers in our network) website or app and your click will authorize us to share information with the advertiser as part of your navigation to their website. For example, information that helps the advertiser understand you are navigating from our website and information about the advertisement you clicked on to navigate to their website.

With advertisers when you use our marketplaces.

When you submit a request through our marketplaces (e.g., through our web forms , by calling us, or by asking us to call, email, or text you), you instruct us to share and we will share the information you submit in your request with advertisers in our network (which may include businesses, agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other types of advertisers in our network) so they know your request is coming from us and so they can process and respond to your request. Please keep in mind the following important details when using our marketplaces:

* By submitting your request, you agree that we and our advertisers may contact you by phone (including through automated calling, live operators, or using recorded messages), text messages, email, or postal mail (the methods used to contact you will be based on the information you provide and the consent we receive from you), to process your request or to market products and services that might be of interest to you, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List (administered by the Federal Trade Commission) or any similar mechanism to opt-out of receiving phone calls or email or texts. If you later wish to not to be contacted by any advertiser, then you will need to contact such advertiser directly to make a request (read the advertiser’s privacy policy to learn how to exercise your privacy choices with such advertiser).
* The categories of information we share with advertisers depends on the marketplaces you are using and the nature of your request, the advertiser's products and services you are interested in, and the type of quote and rates you are requesting. For [example](javascript:void(0);), if you are requesting a quote or rates for car insurance, we may share with advertisers your name, address, telephone number, email, information about your cars and driver history, and any other information you provide in our marketplace (to learn more, see [Your request and information you provide to us](#info-you-provide))
* The information you ask us to share with advertisers and the information you provide directly to such advertisers is subject to each advertiser’s privacy policy.
    * Please read each advertiser’s privacy policy to learn more about their information practices, how they handle your information, and the choices you can make about how they collect and use your information (learn more in [What does this Policy not cover?](#policy-not-cover))
    * Please note, an advertiser may keep the information we shared with them (that you provided through our marketplaces) whether or not you elect to purchase or use their services
    * The agreements we have with those advertisers that partner with us require them to secure any personal information (also known as personal data) we provide to them, limit how they use such information, and comply with national, state, and other applicable privacy regulations

With our business partners and other third parties.

To provide and protect our services, we share the information we have about you with those businesses that provide services to us. We call these our business partners including our third-party vendors, suppliers, service providers, lead aggregators, and other third parties we work with. We share the information we have about you with our business partners under the following circumstances:

* To help us advertise, promote, and market our business, our services and our marketplaces on or by using other third-party websites, apps, and products and services (e.g., social media and other online publishers, messaging, email, radio, television and other multi-media, postal mail, etc.)
* To measure and optimize the performance of our business, our services, and marketplaces including ad performance and delivery so we can deliver more relevant ads in our marketplaces and ads we may place on other third-party websites, apps, and products and services
* To optimize our services and marketplaces so our network of advertisers are able to more easily reach their desired audience and market by sharing aggregated, non-personally identifiable, de-identified, and aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you)
* To help us and others prevent fraud, which may include sharing device, usage, and other information we have about you
* For legal, safety, and security reasons. This means we may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
    * Comply with any valid legal process, governmental or law enforcement request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation (e.g., subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances, etc.)
    * Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential violations of our [Terms of Use](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw)
    * Protect our rights, property, or safety or those of the advertisers, our suppliers, or others
    * Detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns
* As part of a merger or acquisition, asset sale, financing, liquidation, or bankruptcy. If we become involved in any merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or other acquisition of all or some portion of our business by another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.

Keep in mind, we have agreements with our vendors, suppliers, service providers, contractors, and consultants requiring them to secure any personal information we provide to them, limit how they use such information, and comply with national, state, and other applicable privacy laws, rules, and regulations.

How do third-party content, links, and integrations in our marketplaces work?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our marketplaces contain various forms of advertisements from our network of advertisers which may be presented to you in different ways including as online ads, text, video, or other interactive content, products and services information, rates, quotes, links, etc. ([Example](javascript:void(0);)). For example, when you submit information through our marketplaces, in response to your request to connect with our network of advertisers, advertisements will be displayed to you as content and links to websites owned and operated by participating advertisers. By clicking on these links, you will navigate to their website or app where you may learn more about their products and services, request a quote or rates from them, purchase products and services from them, or communicate with them. As noted above, when you click on an advertisement displayed to you, you will be providing information to the advertiser and any providers acting on their behalf as well as to us and our business partners. We are not responsible for how an advertiser and any other third parties collects or uses your information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use. To learn more, see [What does this Policy not cover?](#policy-not-cover) and [How and when we share the information we collect about you?](#sharing-information-info)

How long do we keep the information we collect?
-----------------------------------------------

How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the purpose for which it was provided and the purposes for which the information is used, whether we are able to obtain the business objective by other means, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations, and other similar factors.

Generally, we retain the information we collect about you only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill each purpose for which it was collected. For example, we keep the information we collect:

* Through our marketplaces (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it
* For the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy (including for as long as need to provide you with our services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
* For as long as necessary to resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements
* If it is aggregated, anonymized, and/or de-identified (i.e., no longer or otherwise not capable of identifying you) then indefinitely
* In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as permitted by applicable law

If necessary, however, we may retain the information we collect about you for longer periods of time after the set retention periods and deadlines expire such as where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax, and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority. We may also retain information for longer periods of time as necessary to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the choices you have made, such as to receive marketing communications.

Once retention of the information we collect about you is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete, aggregate, anonymize, or de-identify the information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information is stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the information we have collected about you and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.

If you ever decide to stop using our marketplaces, you may ask us to delete your information (see [Your Choices and Controls](#choices-and-control) to learn more).

Keep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. Also, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us. This means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other [Terms of Use](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw) violations, or if your use of our marketplaces or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other [Terms of Use](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/terms-of-use.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw) violations.

How do we keep the information we collect about you secure?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we aggregate, de-identify, anonymize, or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.

Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information we collect and you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner. These are the risks of being online and conducting business online.

Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your information, please [Contact Us](https://insurance.mediaalpha.com/content/privacy-center.html?;d2VT3kVf1gGfxYNuKhXs7OIyG53ATfvsyIbkLhTlcNI5Hc1SfAw#contact-us).

Cookies and other Technologies

As discussed in [Information we collect automatically](#info-we-collect-websites-webform), we use cookies and similar technologies (such as pixels, tags, beacons, scripts, and other technologies and unique identifiers), including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software to provide and make our services available to you and to our network of advertisers work.

Many devices and browsers give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies. To opt-out of the use of these technologies, you may change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies.

We encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser.

Before you dive in, please note, if you opt out of the collection and use of information via cookies and other technologies, you may still see customized advertising displayed by advertising networks from which you have not opted out. Additionally, your opt-out will not prevent advertising networks from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, such advertisements may be less relevant to you.
