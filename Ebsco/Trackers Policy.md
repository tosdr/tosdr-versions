**Cookie Information Applicable to our Services**

**What is a cookie?**

Cookies are small electronic files that are stored on your computer or mobile device that collect information about your preferences and navigation of websites. Web beacons (also referred to as gifs and pixels) are small electronic files that are used to count users who have visited website pages and for other related website statistics. In this Cookie Policy, we refer to these technologies, which include cookies, local stored objects, pixels, web beacons, and gifs, collectively as “cookies.”

**How do we use cookies?**

EBSCO Information Services and our third-party service providers may use cookies to collect information about your use of our Services, which enable us to track and target the interests of our users. We then use that information solely to customize the Services and to enhance the user’s experience within our Services. We also use cookies from third parties for analytics purposes to improve our performance or Services or to serve more relevant content to our users. To learn more about third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third-party’s privacy policy and/or cookie policy.

**What cookies do we use?**

We use the following four general categories of cookies:

* Strictly Necessary
* Performance
* Functionality
* Targeting

We routinely use the strictly necessary, performance, and functionality categories of cookies with our Services. You can learn more about each cookie category below.

1. **Strictly Necessary Cookies**. These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around and use the features of our Services, such as accessing logged in or secure areas. We also use these cookies to authenticate users and help identify and prevent security risks. Because these cookies are essential, they cannot be disabled.
2. **Performance Cookies**. These cookies collect information about how you interact with our Services. We also use these cookies to track aggregate usage of our Services in an anonymized fashion and experiment with new features and changes to the Services. The information collected is used to improve how the Services work.
3. **Functionality Cookies**. These cookies allow us to remember your settings and preferences, how you logged in, when you logged in or out, and the state or history of the Services you’ve used. These cookies also allow us to tailor the Services to provide enhanced features and content for you and to remember how you’ve customized the Services in other ways.
4. **Targeting Cookies**. These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests. These cookies can remember that your device has accessed our Services and may also be able to track your device’s browsing activity on websites or services other than ours. This information may be shared with organizations outside of EBSCO Information Services’, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks.

We currently do not use targeting cookies with the Services. If we do start using targeting cookies, we will add more information here.

**How do I control and review cookies?**

Users can use web browser controls or third-party software to adjust cookie settings. The means by which you can adjust cookie settings through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, so we recommend you visit your browser's help menu for more information. Please note that if a user rejects or disables certain cookies, the user may be unable to use portions of our Services. Some of the third-party websites we provide links to also may use cookies. We have no control over these linked websites or access to or control over cookies or other technology used by linked websites.
