in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized

for use.



We may share your personally identifiable information with data processors, vendors, or contractors

in order to provide you with a requested service or transaction, such as to collect charitable donations

or provide email newsletters. For example, to provide you with email newsletters we must share your

personally identifiable information with our email newsletter service provider as identified above. We

rule, regulation, or enforceable governmental or administrative request, enforce our applicable Terms

of Service, including investigation of potential violations, detect, prevent, or address fraud, security

Is My Information Shared With Other Companies?



Except as stated in our Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personally identifiable information about

We share personally identifiable information with third parties only to the extent necessary to render

services you have requested or authorized, for example to trusted business partners who process

information on our behalf.



We may share non-personal, aggregate information regarding visitor demographics, traffic patterns

and site usage with our partners, advertisers or sponsors. We may offer some services on or in

collaboration with other Internet web sites. Personally identifiable information that you provide to

those third-party sites may be sent to us so that we can deliver the requested service. We process

such information under our Privacy Policy.



We may also provide you with access to third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions,

through our website. Any information collected when you enable a third party application on our site

is processed under our Privacy Policy, but any information collected by a third party application

provider is governed by their privacy policies.

is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental

request; to enforce our Terms of Service, including for investigation of possible violations; detect,

prevent, or otherwise remedy fraud, security threats or breaches, or other technical issues; and to

prevent harm to the personal or property rights of C2CPII, or other third parties, as permitted by

applicable laws.

will conclude a processor agreement with such party that meets the requirements set out in the

relevant laws and regulations. We will require that third party processors agree to process such

information based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy, the relevant laws

and regulations and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.



How Do I Access Or Change My Personal Information?



To provide our services, and for you to gain the optimum benefits of our products and services, we

Controlled Document / Effective May 12, 2020 / Approved by: P Templeton / Page 6 of 8



appropriate links provided in our email communications, or by contacting us at

info@c2ccertified.org.



When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act on

your request, and at our discretion, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require

disproportionate technical effort or are impractical, or risk the privacy rights of other users. We may

not immediately delete copies of your outdated information from our servers and may not remove

all outdated information from our backup systems after you delete this information. This residual

retention period is necessitated to protect our information servers from accidental or malicious loss

of data.



Retention Period



C2CPII will not store your data any longer than is necessary to achieve the purposes stated in this

Privacy Policy or to comply with the relevant laws and regulations.



Specific information for personal data collected from persons in the European Union



C2CPII's services are hosted and operated entirely within the United States of America, and any

information you submit to C2CPII is presumed to be hosted on servers located within the United

States, and you consent to this storage and processing of your personal information in the United

States by accessing or using our services.



For transfers of data outside the EU, C2CPII makes sure that there is an adequacy decision from the

European Commission for the receiving party, and if there is no adequacy decision, that there are

appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data. You can e-mail info@c2ccertified.org to obtain

information on the (agreed) safeguards.



Processing personal data of persons in the European Union will always be carried out in compliance

with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU Regulation 2016/679). This means that you

have several rights as a person in the European Union with regard to the processing of your personal

data. The following overview shows the rights in general terms.



Access: You have the right to request information about your own personal data that is

collected and processed by C2CPII.

Rectification: If your own personal data is inaccurate of incomplete, you have the right to

request a rectification.

Objection and Erasure: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data

and to request for an erasure of your personal data processed by C2CPII.

Restriction of processing: You have the right to request for a restriction of the processing of

your personal data in the situations regulated by article 18 of the GDPR. For example, if the

processing is unlawful but you oppose to erasure for legitimate reasons.

Data portability: When the processing is carried out by automated means and is based on

your consent or based on an agreement, the personal data which you have provided shall be

presented to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have

the right to transmit the collected data to another controller.

Controlled Document / Effective May 12, 2020 / Approved by: P Templeton / Page 7 of 8



Withdrawal of consent: When you have given consent for the processing of your personal

data, you can at any time withdraw your consent.



For a complete overview, C2CPII refers to the text of the GDPR. Upon request, C2CPII will provide

you more specific information based on the specific facts of your case.



All requests can be submitted via info@c2ccertified.org and will be taken care of within reasonable

time. Your request will be followed up, except when C2CPII has a legitimate reason not to do so (for

example when the processing is legitimate and/or C2CPII has a legitimate interest in processing the

data, like when the personal data is needed to comply with obligations by contract or law or for a

legal action).



You may bring any complaint with respect to our collection or use of your personal information under

this Privacy Policy directly to our attention, in which case we will endeavor to respond to your

complaint within one month of receipt. This period may be extended by two further months if

necessary. If your complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction through our internal dispute

resolution efforts, you may seek independent recourse to investigate and resolve your complaint.

You may submit such complaints to your national data protection authority, or to binding arbitration

provided through a neutral dispute resolution provider. C2CPII may refer unresolved privacy

complaints to the independent BBB Privacy Shield Program as administered by the Council of Better

Business Bureaus.



What Are C2CPII's Information Security \& Compliance Practices?



We store your personal data on a secure server that is password protected and shielded from outside

access by a firewall. We practice safety procedures intended to ensure, as far as possible, the security

and integrity of all our information, including your personally identifying information. When

providing a charitable donation through our Site you will be redirected to a third party service

provider who will use industry-accepted data security means, including for example by having your

information transmitted via Secure Socket Layer technology to a third-party service provider which

is then encrypted as a part of their transaction processing. Whether during or after a transaction your

private credit card information will not be stored on our servers. However, no system or information

can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. As a result, we cannot assure or warrant

the security or privacy of any information you provide to us and, accordingly, you do so at your own

risk.



We also use a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this Privacy Policy and to

periodically verify that this policy is accurate, comprehensive for the intended purposes, and

prominently displayed for consumer review. We encourage interested persons to share any concerns

with us and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding the

use or disclosure of your information. If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our

internal processes, then we agree to dispute resolution through a third party resolution provider such

as the Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB), TRUSTe, or Direct Marketing Assoc., that also

incorporate the Safe Harbor Framework.
