In compliance with the Article 23 of the of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market for Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act), (“**DSA**”) we have established a policy for addressing users who repeatedly upload illegal content, e.g. submissions which violate applicable laws and/or  
our [Terms of Service](https://info.xvideos.com/legal/tos), including copyright infringements.

If a user is found to have uploaded illegal content to Xvideos after prior warning from us, his or her account will receive a "**strike**". Our content moderators may delete a strike if the user proves that it was clearly a mistake or an accidental or isolated incident. **Upon accumulating three strikes, the user's account is deleted and his other access to XVideos is terminated.**  
This Repeat Infringers Policy does not apply to submissions involving Child Sexual Abuse Material ("**CSAM**"), Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery ("**NCII**"), Terrorist Content, or content that gives rise to suspicion that criminal offence involving a threat to the life or safety of a person or persons has taken place, is taking place or is likely to take place. In such cases the submission shall always be directly deleted and the account holder responsible for uploading such submission will be permanently banned and the corresponding account(s) will be deleted for good.

Furthermore, although we are based outside North America and not governed by U.S. or Canadian law, we have adopted and reasonably implemented policies in an effort to voluntarily comply with anti-infringement laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("**DMCA**") or the Copyright Modernization Act ("**CMA**"). Pursuant to such policies, we assert safe harbor from liability related to alleged copyright infringement committed by third parties. Therefore, we will, in appropriate circumstances (according to the Article 8 (D) of Terms of Service – Repeat infringers policy), terminate the accounts of users who are repeat copyright infringers, pursuant to our voluntary compliance with laws like the DMCA or CMA.
