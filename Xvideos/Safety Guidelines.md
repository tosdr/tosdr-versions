Anti-piracy statement
=====================

### ANTI-PIRACY STATEMENT

Many in the adult industry are concerned about the effect that unlawfully operated "tube" websites have on the business and the bottom line of individual studios. While not every site is alike, Xvideos has been proactive in fighting content theft and copyright infringement - more so than other tube sites - and has taken several steps to ensure not merely legal compliance, but to show loyalty and give proactive assistance to the online adult entertainment community. Rather than serving as a direct competitor, Xvideos operates as, and continuously aspires to be, a content delivery and marketing component for the broader adult industry. Xvideos seeks to be a responsible and cooperative member of this industry.

In order to fulfill that goal, Xvideos has evaluated all dimensions of its legal policies and acted to ensure compliance - and for the protection of content producers - in all aspects. For example, Xvideos was the first to implement fingerprinting technology to inhibit the uploading of infringing content owned by others. This fingerprinting solution is still operating today.

Although we are based outside North America and not governed by U.S. or Canadian law, we respect the rights of copyright owners and thus have implemented certain policies in an effort to voluntarily comply with anti-infringement laws. We reserve all rights and objections to the extraterritorial application of U.S., Canadian, or any other foreign law to our operations in any capacity. Nonetheless, we believe that protection of copyright owners' content can be best supported by voluntary compliance with anti-infringement laws. Compliance with such laws is of utmost importance to Xvideos. As such, Xvideos has a registered DMCA agent with the U.S. Copyright Office, and is otherwise compliant with various anti-infringement laws, including by expeditiously processing proper notices of alleged infringement. If you would like to submit a notification of infringement about a particular video, [click here](https://info.xvideos.com/takedown).

In addition, Xvideos allows its users to submit counter-notifications when their uploaded material has been mistakenly removed pursuant to a takedown notice. Xvideos sends all such all such counter-notifications to the complaining parties, as contemplated by DMCA.

Please note that Xvideos specifically reserves the right to pursue damages, costs and legal fees available by law in the event a copyright owner or a user submits a copyright infringement notice or counter-notice without a good faith belief regarding the infringing or non-infringing nature of particular content, or to the extent an individual submitting a notice or counter-notice makes any material misrepresentations to Xvideos.

Finally, Xvideos has implemented a robust and comprehensive repeat infringer policy. In an effort to voluntarily comply with copyright laws, Xvideos has adopted a repeat infringer policy and notified its users of the policy's terms. A link to the repeat infringer policy is placed on the upload page of Xvideos.

This repeat infringer policy bans users from Xvideos if they continue to upload videos that are removed pursuant to takedown notices. When a user is banned, he or she may not continue to upload content or re-register.
