Privacy Policy
==============

We respect your privacy and collect as little information as possible to keep the site operational.

We do not use any invasive tracking software like Google Analytics. The analytics we use is called Clicky and it's GDPR compliant and also certified by Privacy Shield.

### Overview

When you visit cyberinsider.com, you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and website use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse the site.

### Personal information you choose to provide

If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with the email address and our responses. If you leave a comment on the website, the information you entered in the comment form (name, email, and comment) may be retained. As a reminder, you can use any real or fake name and email for the comment form, and the email you enter in the form will never be displayed.

### Website use information

Similar to other websites, CyberInsider.com utilizes a standard technology called “[cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)” and Web server logs to collect information about how this site is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, and time spent at this site.

In summary, we get the basic analytics data necessary to run the site, while your privacy remains secure thanks to the privacy-focused analytics deployed on CyberInsider.com.

### How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

Broadly speaking, we use this information for the purposes of administering, expanding, and improving the website for our visitors.

### The use of information collected

As you use this website, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting this site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve this site and better serve our visitors. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.

### Secure Information Transmission

Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email.

### Links to and from CyberInsider.com

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our site. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including sites which have a link on our site, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

### Your Consent

By using this site you consent to this Privacy Policy. If we change our policies, we will post those changes on this site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.
