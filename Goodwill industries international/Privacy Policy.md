**What Is Personal Information?**

By using the term “personal information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a specific individual.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**

GII collects personal information from a variety of sources, including information that you provide directly and information that we automatically collect when you access and use the Services.

1. **Personal Information You Provide**. You may provide personal information to us and our third-party service providers through the Services, when you apply for or inquire about employment with us, make a donation, inquire about partnering with us or becoming a sponsor, or when you e-mail, call, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of personal information you provide differ depending on how you choose to interact with us, but may include name, email, phone number, address, and payment card or bank account information, etc., or any other personal information you choose to provide to us.
2. **Information Collected Automatically**. We and our third-party service providers may collect information automatically from you when you access and use the Services. Such information may include personal information and includes the following:

_Usage Information_. We may collect information about how you interact with the Services. This may include information such as the dates and time you visit the Services, the page you view, referring / exit URLS, your browser type, and the domain name of your internet service provider. In some cases, we may collect this information through cookies and similar technologies. To learn more about these technologies, please see the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section below.

_Device Information_. We may collect information about the devices you use to access the Services, including your device make and model, IP address, inferred geolocation information, operating system, and unique device identifiers.

**Cookies and Similar Technologies**

When you visit our Services, we may obtain certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies and techniques. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon”, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. The information that we and our third party service providers may track with cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies may include the type of browser (such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer) and Internet-connected devices being used to access the Services, your IP address, your home domain or Internet service provider, your referrer URL (the URL for the website that you were viewing prior to visiting the Services), how you were directed to the Services, which specific pages you access on the Services, how long you view each page, the time and date you access our Services, and the total number of visitors to the Services and any portions thereof.

Most popular Internet browser applications will allow you to adjust the browser so as not to accept cookies. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device. However, making such adjustments may, in certain instances, prevent you from taking full advantage of the Services (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities, or cause some features of the Services to function improperly or more slowly.

**Google Analytics**

We may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, together with other analytics services, in order to better understand your use of the Services and how we can improve them. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a website, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other websites you used prior to coming to such website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit a website, rather than your name or other directly identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google Analytics uses its cookie(s) and the information Google Analytics collects to track your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Services, and other websites. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services are governed by the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). Google may utilize the data collected to track and examine the use of the Services, to prepare reports on its activities, and share them with other Google services. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects through the Services, please review “How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps That Use Our Services” (located [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)).

We may share personal information with third parties, such as local member organizations, trusted business partners and service providers, to help provide the Services, deliver our products and services, process payments, perform statistical analysis, protect against potential fraud, or perform any other functions consistent with the operation of the Services. We may also share personal information with professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers, and insurers, in the course of the professional services they render to us.

As we grow and develop, it is possible that out organization might change or that it might merge or otherwise combine with another organization. In any such transactions, personal information generally is, and should be expected to be, one of the transferred business assets. Also, if any bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, your personal information may be considered a company asset that may be sold or transferred to third parties.

**How Do We Protect Personal Information Collected About You?**

We take commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect personal information on the Services. We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. Nevertheless, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that personal information that users of the Services transmit or otherwise supply will be secure.

**How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information?**

We will only keep your personal information for so long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).In some cases, your personal information is retained by third-party service providers subject to their privacy policies and retention periods.
