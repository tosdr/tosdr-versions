Terms of Use
------------

### Last updated January 16, 2024

Introduction

These Terms of Use (the "Agreement") are a contract between you and PayPal, Inc. (“PayPal”) and govern your access to and use of the PayPal Honey mobile application (the "PayPal Honey Mobile App"), the PayPal Honey browser extension (the “PayPal Honey Extension”), the PayPal Honey website located at www.joinhoney.com and all other PayPal Honey-branded websites (each, a "Website"), and other software applications and online services provided by PayPal Honey (collectively, the "Service").

PLEASE NOTE:

* To receive cash back, you must redeem PayPal Rewards Points earned through use of the Service and have a PayPal account in good standing that is linked to your PayPal Honey Account (as defined below).
    
* While Points may be redeemed for cash back, other redemption options are available. You are not required to redeem your Points for cash back. Points are not money and have no value prior to redemption. Points can only be earned on eligible purchases.
    
* Points can expire. To prevent expiration, you must have an active account and earn at least 10 points during each consecutive 365-day period (for example, from April 10th of this year to April 10th of next year). This means that if you have not earned at least 10 new points in the last 365-Day period, your points will expire. For more information about the PayPal Rewards Program, read the [PayPal Rewards Program Agreement](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/pp-rewards-program-tnc).

By using any portion of the Service, you agree to comply with and be bound by this Agreement. This Agreement applies to you regardless of whether you are a "Member" (which means you have created an account with PayPal for the Service (“PayPal Honey Account”) or are a "Visitor" (which means that you are using the Service but have not created a PayPal Honey Account). The term "you" or "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. The terms "we" or "our" or "us" refer to PayPal.

Any changes to the Agreement will be posted to [https://www.joinhoney.com/terms/us](https://www.joinhoney.com/terms/us), and the posted Agreement will indicate the date the Agreement was last revised. If you do not agree to the changes, you must uninstall any applicable PayPal software and stop using the Service. By continuing to use the Service after any changes to this Agreement are posted on the Website, you agree to be bound by those changes.

Privacy and your Personal Information

The Service is subject to PayPal's privacy and data protection practices (the “PayPal Honey US Privacy Statement"). Please read [PayPal Honey's US Privacy Statement](https://www.joinhoney.com/privacy/us) found at https://www.joinhoney.com/privacy/us. Our PayPal Honey US Privacy Statement explains how PayPal collects, uses and shares your information when you visit our Website, use the PayPal Honey Mobile App or otherwise access the Service. By using the Service, you consent to PayPal's collection, use, and sharing of your information as set forth in the PayPal Honey US Privacy Statement.

Description of the Service

The Service includes a suite of tools that allows Users to search for deals, coupons, discount codes, and exclusive offers, to learn pricing and product information, and to look for savings when shopping online. As described in more detail in the PayPal Rewards Program Agreement, Members can also use the Service to earn PayPal Rewards Points. PayPal offers a variety of ways to access aspects of our Service, including the Website, browser extension and, in some countries, the PayPal Honey Mobile App. Not all aspects of our Service will be available through all channels or in all locations. For example, some aspects of our Service may only be available through the PayPal Honey Extension, or for users in certain countries.

In addition, you must become a Member to access some portions of our Service, including to earn and redeem PayPal Rewards Points. Additionally, certain redemption options may also require a PayPal account.

PayPal does not charge fees to you for its Service. We try and locate the best publicly available discounts and coupons, track product pricing, and negotiate exclusive offers that may be better than other publicly available deals. We make money to sustain the Service when you purchase or engage with these offers. While we try and find you the best available discounts and coupons, and to identify low prices, we may not always find you the best deal. PayPal is not responsible for any missed savings or rewards opportunities.

While we attempt to provide accurate descriptions for the products, offers, coupons, discount codes, sales and other information shown within or through the Service, much of the information we display (including many coupons and offer descriptions) is provided by third parties that we do not control. We do not warrant that the product descriptions, third-party offers or discount codes, or related merchant information or terms shown through the Service (including the browser extension, Website, PayPal Honey Mobile App or emailed offers) are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. The inclusion of any products within the Website or PayPal Honey Mobile App at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products will be available at any other time.

Offers, coupons, and discount codes are provided subject to availability. Exclusions, restrictions, and terms and conditions (including third-party merchant exclusions, restrictions, and terms and conditions) may apply. Deals change often, and due to this, your application of offers, coupons and discount codes at checkout may or may not result in savings for your order.

Merchant Returns

If you are unhappy with your merchant product purchase, if you wish to return your merchant product, if you ordered a merchant product and it has not arrived, or if you have another customer service inquiry regarding your purchased merchant product, you will need to contact the third-party merchant from whom you purchased the product. PayPal is not involved in your merchant product purchase and is not able to assist with any customer service inquiries or returns related to that purchase. To assist you with customer service concerns, PayPal may, for some merchants, include the merchant's contact information within the PayPal Honey Mobile App.

PayPal Offers and Third-Party Links

PayPal may display to you PayPal Honey offers and other personalized and non-personalized pricing and product information regarding goods and services offered by third-party merchants. These offers and product information may be provided in several ways, including as links to third-party websites or as coupons or discount codes you can apply to your purchase of products offered by third-party merchants.

Additionally, PayPal may display to you certain product-specific offers, which may offer you a specific amount of Rewards Points if you purchase a specific item from a specific third-party merchant ("PayPal Honey Offers"). Not all PayPal Honey Offers will be available on all devices, web browsers, or through all channels. For example, we may display a specific PayPal Honey Offer to you on your mobile phone, but that same offer may not be available to you via your desktop computer or other device. Similarly, we may display a specific PayPal Honey Offer to you while you are using a particular web browser, but that same PayPal Honey Offer may not be available to you via a different web browser or through a different channel, such as the PayPal Honey Mobile App. If shown a PayPal Honey Offer, you must follow the instructions displayed to you on that device and channel (and if, applicable, in the same web browser which the PayPal Honey Offer was displayed to you in) in order to take advantage of the offer.

To improve our services, PayPal may track how you use the services we provide, including whether you click on PayPal links to third-party websites, your actions on those third-party merchant websites, and whether you use the discount or coupon codes displayed by PayPal.

PayPal Is Not Responsible for Third Parties

All products you purchase from a third-party merchant, including those linked from the Website or PayPal emailed offer, or displayed through the PayPal Honey Mobile App or through the PayPal Honey Extension, are: (a) priced by the applicable third-party merchant (including whether such prices include applicable local, provincial, state, or federal taxes, and any additional fees, such as shipping and handling); and (b) fulfilled, shipped, and otherwise serviced (including but not limited to the processing of returns, refunds, and cancellations) by the applicable third-party merchant and not by PayPal. PayPal is not responsible for any third-party merchant products or any information contained on the third-party merchant's website (including if the third-party merchant's website is displayed through the PayPal Honey Mobile App).

You agree that your purchase from a third-party merchant is subject to such merchant's own terms and conditions applicable to such purchase. You agree that PayPal is in no way responsible or liable to you for any products you purchase through or using the Service, including for any product liability claim, improper charges, delivery failures, pricing errors, or inaccurate product descriptions. You acknowledge and agree that PayPal is not liable or otherwise responsible for any breaches of credit card or debit card security or privacy by any third-party merchants.

PayPal does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services that are displayed through the Service, including through PayPal Honey Offers and other advertised links to third-party websites. PayPal is not an agent, distributor, re-seller, broker or otherwise responsible for third-party merchants or the activities or policies of those merchant websites, or the products or services available on them. PayPal does not promise or guarantee that the product details, prices, coupon availability or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third party via our Service are the best prices, best terms or lowest rates available in the market.

When you access third-party websites through our Service, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that PayPal is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you are on a third-party merchant website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize.

PayPal has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third-party that you interact with through the Service. In addition, PayPal will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service.

By using the Service, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service. If you have a dispute with any third-party (including a merchant from whom you purchase a product in connection with the Service), you agree that PayPal is under no obligation to become involved. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you release PayPal, its affiliates, and each of their respective officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to any dispute you have with a third-party in connection with the Service. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."

Gift Cards

Third-party gift cards made available as a redemption option as part of the PayPal Rewards Program are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable merchant and/or the merchant's card issuer. Gift cards and card balances are issued by (and are solely the liabilities of) the merchant or its card issuer and not PayPal. You agree that PayPal is not responsible for any gift card program, is not the issuer of any gift cards, is not the holder of any liabilities related to unredeemed gift cards, and makes no representations or warranties regarding the gift cards available through PayPal or the products and services you purchase with any such gift card. All gift card sales are final and non-refundable.

PayPal Honey Checkout

PayPal Honey Checkout is only available for users in certain countries and may not currently be available in your country or location.

If you are located in the United States or in another country where PayPal Honey Checkout is available, you may be able to use PayPal Honey Checkout for a simpler merchant checkout experience when shopping online. The first time you use PayPal Honey Checkout, you may be asked to provide payment credentials (e.g., a credit card number, CVV/CVC code and expiration date). You authorize us to store those payment credentials for you so that any time you use PayPal Honey Checkout, you can automatically use your preferred payment information to complete checkout. Your checkout will still be directly with the applicable merchant. We are not responsible for any goods or services you purchase using PayPal Honey Checkout.

You represent and warrant that the payment credentials you provide are accurate and that you are authorized to charge transactions to the account represented by those credentials. You should keep your payment credentials up to date through your PayPal Honey Account. You can also delete your payment information from your PayPal Honey Account at any time. Deleting your payment information will not affect any transaction that you already authorized.

If you store payment credentials with PayPal Honey Checkout, it is important that you secure your log-in information, including your password, to prevent unauthorized use of or access to those payment credentials. Once enabled, PayPal Honey Checkout is always active on any device where you are logged into your PayPal Honey Account through the PayPal Honey Extension. This means that payments may be completed using your payment credentials with PayPal Honey Checkout on that device, so you should secure your device and/or log out of your PayPal Honey Extension when not using your device in order to help prevent unauthorized use of or access to the payment credentials you have stored in PayPal Honey Checkout.

PayPal Honey Mobile App

The PayPal Honey Mobile App is only available for users in certain countries and may not currently be available in your country or location.

The PayPal Honey Mobile App works on an application linked to a particular device and operating system, such as Apple's iOS operating system. Your use of the PayPal Honey Mobile App may be subject to separate agreements you may enter into with your mobile device operating system provider (e.g., Apple®, Google® or Microsoft®), your mobile device manufacturer (e.g., Apple®, Samsung®), your mobile service carrier (e.g., AT&T® or Verizon®), and other parties involved in providing your mobile device service (which we individually refer to as a "Covered Third Party" and which we collectively refer to as "Covered Third Parties"). You agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the PayPal Honey Mobile App. We are not a party to those agreements and we have no responsibility for the products and services provided by third parties. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement is between you and PayPal, not with any Covered Third Party. You acknowledge and agree that we (and not any Covered Third Party) are solely responsible for the PayPal Honey Mobile App and for providing any maintenance or support services for the PayPal Honey Mobile App.

Covered Third Parties have no warranty obligations whatsoever with respect to the PayPal Honey Mobile App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure of the PayPal Honey Mobile App to conform to any warranty provided by us (if any), will be our sole responsibility.

We, not any Covered Third Parties, are responsible for addressing any claims relating to the PayPal Honey Mobile App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the PayPal Honey Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation; and (iv) intellectual property claims.

If you are using the PayPal Honey Mobile App on an Apple® or Google® device, you acknowledge and agree that Apple® or Google® (as applicable), and their subsidiaries (as applicable), are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that they will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary. Such rights may also accrue to other handset manufacturers and operating systems which participate in the PayPal Honey Mobile App.

To the extent the other terms and conditions of the rest of this Agreement conflict with the terms and conditions of this section, the terms and conditions in this section apply, but solely with respect to your use of the PayPal Honey Mobile App downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

Account Information from Third Party Sites

When you establish a PayPal Honey Account, we may allow you to register your account, log-in, or otherwise link your PayPal Honey Account with an account you maintain with a third-party, such as Facebook® or Google® ("Linked Account"). You represent that any Linked Account belongs to you and you are permitted to link it to your PayPal Honey Account. PayPal does not control the policies and practices of any third-party site or service, including any Linked Account you connect to the Service and PayPal is not responsible for any actions or omissions of providers of a Linked Account, including related to accuracy, legality or non-infringement. PayPal is not responsible for the products and services offered by or through your Linked Account. If permitted by your Linked Account, PayPal may import information from your Linked Accounts to help better offer the Service to you.

PayPal Rewards Program

The PayPal Rewards Program (the "PayPal Rewards Program", formerly known as the Honey Gold Program) is offered by PayPal to Users with PayPal Honey Accounts via the PayPal Honey mobile app, https://www.joinhoney.com, the PayPal Honey Extension made available to PayPal Honey Account users participating in the PayPal Rewards Program, and such other channels as PayPal Honey may make available from time to time. Your access to and use of the PayPal Rewards Program is governed by the [PayPal Rewards Program Agreement](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/pp-rewards-program-tnc), which is incorporated herein by reference. Any capitalized terms relating to the Rewards Program that are not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the PayPal Rewards Program Agreement.

Referral Program

PayPal may, from time to time, allow you to earn PayPal Rewards Points in connection with taking actions to promote the Service, including by referring a friend to the Service ("Referral Program"). To be eligible to earn Points through the Referral Program (i) you must refer a new user to the Service by providing your personalized link, (ii) the new user must use your link to create a user account and become a Member and (iii) the new user must make a qualifying purchase using their Member account and earn Points.

You may not attempt to earn Points in connection with the Referral Program through fraud, deceit, or artificial or illegal means, including by creating multiple or duplicate accounts, engaging in a bot network, spam, advertising or any paid promotional channel. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold Points for any reason in connection with the Referral Program with or without cause. We may also limit, in our sole discretion and without prior notice, the amount of Points you may earn through the Referral Program or any aspect thereof. Failure to comply with this Agreement or any fraudulent or abusive actions may result in the removal of PayPal Rewards Points from your account, and may also result in PayPal suspending or closing your account and/or suspending or terminating your access to the Service.

Your Log-In and Account Information

You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Log-in ID, email address, password and any other personal identifying information or other codes used to access your PayPal Honey Account or the Service ("Log-In Information"). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Log-In Information, you agree to notify PayPal immediately.

Accurate records enable PayPal to provide the Service to you. You agree to keep your email address, your other contact information and any payment information in your PayPal Honey Account profile accurate and up-to-date. If you do not do this, the accuracy and effectiveness of the Service to you will be affected and you may not receive account notices that we deliver to you. If you fail to keep your contact information updated, you will still be deemed to have received any notices we deliver to the email address you last provided.

Electronic Notices

By providing us with your email address, you agree to receive all account related notices electronically, to that e-mail address. It is your responsibility to update or change that address, as appropriate. Notices will be provided in HTML (or, if your system does not support HTML, in plain-text) in the text of the e-mail or through a link to the appropriate page on our site, accessible through any standard modern, commercially available internet browser. We may also use your email address to contact you about our own and third-parties' goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please adjust your user preferences in your account profile and /or click "Unsubscribe" in any e-mail communications we send you.

Electronic Notifications

PayPal may provide you with electronic notifications by email, push notification or other electronic means. Some electronic notifications are mandatory, including security-related notifications, such as when you update your log-in information or password.

Other types of notifications are voluntary and may be modified through the Service. They may be customized, deactivated or reactivated by you. These notifications allow you to choose alert messages for your account. PayPal may add new notifications from time to time, or cease to provide certain notifications at any time upon its sole discretion. Each alert has different options available, and you may be asked to select from among these options upon activation of your notifications service. You may also be able to modify how you receive push notifications via the PayPal Honey Mobile App through your mobile device by changing your mobile device settings.

Electronic notifications will be sent to the email address you have provided as your primary email address for the Service.

Because notifications are not encrypted, we will never include your password. However, notifications may include your PayPal Honey Account login information and some information about your accounts. Anyone with access to your email will be able to view the content of these notifications. While you may disable certain voluntary notifications, we will still send you Service-related notices as needed to allow us to provide you the Service.

Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Service or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.
