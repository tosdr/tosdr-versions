PayPal Honey Privacy Statement
------------------------------

### Last updated October 28, 2024

Introducing the Privacy Statement

This privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) explains how PayPal, Inc. (“PayPal Honey” or “we”) collects and processes information from members and users of the website, software applications, and other online services we provide (collectively “PayPal Honey's products”). PayPal Honey's products include, but are not limited to, the PayPal Honey extension for web browsers (the “Extension”), the PayPal Honey mobile application (the “Mobile App”), and the website located at www.joinhoney.com (the “Website”), collectively, (the “Services”).  
  
To the extent that PayPal Honey has links to other websites (like retailers), please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.

What data we collect and why

_Personal Identifiers._  
  
In order to provide our Services, PayPal Honey collects information that you share directly with us when you use the Services.  
  
During the registration process we may collect your name, email address, IP address, your device's unique ID (where available), member password and other registration information. When you sign up with your existing PayPal account, PayPal Honey sees basic profile information you provided to PayPal, like your name, email address and country location. We may also collect information needed to complete your purchases, such as your billing address.  
  
We may also collect any other information you provide when you communicate with PayPal Honey through email or other means.  
  
If you choose to link a social media profile (like Facebook) at sign-in, PayPal Honey will store this information for login purposes. Linking your social media profile grants PayPal Honey access to the profile, but only to the extent allowed by your permission settings, that social media platform's terms of service, and this Privacy Statement. We do not track your social media activity or post anything on your behalf.  
  
_PayPal Honey Payment Information._  
  
We may collect your payment information when you purchase gift cards or other products or services from PayPal Honey. We also save your payment information to your PayPal Honey account in order to allow you to check out easier when shopping on retailers' websites. In those cases, you will be asked to input a payment option (i.e., a debit or credit card), as well as information needed to complete those purchases (such as your billing address). In those instances, your payment information is securely stored with our payment processor, Braintree (a PayPal service). Alternatively, if you purchase an item on a third-party merchant's website displayed within the PayPal Honey Mobile App, that merchant (not PayPal Honey) will collect, store, and process your payment information in connection with that purchase.  
  
_Commercial Information._  
  
We collect information about your purchases on retail sites when using PayPal Honey as well as shopping activity and goods or services considered on our merchants, partners, sites or businesses that our users transact with for the purpose of obtaining goods or services (“Partners and Merchants”).  
  
_Internet or Network Activity._  
  
We collect this information to provide PayPal Honey members with a better way to shop online and to help us develop, improve, and market our Services. This may include data such as:

* the type of device you're using
* operating system
* browser type
* event stamp
* error logs
* information about the retail site that lets us know which coupons and promos to find for you
* information about pricing and availability of items
* name of the retailer
* page views

To understand how you engage with our Services, we use common digital tools that allow us to see if you opened an email we sent, visited a link in those emails, or generally interacted with PayPal Honey as a result of our marketing efforts.

_Shopping and Usage Data._  
  
On retail sites, PayPal Honey collects the name of the retailer, page views, and in some cases, product information that allows us to track price changes and update our product catalog. We may also collect information regarding your purchases on a retail site while using PayPal Honey (for example, the transaction value, and the fact that an order was completed or returned) for purposes including internal analytics, commission collection, and managing Rewards. The information enables us to improve our products and gives us insights about coupons, deals, pricing, and availability of retail items, which we can offer to the rest of the PayPal Honey community. We may also use this information to understand your shopping history, merchant and shopping preferences to provide you with a more tailored, relevant experience or show sponsored product offers that may interest you when you use the Services or you use the PayPal or Venmo services.  
  
When you are on a retailer's site that offers the Services, PayPal Honey will collect information about that site that lets us know which coupons and promos to find for you.  
  
As you use our Services, we might also collect data, such as:

* items you save in order to monitor price drops (Droplist)
* coupons, promo codes, and deals you found
* friend referrals from your contacts to PayPal Honey
* stores you “follow”

_Inference Data._  
  
We may infer information about you such as your preferences and shopping behavior, based on your interactions with our Services or with our Partners and Merchants.  
  
_Sensitive Personal Data._  
  
We may disclose your sensitive personal information as appropriate to carry out legitimate business activities allowed by law, but we do not sell or share your sensitive personal data.  
  
_Aggregate and Anonymized Data._  
  
We may also use the information we collect in aggregate or otherwise anonymized form. This lets us look at interactions with our site and products generally and does not identify you or any specific person. We use this general data for research, development, marketing, analytics, and to enhance the shopping experience for the Honey community.
