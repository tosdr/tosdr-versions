**COOKIES POLICY**
==================

Updated February 20th, 2024

GENERAL

This cookies policy (“Policy”) describes how we use cookies and other similar technologies, in connection with our websites and services. References to “we”, “us”, “our” or “Payoneer” means Payoneer Inc. and its affiliates, including Payoneer Europe Limited, Payoneer Payment Services (UK) Limited, Payoneer Singapore Private Limited, Payoneer Hong Kong Limited and Payoneer Australia Pty Ltd.

We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking technologies (including tracking technologies designed for mobile applications) to track information about your use of our websites and our services available through our websites or our mobile application. We may combine such information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf). 

The information set out in this Policy is provided in addition to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.payoneer.com/legal/privacy-policy/) and should be read alongside it, as well as the Terms and Conditions applicable to you and the services you use.

WHAT ARE COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?

* **Cookies**. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are stored on your computer’s hard drive (through your web browser) for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our websites and use our services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities when visiting our websites.

* **Local Storage Objects**. Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) may be used to store your preferences and to personalize your visit in our website. Flash LSOs are different from cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, users cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through their web browser.

* **HTML5 Storage**. We may store your user information and website preferences locally within your web browser via HTML5.

* **Clear Gifs and Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies**. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), to, among other things, track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile usage statistics. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

For purposes of this Policy, all references to “cookies” may include other similar technologies as well.

COOKIES WE USE AND HOW WE USE THEM

Cookies help us provide our services in a safer and more efficient manner by allowing us to collect technical usage data, device related information and details regarding your location. Below you can find a description of the types of cookies we use and the purpose for using them. Each category below refers to the different categories displayed in our **_Privacy Preference Center_** which is accessible by clicking on the **_Cookies Settings_** which can be found on the Payoneer.com footer, and where you can find more information about each cookie we use, as well as exercise your specific preferences at any time.

We use both first and third-party cookies as follows:

* **First party cookies** are cookies placed by us directly when you visit our websites and use our services.

* **Third-party cookies** are cookies set by other companies or domains for analytics and similar purposes. For information about the processing by these third parties for their own purposes, if relevant, see the respective policies of these third parties.

Cookies are generally categorized as follows:

* **Strictly Necessary Cookies**. These cookies are necessary for functionality, security and authentication purposes and cannot be switched off. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the website will not work properly in such case. They include, for example, cookies that enable users to log into secure areas of our website.

* **Statistics Cookies**. Statistics cookies help us to understand how our visitors use our websites.

* **Performance Cookies**. These types of cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors navigate through our website. This helps us improve the way our websites work by, for example, ensuring that you can easily find what you are looking for.

* **Functional Cookies**. These cookies enable our websites to provide enhanced functionality, personalization of content, recognition of users, and remember your user preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our websites. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.

* **Marketing Cookies**. These cookies record your visit to our websites, the individual pages you visited, and the links followed. If the cookie is set by a third party (for example, an advertising network) which also monitors traffic on other websites, this type of cookie may also be used to track your movements across different websites and to create profiles of your general online behavior. Information collected by tracking cookies is commonly used to target online advertising. Marketing cookies comprise of Social Media cookies and Targeting cookies:
    * **Social Media cookies** are set by a range of social media services that we have added to our websites to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use or see these tools.
    * **Targeting cookies** may be set by us or by our advertising service providers to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant targeted advertisements related to Payoneer’s services when you visit other websites. These cookies do not directly store personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet devices.

Depending on where you are geographically based, we may require your consent for using cookies of all categories other than those that are “strictly necessary” cookies, obtained through a banner which will appear during your first visit to our website. You may withdraw your consent at any time by using the **_Privacy Preference Center_** which is accessible by clicking on the **_Cookies Settings_** which can be found on the Payoneer.com footer

****CHANGING OR DISABLING YOUR COOKIE SETTINGS****

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. Visitors to our websites who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our websites, however, most site features may not function if you disable cookies and you may not be able to login to our services.

You can also withdraw consent to the placement of cookies at any time by accessing the **_Privacy Preference Center_** which is accessible by clicking on the **_Cookies Settings_** which can be found on the Payoneer.com footer. You can reject all cookies except strictly necessary cookies.

Please note that in order to delete all cookies across all your devices you will need to separately adjust your cookie settings for each device.

**DO NOT TRACK**

Currently, our systems do not honor browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling Cookies); you also may opt-out of Third Party Analytics or targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Networks section below.

THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS

We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics to evaluate the use of our websites and services and help us improve our services, performance and user experience. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services and may collect your device ID, IP address, or other information about your use of our services as part of the analytics service they provide us.

You can opt-out of any analytics cookies by using the **_Privacy Preference Center_** which is accessible by clicking on the **_Cookies Settings_** which can be found on the Payoneer.com footer. Specifically for Google Analytics, you can also go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Please note that if you use a new or different computer, install a new browser or clear your cookies, you will need to re-opt-out through the aforementioned link.

THIRD-PARTY AD NETWORKS

We use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing agents, to display advertisements on our website, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our website and unrelated third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your use of our website and our services, as well as aggregated or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our website and users of our services.

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).

For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites:

* NAI – https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1 
* DAA – [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) 

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks only means that those members will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit their opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or mobile device or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information may be available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites accessible by the above links.

PERSONAL DATA PROCESSED BY COOKIES

For further information about how we process personal data collected by cookies, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.payoneer.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may modify this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “Last Updated” date above and post the updated Policy on this page.
