Terms of Service
================

_Last updated: August 04, 2018_

Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the WeatherWidget.io website and our Widget Embeds (the "Service").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not use the Service.

Our free widgets may be embedded only in publicly accessible web pages. You may not embed our free widgets in mobile applications, digital signage, web pages which are not publicly accessible or any other application.

You may use our Service to add up to 8 weather widgets per page, and up to 35 different locations (e.g. cities) per website. Note that this does not limit the total number of widgets you can place on each website as long as the location limits are not exceeded.

By default the whole widget links to a page at Forecast7.com with a more detailed weather forecast. You may not modify the widget code or prevent in any other way the visitors of your website from following this link.

We reserve the right to block access to those who abuse our Service or violate these terms. Please [contact us](https://weatherwidget.io/contact/) if you would like to embed our widget in anything other than a publicly accessible website or if you need widgets for more than 35 locations per website.
