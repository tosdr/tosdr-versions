===============

After the purchase you will directly have the right to use Zen and be able to use it in the way as is stipulated.

18.2 ANY APPLICABLE ZEN, FEES AND OTHER CHARGES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND NON REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REGARDLESS OF THE PAYMENT METHOD, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW INCLUDING ANY NON-EXCLUDABLE RIGHTS.

Unless otherwise required by law including any Non-Excludable Rights, your purchase of Zen is not refundable for any sum of money, monetary value, or anything of value from Arc Games at any time.

18.4 We may, from time to time, modify, amend, or supplement our fees, billing methods and terms applicable to Zen or to any purchases, and post those changes in these Terms, in separate terms of sale or in other terms or agreements posted on the Website or Service or otherwise provided to you by us.

If any change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your account at any time.

European Union and UK users have a right of withdrawal from certain transactions subject to applicable laws.  This right of withdrawal ends 14 days after you purchase the Game or when you start downloading the Game or other digital content, whichever occurs earlier. Therefore, for any digital content or Game that you purchased online, you agree upon checkout that the withdrawal period will expire 14 days after you purchase such content or Game or when you start downloading the content of Game, whichever is earlier. You acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal once you start downloading or streaming any such digital content or Game.

As such, we honor your request to withdraw made within 14 days of such purchase (or for pre-purchases, 14 days from release), provided that you have not started downloading the Games. If you withdraw pursuant to this Section, we will reimburse you all payment(s) that you made for the purchase of such Game. To exercise the right of withdrawal you must inform us by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail to the address below). You can use the model withdrawal form below.

**24.****Conflict and Dispute Resolution** **(excluding EU, UK and Australian Users)**
======================================================================================

24.1 In the event of any controversy, allegation or claim that arises out of or relates to the Services or this Agreement, Arc Games and you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending a notice of dispute via email (for Arc Games, to [**legal@arcgames.com**](mailto:legal@arcgames.com) with the subject line of “Attn: Legal”). Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provided us.

24.2 Your notice to Arc Games must include your name, mailing address, and phone number (if any), and must describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, as well as set forth the specific relief sought. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days from the notice, either party can submit this matter to arbitration pursuant to this section.

24.3 Arbitration. Please read the following sections carefully, as they affect your rights. You and Arc Games agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Service through final and binding arbitration, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, and includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. You acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and thus the United States Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the arbitration clause in these Terms.

24.4 Opting-Out of Arbitration. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BY PROVIDING ARC GAMES WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF FIRST ACCEPTING THESE TERMS. YOUR NOTICE MUST INCLUDE: (I) YOUR FULL NAME (FIRST AND LAST); (II) THE EMAIL ADDRESS YOU USED TO REGISTER YOUR ACCOUNT; AND (III) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DECLINE THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. EMAIL YOUR OPT-OUT NOTICE VIA EMAIL TO: [**legal@arcgames.com**](mailto:legal@arcgames.com) WITH THE SUBJECT LINE: “Attn: Legal”.

24.5 Costs of Arbitration. Arc Games will pay all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration we initiate. You will pay the fees for any arbitration you initiate, in accordance with the JAMS Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration after attempting to informally resolve a dispute in accordance with these Terms, and are seeking relief valued at (i) $300 or less (both to you and us), Arc Games will pay all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees or (ii) greater than $300 but less than $10,000, Arc Games will pay all such fees in excess of $20. After Arc Games receives notice at the email address above that you have commenced such an arbitration, Arc Games shall promptly reimburse you for any portion of the filing fee you have paid that Arc Games has agreed to pay.

24.6 Frivolous Claims. If the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and you agree to reimburse us for any amount we have paid on your behalf to JAMS. Arc Games shall not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.

24.7 Arbitration Procedures. You agree that one arbitrator from JAMS will arbitrate the dispute under the JAMS Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The award of the arbitrator shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or any other location that we mutually agree to.

24.8 No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. You may not bring a claim as part of a class arbitration, class action, private attorney general action, or consolidation with other arbitrations.

24.9 Applicable Law and Judicial Forum. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods. In the event that this agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Arc Games agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Mateo County, California. Both you and Arc Games consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there, and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

24.10 Time Limitation to Bring Claims. Notwithstanding any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, otherwise that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.

24.11 Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if Arc Games makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice email address above, website links, or telephone numbers listed in this provision), any such changes will not affect disputes that arose before the effective date of the change.
