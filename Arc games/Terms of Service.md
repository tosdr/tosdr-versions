**27.         Agreement to Arbitrate.**

27.1 Arbitration. Please read the following sections carefully, as they affect your rights. You and Gearbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Service through final and binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, and includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. You acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and thus the United States Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the arbitration clause in these Terms.

27.2 Opting-Out of Arbitration. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BY PROVIDING GEARBOX WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF FIRST ACCEPTING THESE TERMS. YOUR NOTICE MUST INCLUDE: (I) YOUR FULL NAME (FIRST AND LAST); (II) THE EMAIL ADDRESS YOU USED TO REGISTER YOUR ACCOUNT; AND (III) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DECLINE THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. EMAIL YOUR OPT-OUT NOTICE VIA EMAIL TO: [legal@gearboxsf.com](mailto:legal@gearboxsf.com) WITH THE SUBJECT LINE: “Attn: Legal”

27.3 Costs of Arbitration. Gearbox will pay all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration we initiate. You will pay the fees for any arbitration you initiate, in accordance with the JAMS Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration after attempting to informally resolve a dispute in accordance with these Terms, and are seeking relief valued at $300 or less (both to you and us), Gearbox will pay all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. If your claim is for greater than $300 but less than $10,000, Gearbox will pay all such fees in excess of $20. After Gearbox receives notice at the email address above that you have commenced such an arbitration, Gearbox shall promptly reimburse you for any portion of the filing fee you have paid that Gearbox has agreed to pay.

27.4 Frivolous Claims. If the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and you agree to reimburse us for any amount we have paid on your behalf to the JAMS. Gearbox shall not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.

27.5 Arbitration Procedures. You agree that one arbitrator from the JAMS will arbitrate the dispute under the JAMS International Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The award of the arbitrator shall be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or any other location that we mutually agree to.

27.6 No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. You may not bring a claim as part of a class arbitration, class action, private attorney general action, or consolidation with other arbitrations.

27.7 Judicial Forum. In the event that this agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Gearbox agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Mateo County, California. Both you and Gearbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there, and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

27.8 Time Limitation to Bring Claims. Notwithstanding any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, otherwise that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.

27.9 Future Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if Gearbox makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the notice email address above, website links, or telephone numbers listed in this provision), any such changes will not affect disputes that arose before the effective date of the change.

28.3 Some member states in the EU do not allow the foregoing limitations of liability by (mandatory) law, so they may not apply to you.
