Arc Games Inc. and Arc Games B.V. (collectively “Arc Games”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) use and maintain this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that summarizes when and how your Personal Information is collected, used, safeguarded and disclosed in connection with your use of the Websites, and any games and game platforms, clients software, downloaded software or servers operated by Arc Games through the Website or otherwise supported by Arc Games on the Website (each, the “Game”, and collectively, the “Games”), and all features, functions, software and services offered through this Website. The Website, the Games and the features, functions, software and services offered through this Website collectively constitute the “Service.” This Privacy Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your Personal Information.

**1\. What is Personal Information?**

As used herein, the term “Personal Information” means information is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address, or other account number), and information about that individual’s location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Service, IP addresses or mobile device identifiers. Personal Information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences. Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other Personal Information has been removed. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Service. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**2\. What Information Do We Collect and For Which Purposes?**

**Active Collection**

Personal Information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit or use our Service. For example, we may collect your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account, or contact us by email or other means for any reason. When you make a purchase, we may also collect your credit card or other payment or billing information. Personal Information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any interactive chat rooms, forums, social media platform or other features on the Website or Service, or when you use our Games. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other Personal Information you provide in connection with your voluntary participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities. You can access certain portion of our Service without providing us with any Personal Information. However, you will not be able to utilize certain features that require registration or receive materials unless certain information is provided.

To the extent that the processing of this Personal Information is necessary for the performance of our Service, we rely on art. 6.1.(b) of the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) if and insofar as the GDPR applies. Where processing is not necessary for the performance of the Service and other legal basis (such as, for example, our legitimate interest in the sense of art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR if and insofar as the GDPR applies) are inapplicable, your consent to such processing will be requested. From time to time we may change the information requested upon registration or with respect to certain features or services, so this may not be a complete list.

From time to time we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on the Service which may contain Personal Information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [privacy@arcgames.com](mailto:privacy@arcgames.com).

**Facebook Connect**

You can log in to our Service using Facebook’s sign-in service (“Facebook Connect”). This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form. We may also collect other information from Facebook, including, but not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that Service, any information that you have permitted Facebook to share with us, and any information you have made public on Facebook. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, such information may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join our Service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on Facebook before linking or connecting them to our Website or Service. You may also unlink your Facebook account from the Service by adjusting your Facebook settings. You may also have the option to post information about your activities on this Service to your Facebook profile page to share with others within your network.

**Log Files**

When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser or mobile device type and language, access times, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We also use website analytics tools on our Service to retrieve information from your browser or mobile device, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within the Service, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height and other information that assists us in improving the Service.

We also deliver advertisements and provide website analytics tools on non-Arc Games sites and our Services, and we collect information about page views on these third party sites as well.

To the extent the processing of your Personal Information for this purpose is necessary to deliver the Service, and if and insofar as the GDPR applies, we rely on art. 6.1.(b) of the GDPR. To the extent that the processing of your Personal Information is required for our legitimate interest to better understand your use of the Service, and if and insofar as the GDPR applies, we rely on art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR. If you are located in the European Union, and as described in our Cookie Policy, we will only use certain cookies when you have given your consent for this. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

**Tracking Technologies**

We may collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or other similar tracking technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.arcgames.com/en/about/cookie) for more information.

**Device Identifiers**

When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may use, access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

To the extent the processing of your Personal Information for this purpose is necessary to deliver the Service, and if and insofar as the GDPR applies, we rely on art. 6.1.(b) of the GDPR. To the extent that the processing of your Personal Information is required for our legitimate interest to better understand your use of the Service, and if and insofar as the GDPR applies, we rely on art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR.

**User Identifiers**

When you access the Service, we use, access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “user identifiers.” User identifiers are small data files or similar data structure assigned to a user that will be used to enable you to continue in-game progress, use games across multiple platforms and help associate your identity across multiple platforms. A user identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A user identifier may remain persistently on your device or computer, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of user identifiers is impaired or disabled.

To the extent the processing of your Personal Information for this purpose is necessary to deliver the Service, and if and insofar as the GDPR applies, we rely on art. 6.1.(b) of the GDPR. To the extent that the processing of your Personal Information is required for our legitimate interest to better understand your use of the Service, and if and insofar as the GDPR applies, we rely on art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR.

**Location Data**

When you access the Service, we may use, access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include your geographic location, your physical location including your general geolocation and/or IP addresses. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service, in order to aid us in the provision of Services to you.

Your desktop or mobile device settings may allow you to disable or block location-based services, which will prevent our Services from accessing your location information. If you choose not to provide this information, you may not be provided with content specific to your location, and we or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. In addition, some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

**Data Collected To Prevent** **Unauthorized Use** **and Unauthorized Software**

When you run our Game software, this may involve software functions designed to detect unauthorized use of our Services or unauthorized and malicious programs. In this context, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store screenshots of game play, information relating to hardware capacity, modifications related to our Game software, signatures, profiles or names of known unauthorized or malicious third party programs, files or processes that enable or facilitate cheating, unfair advantage or hacking of the Games or Service. If unauthorized or malicious programs are detected, the Game software may also communicate to us the users account and User ID and information about the unauthorized or malicious program or its use.

We see this processing as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, in line with art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR. If and insofar as the GDPR applies, you have the right to object to this type of processing by contacting us as indicated above. In such case, we will carefully assess whether there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

**Information** **Collected** **in** **Console Games**

When you access to a console game on a console platform (such as PlayStation™ Network, Nintendo Switch™, Microsoft Xbox, etc.), we collect the following information automatically through your use of the Services: Internet Protocol (IP) address, log data (time and period), in-game items and behaviors, achievements you have completed in the game, other users you referred.

We also obtain information from third party sources. If you play our game on a network connected console of Sony, Sony may share with us your PSN Online ID, country, gender, age, "Friends" and block list in console platform. The sharing of such information by console platforms to us will be subject to the privacy policy of relevant console platforms:  PlayStation™ Network, Nintendo Switch™, and Microsoft Xbox.

From time to time we may change the information requested upon registration or with respect to certain features or Services, so this may not be a complete list.

You can access certain portions of our Service without providing us with any Personal Information. However, you will not be able to utilize certain features that require registration or receive materials unless certain information is provided. The processing of this Personal Information is lawful as it is necessary for the performance of our Service.

**Information Collected from Third-Party Sources**

In certain instances, we also collect certain information about you from third-party sources. For instance, for select giveaway promotions, we may obtain Personal Information about you such as your: first and last name, email address, city of residence, state/region, country, birthday, and social media usernames, handles, and identifiers.

**No Special Categories of Information**

We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” as defined in art. 9 of the GDPR, such as any information on health, race, religion, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences or orientation. We also want to kindly remind you to be cautious when sharing this information about yourself (or others) in our forums.

**3\. For What Other Purposes Do We Use Personal Information?**

In general, we use Personal Information we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or Services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or Services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Service, to better understand the needs of our visitors, and for the purpose for which the information was provided.

* Some processing activities are necessary for the performance of our Service, in line with art. 6.1.(b) of the GDPR (if, and to the extent that, it applies), for example: to provide the Services, products or information you request and to process any transactions in connection therewith;
* to permit you to interact with other members of the Service on our forum, chat, social media or other similar features;
* to provide technical support, customer service and ensure the continued smooth operation of our Service; or
* to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints.

Also, your information will be shared with us by Console Platform, including PSN Online ID, country, gender, age, "Friends" and block list in Console Platform. We will use such information to deliver the console games and Service to you. This processing is necessary for the performance of our Service in line with art. 6.1(b) of the GDPR (if, and to the extent that, it applies).

Other processing activities are necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, for example:

* to send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Service;
* to analyze user characteristics and usage patterns in order to better understand how our products and Service are used and market them more effectively;
* to send you newsletters, surveys, contest and sweepstakes announcements and to notify contest and sweepstakes winners;
* to request feedback, perform research and analysis and to enable us to operate, develop, customize and improve the Service, our publications; or
* to prevent or investigate actual or suspected fraud, hacking, infringement, or other misconduct involving the Service or any of our products and services.

In particular, in console games, we use your Personal Information to communicate with you, to improve our Services, and for other purposes including those set out below. We collect Internet Protocol (IP) address, log data (time and period), in-game items and behaviors, achievements you have completed in the game and other users you referred through your use of the Services. We will use such information to keep the record of your account and to improve the functionality of our Games and Services.

Furthermore, in order to offer you more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with us, information collected through one offering or portion of the Service may be combined with information obtained through other offerings or portions of the Service. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use Services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on IP address in order to customize certain Services to your geographic area.

If and insofar as the GDPR applies, you have the right to object to this processing based on our legitimate interests by contacting us as indicated above. In such case, we will carefully assess whether there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

Where processing is not necessary for the performance of the Service or we do not have legitimate interests or other legal basis are inapplicable, your consent to such processing will be requested as appropriate under applicable laws.

Insofar as the GDPR applies, we process Personal Information based on your consent, for example:

* to enable third parties to display advertising that is customized to your interests and preferences of the Service;
* to display content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences; or
* to contact you about our or a third party’s Services, products, activities, promotions, special events or offers and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes.

If you provide us Personal Information about others, you should make sure you have obtained their consent or have lawful basis to do this. In such case, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

**4\. Do We Share Personal Information?** **If So, How Do We Share Your Information?**

We will share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

**Our Service Providers**

We may share Personal Information with vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) such as our credit card processor and our Live Chat vendor who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Service and who need access to such information to carry out their services for us. We provide access to the information they may need to perform our Services under reasonable confidentiality terms. In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. We require Service Providers to only use Personal Information they obtain from us to provide the Services for us.

We may share your Personal Information with third party partners or Service Providers or allow such third party partners or Service Providers to collect information from you directly in order to provide services to us, including serving you targeted advertisements on or off the Service, provide offers, surveys or marketing messages or providing analytic services. Arc Games complies with the Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the EU, Switzerland, and the UK, including the provisions governing onward transfer liability. For example, we may use your contact details (such as email or phone number) in order to use Facebook's Custom Audiences, which enables Facebook to identify and advertise to you on our behalf on the Facebook platform.

We share Personal Information with third parties when you give us your consent to do so if it is required by applicable laws. For example, we may enter into relationships with other parties to make specific services or offers available directly to our users. If a user opts in to these third party services or marketing offers, for example by clicking through to a third party link, we may share the Personal Information you provide at the time of sign-up or other Personal Information about you, such as your name or other contact information, that we deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for our business partner to provide these services or offers or get in contact with you. If you no longer want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at [privacy@arcgames.com](mailto:privacy@arcgames.com).

**Our Subsidiaries**

We may share information with companies in the same group of companies as Arc Games, which includes our subsidiaries (i.e., any organization we own or control) or our ultimate holding company (i.e., any organization that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns. These companies will use your Personal Information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Policy.

We see this processing as necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, in line with art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR. If and insofar as the GDPR applies, you have the right to object to this type of processing by contacting us as indicated above. In such case, we will carefully assess whether there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

**Sharing In Response To Legal Obligations**

We may access, disclose or preserve Personal Information, including the content of your communications, in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized by public and governmental authorities, regulators or courts, or when required to do so, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Arc Games, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Arc Games or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Service. We may also disclose your Personal Information to any other third party with your prior consent if it is required by applicable laws.

**Publicly Available Information**

You understand that when you use the community features of our Service, information you post in public or private groups, forums, and other interactive areas of the Service, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Service, will be available to other users and in some cases (such as when you post to a public area of the Service) may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious in giving out Personal Information to others or sharing such information in public or private online forums. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share Personal Information. To request removal of your Personal Information from our community forums or other public areas, contact us at [privacy@arcgames.com](mailto:privacy@arcgames.com). Even if you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Sharing Due to Merger, Acquisition And Similar Situations Of The Transfer Of Company Assets**

Information we collect and process, including Personal Information, may also be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale, divestiture, or transfer of all or a portion of the company assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where Personal Information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Arc Games. You will be notified via email and/or a notice of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Information, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Information. For the processing of your Personal Information for this purpose, we rely on our legitimate interest to conduct our business in good faith, in line with art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR (if, and to the extent that, the GDPR applies).

Please note that nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.

**5\. International Transfers of Personal Information**

In order to be able to also use your account on our Website and in our Service and to be able to choose a server located in the United States or in Europe for gaming, the information relating to your account and use of our games is transferred between Arc Games Inc. located in the United States and Arc Games B.V. located in The Netherlands. We also transfer data outside Europe where our third-party Service Providers or partners are located.

If and insofar as the GDPR applies, in case such recipients are located in a third country for which the European Commission has not yet decided that it ensures an adequate level of protection and where derogations for specific situations do not apply, we shall implement appropriate safeguards with regard to the processing of your Personal Information. Where we rely on such appropriate safeguards for the transfer of your Personal Information, we will assess whether these safeguards can sufficiently protect your Personal Information so that the level of protection guaranteed in the European Union is not undermined by the transfer. If this is not the case, we will take the additional measures necessary to provide appropriate protection for your Personal Information. If it is not possible to provide for appropriate protection of your Personal Information, we will not transfer your Personal Information to the recipient in a third country, or will transfer your Personal Information only if and to the extent that another mechanism justifies the transfer of your Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection law. To obtain a copy of these data protection safeguards or to obtain information about their applicability, please send a request via email to [privacy@arcgames.com](mailto:privacy@arcgames.com).

**6\. Links to Third Party Sites**

Our Service contains links to other websites. Third party social media sites may log information about you, for example, if you click an “Add This” or “Like” button for a social media site while on our Website or Service. We do not control such sites or their activities. Any Personal Information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of websites to which we link. Links from our Service to third parties or to other sites are provided for your convenience only. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with Personal Information.

**7\. Hardware Capacity Communication**

You understand and agree that when you download a Game, in order to be able to use the Game, the Game software may monitor and communicate information from your computer relating to hardware capacity.

**8\. Performance Monitoring**

You understand and agree that when you communicate with other users within a game or utilize any interactive features available on the Service, such as instant messaging, forums or chat rooms, such communications and postings are transmitted through our servers, and we may, but are not obligated to, monitor all such communications and postings, including those that are designated as “private,” to the degree that laws and regulations enable us to do this. Therefore, as the abovementioned performance monitoring might involve access to these communications and postings, please do not use these communication channels for private messages or to exchange Personal Information.

This processing is based on our legitimate interest to keep our Service efficient and safe, in line with art. 6.1.(f) of the GDPR (if and to the extent that the GDPR applies).

**9\. What Steps Do We Take to Protect Personal Information Online?**

Arc Games endeavors to take reasonable precaution to safeguard and secure the Personal Information we collect through the Service. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or misuse of Personal Information. For example, Arc Games uses SSL (secured socket layer) technology to encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to us, such as account passwords, credit card numbers and other payment-related identifiable information).

In addition, we restrict internal access to Personal Information to employees who need the information to perform their duties. The unauthorized access or use of such information by an employee is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.

Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way as to block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no authority to access. You should note that our Service Providers may be responsible for processing, handling or storing some of the Personal Information that we receive. They are not authorized to market to you independently. These Service Providers are contractually required to safeguard and secure the Personal Information they received from us. Although we strive to protect your Personal Information, you should be aware, that information sent over the Internet is not completely secure and may be intercepted or accessed by third parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of such information, and we are not responsible or liable for any such interception.

If you have any questions about security on our Service, you can contact us at [privacy@arcgames.com](mailto:privacy@arcgames.com).

**10\. What Choices Do You Have Regarding the Use Of Your Personal Information?**
