**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Website or the Service (as defined in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.arcgames.com/en/about/privacy)) to enable the Website or the Service to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information.

If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser or mobile device’s instructions or help screen to learn about these functions. You may not be able to delete or disable cookies on certain mobile devices and/or certain browsers.
