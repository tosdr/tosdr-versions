For this Privacy Notice, **Access UK Ltd is the controller** of the personal data which is processed by it as a controller. Other Access Group entities may become a joint controller of your information from time to time.

Our Group Data Protection Officer is Danielle Hefford. To contact us regarding our use of personal data, you may email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.theaccessgroup.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

We have appointed Core Computer Consultants Ltd (registration number: 91755) as our EU representative under Article 27, EU GDPR. Our representative can be contacted by email at [\[email protected\]](https://www.theaccessgroup.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Why we have your information
----------------------------

We process personal data to fulfil our contractual obligations to our customers and to otherwise improve and market our solutions. There are various ways in which we may process your personal data. For example, because:

1. an organisation you work for uses one of our solutions;
2. an organisation you have engaged with uses our solutions to provide or otherwise make available a service to you;
3. you have used one of our solutions where we process your data in our capacity as data controller;
4. you have contacted us;
5. you work for us;
6. you visited our website;
7. your personal data was provided to us by a third party;
8. as a result of other lead-generating activities done by us;
9. here you sign up or are otherwise registered to one of our platforms;
10. you are a signatory to a contract with us;
11. you attended one of our Access led events; or
12. through the deployment of cookies (or similar technologies);
13. becuase you have provided feedback to us.

On what legal basis we have your information
--------------------------------------------

We will only ever process your personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so. We have expanded upon the reasons for us processing your personal data below.

### 1\. Where an organisation you work for uses one of our solutions

If you use our solutions through your employer, for example, our HR, Payroll, or eLearning solutions, then we will process your personal data as a processor (your employer is the controller).

We recommend you read your employer’s relevant privacy documentation for information explaining what personal data is collected, and what for, etc., Third parties may also process your personal data (on our behalf). The details of these third parties will be included in the contract we hold with the controller (your employer).

_See section “Further processing of your personal data” for what data we may process about you in our capacity as an independent controller._

### 2\. Where you have engaged with an organisation that uses one or more of our solutions

If you use our solutions via a third-party organisation; for example, to submit your CV to a recruitment agency, or to donate money on a charity’s website, then we will process your personal data as a processor (the relevant third-party organisation is the controller).

We recommend you read the third-party organisation’s relevant privacy documentation for information explaining what personal data is collected, and what for, etc.,

Some of our solutions have dedicated privacy notices, where this is the case, these are accessible via our [Security Portal](https://accessgroup.my.site.com/Support/s/login/) or alternatively, they may be accessible within the solution itself.

Third parties may also process your personal data (on our behalf). The details of these third parties will be included in the contract that we hold with the controller.

_See section “Further processing of your personal data” for what data we may process about you in our capacity as an independent controller._

### 3\. Where you have used one of our solutions where we process your data in our capacity as data controller

We provide a limited number of solutions where some or all your personal data is processed by the Access Group in its capacity as a controller. For example, DesignMyNight, sPROC, Adam Procure, Adam Housing and Class4Kids.

Where you use one or more of our Access Products and we process all your data in our capacity as controller, the relevant Access Product will make its own dedicated privacy notice available to you, **save for where one of the exceptions below applies:**

Where you are a “Provider” on SProc, Adam Procure or Adam Housing - a “Provider” meaning a user who has signed up to either SProc, Adam Procure and or Adam Housing to bid on opportunities, contract management and or payment purposes.

The lawful basis for collecting and sharing your information with Access Group customers who have procured services from you as a Provider is contractual, as the processing is necessary for the performance of the contract with you. Where the Access Group customer processes your information outside of the relevant solution, they are doing so as an independent controller of your information.

Where we use your information to market Access Group solutions which may be of interest to you, our lawful basis is legitimate interests. The legitimate interest pursued is to share service messages pertaining to the solution that is used, and to market Access Group solutions which may be of interest to you.

The information we will process for marketing purposes is limited to: business email address; business phone number; your name; company name; service category reference and which local authority you’re engaged with to provide services.

### 5\. Where you work for the Access Group

If you are an employee of ours, then we will process your personal data as a controller.

In addition to the above, we also act as an independent controller of a smaller subset of data, which we either may collect: (a) directly from you; (b) from the relevant solution(s) you are using; and or (c) through a third party, because you have been identified by us as a key contact pertaining to:

(a) financial matters – meaning we may contact you regarding the payment of invoices. Our lawful basis for processing this data is legitimate interests. The legitimate interest sought is the payment of invoices; and/or

Sharing your personal data
--------------------------

We may have to ad hoc share your personal data with regulators, law enforcement bodies, government agencies, courts or other third parties where we think it’s necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights.

We have also partnered with reputable third parties to provide a best-in-class service offering to you and our wider customer base (which may include the marketing of Access Group solutions or compatible solutions provided by the Access Group’s trusted partners). Where sharing your personal data with our trusted partners means a transfer to a third country (without an adequacy decision or adequacy regulations, as applicable) is to take place, we will ensure we put in place appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection (as compared to the UK and EU GDPR) to your personal data will be given.

We may also share your personal data with other members of the Access Group: we will only do this where we have a lawful basis for doing so, for example, **fulfilment of contract** or **legitimate interests.** Where the receiver of your personal data is an Access Group entity which is in a third country without an adequacy decision or adequacy regulation (as applicable), the transfer will be safeguarded by, at minimum, an intra-group agreement (which includes recognised model clauses and the UK’s IDTA).

Lastly, we may share your personal data with third parties in connection with a sale of the Access Group (or any part thereof). Where that divested entity becomes a controller of your information, they will supply or otherwise make available to you their relevant privacy notice.

Storage and disposal of your personal data
------------------------------------------

Where we have your personal data acting in our capacity as a **controller**, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention schedule (available via our [**Security Portal**](https://access-support.force.com/Support/s/gdpr-hub)), or as otherwise required by data protection legislation: including where you choose to exercise your rights as a data subject (see ‘Your Rights’ section for more information).
