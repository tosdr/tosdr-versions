#### REFUND POLICY

We request you send us a photo of the defective item within 24 hours from the time of delivery and we would refund the cost immediately after discussing with our shopper to improve future quality. For all pantry items, if the package is not open, please return within 30 days or your next delivery, which ever is sooner, for a full refund.

Cancellations

If you need to cancel your order, you can do it anytime online from your account before 11:00 AM on the scheduled delivery day by email. If you need to cancel your order after this time, please call customer support. We will try to accomodate your request. Sometimes we may not be able to cancel orders after this time as orders would've been sent out to shoppers and we cannot callback.
