To request a list of companies, if any, to which we have provided personal information for our own marketing purposes, please submit your request [via this form](https://www.insticator.com/5565-2/) or by postal mail to Insticator Inc., c/o Privacy Administrator, 2 Park Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York, 10016, Attn: Your California Shine the Light Privacy Rights. All requests must be labeled “Your California Shine the Light Privacy Rights” on the email subject line or envelope or post card. For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to “Your California Privacy Rights”, include your name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail).

You can always opt-out or unsubscribe by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.insticator.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by [filling out this form](https://www.insticator.com/5565-2/).
    
    California law also requires us to disclose how we respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals. We have not yet developed a response to “Do Not Track” signals sent by browsers, and do not change any of our data collection practices when we receive such signals. We will continue to evaluate potential responses to “Do Not Track” signals in light of industry developments or legal changes.
    
14. **Changes to Our Privacy Policy**. From time to time, we may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives, third party requirements or changes in the law, technology, our information processing practices or the features and functionality of the Services, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting. When we change this Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services after we post a revised Privacy Policy (and, where appropriate, notify you of same) signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. We may continue to process your information based on our legitimate interests or in order to fulfill our obligations under a contract and/or may also seek your affirmative consent to the terms of the updated Privacy Policy. For example, we may ask for your consent before implementing new uses of the personal data that we’ve already collected from you based on such consent, if such new use was not addressed by the privacy policy under which such information was collected or if our legal basis for processing such information changes. The Services (including the Widget) may be linked to, rely on and/or be integrated with websites, applications, interfaces, services and/or platforms operated by third-party companies, including service providers and Third Party Platforms. The Services may also feature advertisements from other third parties. Insticator is not responsible for the privacy practices of any websites, applications, interfaces, services and platforms operated by such third parties that are linked to, rely on and/or integrated with the Services, or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies. Once you leave the Services via such a link, access a third party application, interface, service, or platform, including Third Party Platforms and websites operated by service providers or third parties, or click on or navigate to an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of such third party to determine, among other things, how they will handle any information that they may collect from you.
15. **Contact Us.** In addition to the contact methods set forth above with respect to particular requests you may have, if you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, how we handle your personal data or any of the terms or conditions of this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at the addresses set forth below: By Email: [\[email protected\]](https://www.insticator.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)OR
