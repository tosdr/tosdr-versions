Finalsite Privacy Policy
========================

**Last Updated** **July 23, 2024**

We at Active Internet Technologies LLC, dba Finalsite, our affiliates and subsidiaries (“Finalsite”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, safeguard, share, and disclose your personal information in connection with our online services. It also explains your rights and choices with respect to your personal information. 

This Policy applies when you interact with our websites located at [https://www.finalsite.com/](https://www.finalsite.com/), [https://www.finalsitesupport.com/](https://www.finalsitesupport.com/), [https:training.finalsite.com](https://www.finalsite.com/training.finalsite.com) and any other websites, pages, features or content we own or operate (collectively, the “Site(s)”); when, as a subscriber to our service, you use services available through our online Finalsite platform (the “Platform”) and when you use our other products or services that direct you to this Policy (collectively, including the Sites and the Platform the “Service(s)”).

Please read this entire Policy to make sure that you fully understand it. By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy, and you agree to the accompanying Terms and Conditions. Our Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern all use of our Services, and together with the Privacy Policy, constitute your agreement with us. If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any part of this Policy or the Terms, please immediately discontinue access or use of our Services.

In providing our Services to subscribers of our Platform (“Clients”), Finalsite is a data processor as we process personal information on behalf and at the direction of the Clients. This Policy does not apply to Finalsite’s processing when it is a data processor. If you have submitted  personal information to a Client through a website or a mobile application powered by us, you should directly contact that Client for assistance with any requests or questions relating to the processing of your personal information.

We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time. If we make a change to this Policy that we believe materially changes how we use your personal information or reduces your rights, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page.

1\. Personal Information We Collect 
------------------------------------

Finalsite collects certain personal information about you and your use of our Services. The definition of personal information (used interchangeably with “personal data” for European residents) depends on the applicable law based on your physical location. Only the definition that applies to your physical location will apply to you under this Policy. The personal information that Finalsite collects falls into three primary categories: (1) information you voluntarily provide to us, (2) information we collect from you automatically, and (3) information we collect from third parties.

**Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us**. We, or service providers that assist us in providing, maintaining, and operating our Services, may collect the following types of personal information from you:

1. **Web Forms.** We may collect your name, email, school information and phone number when you request demos, free website reports, free consultations, or would like to get in touch with us for other matters. Personal information that you provide by email or web forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information to you or respond to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, we may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level of interest in, or satisfaction with our services.  
     
2. **Event and Training Registration.** If you register for a Finalsite event or would like to participate in a training course, we may request certain personal information from you on our order form. We may ask you to provide contact information (such as name, email, school information, job title, role, organization name) and, for chargeable events, financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes for event registration or to contact you if we have difficulty processing your order.  
     
3. **Customer Service.** When you engage with our support team, we may collect records, copies of your correspondence (including email addresses), and any additional information you choose to share with us.  
     
4. **Professional Materials.** We periodically offer content in the form of e-books, guides and free courses that might be useful to school professionals. In order to view these contents, we may ask you to provide your name, email, role, school information and country information.  
     
5. **Testimonials.** Our client contracts include client permission to post testimonials, both written and video, on our website. Permission to display client reference information (name, school, phone number) is obtained from our clients prior to displaying them on our site. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [privacy@finalsite.com](mailto:privacy@finalsite.com).  
     
6. **Blog and Forums.** We offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request the removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us at [privacy@finalsite.com](mailto:privacy@finalsite.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Additionally, when you subscribe to our blog and would like to receive periodical updates, we may collect your name, email and role.  
     
7. **Surveys.** Occasionally we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our Sites. If you participate, we may request certain personal information from you. Participation in these surveys is entirely voluntary. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our services and product offerings.

**Information We Automatically Collect.** To the extent permitted under the applicable law, we may collect certain types of information automatically, such as whenever you interact with the Sites or use the Services. We may collect the following types of information automatically from you:

1. **Usage Data.** When you browse our Sites, we automatically collect log data such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the date and time you access our servers, and other diagnostic data.   
     
2. **Device Information.** When you use your desktop or mobile devices to access our Services, we may be able to identify your device’s unique device identifier, MAC address, operating system, and your mobile device’s advertising ID.  
     
3. **Location Information.** When you use our Services, we may infer the generic physical location and geographic regions of your device from your Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other device settings. For example, your IP address may indicate your general geographic region. You may choose not to share your location details with us by adjusting your mobile or desktop device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.

**_Information We Collect From Third Parties._** From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third-party sources as required or permitted by law. These sources may include:
