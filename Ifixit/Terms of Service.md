Apology
-------

We're sorry it's necessary to have this here, and that it's so long, and especially that some of it is SHOUTING IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. Someday, maybe we can all get together on a beautiful beach with a nice bonfire and all agree on everything and sing Kumbaya and burn these overly long terms-of-service agreements. But until then, this is what our lawyers suggested we say.

[](#Section_Big_Letters "Link to this section")

[](#Section_Guide_Content_and_Photographs "Link to this section")

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

IN NO EVENT WILL IFIXIT, NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES ARISING FROM (A) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, OR (B) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO THE SITE AND USE OF THE SERVICE, (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) US$10.

[](#Section_Indemnification "Link to this section")

Indemnification
---------------

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless iFixit, its affiliates and each of its, and its affiliates’ employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses, that arise from (i) your use or misuse of, or access to, the Service; (ii) your violation of the Terms of Use; or, (iii) the infringement by you, or any third party using your account, of any intellectual property, privacy, publicity or other right of any person or entity. iFixit reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with iFixit in asserting any available defenses. This obligation survives indefinitely the termination and/or expiration of these Terms of Use and/or your status as a iFixit User.

[](#Section_International_Use "Link to this section")

International Use
-----------------

iFixit makes no representation that the Content is appropriate or available for use in locations outside of the United States, and accessing the Service is prohibited from territories where such Content is illegal. If you access the Service from other locations, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

[](#Section_Dispute_Resolution "Link to this section")

Dispute Resolution
------------------

A printed version of the Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You and iFixit agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.

The Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and all applicable federal laws.

ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO USE OF THIS SITE OR SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH CONFIDENTIAL AND BINDING MEDIATION. A mediator appointed by the parties will assist in attempting to resolve the dispute. Each party acts in an individual capacity and not as part of a class. The mediator may not consolidate claims of more than one party, or preside over any class proceeding. If the parties are unable to agree on a settlement, the mediator will act as an arbitrator to resolve the issue(s) on which the parties fail to agree and will impose a final and binding resolution on the parties with the effect of an arbitration decision. The mediator's final and binding resolution will constitute an arbitration award and will be enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act.

You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for enforcing this binding mediation agreement, or any litigation arising in the event this binding mediation agreement is held to be unenforceable, will be only the state or federal courts located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and you further agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Use, including without limitation, this section.

BY USING THIS SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE BINDING MEDIATION AGREEMENT, AND YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND A CLAIM IN COURT AND YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING.

[](#Section_Miscellaneous "Link to this section")

Miscellaneous
-------------

The Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and iFixit with respect to the Service and use of this Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and iFixit with respect to this Site or any other of the subject matter hereof. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No failure of iFixit or the Site to enforce any of its rights under these Terms of Use will act as a waiver of such rights. The Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with iFixit's prior written consent. iFixit may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. All notices under the Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Unless otherwise indicated, the Terms of Use and all Content provided by iFixit are copyright iFixit, all rights reserved. iFixit, and the iFixit logo, as well as any other logos or brand features owned by iFixit, are trademarks or service marks of iFixit or otherwise proprietary to iFixit. The names of actual companies and products mentioned on the Site may be the trademarks or service marks of their respective owners.
