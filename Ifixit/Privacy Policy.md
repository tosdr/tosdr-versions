#### Cookies

Our website uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that your browser automatically creates and stores on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, PC, etc.) when you visit our website. Cookies cause no damage to your device and do not contain viruses or other malware. The cookie stores information which is created in connection with the specific device you are using. However, this does not mean that we immediately become aware of your identity. Cookies are mainly used to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure.

We use session cookies to recognize that you have already visited individual pages of our website. These cookies also provide certain functionalities. Session cookies are deleted after you leave our website.

In addition, we also use temporary cookies, which are stored on your device for a specified period of time, to optimize user-friendliness and the statistical evaluation of the use of our website. If you visit our website again to use our services, these cookies will automatically recognize that you have already visited us before and what entries and settings you have made, so you do not have to enter them again.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, if you do not wish to accept cookies, you can configure your browser to prevent cookies from being stored on your device or so that a message always appears before a new cookie is created. A general objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared for many of the services, for example, at [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) or [the opt-out page of the Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/).

#### Contact Form

If you use the contact form, you will be asked to provide your name and email address so we can contact you personally. Additional information can be provided voluntarily. All personal data collected in connection with the contact form will be deleted after responding to your request, unless it is necessary to store this data for the documentation of other processes (for example, for the subsequent conclusion of a contract).

[](#Section_Newsletter "Link to this section")

If you would like to receive our newsletter, we need to have your name and email address. Your email address will be used and stored for this purpose until you withdraw your consent or unsubscribe from the newsletter. You can unsubscribe at any time by using the link at the end of each newsletter or by contacting us.

We send our newsletters with a web beacon. A web beacon is a miniature graphic embedded in the newsletter’s HTML format which enables us to analyze reader behavior. In this context, we store whether and at what time a newsletter was opened by you and which of the links contained in the newsletter were accessed by you. We use this data to create statistical evaluations of the success or failure of a marketing campaign in order to optimize newsletter distribution and to better match the content of future newsletters to your interests.

If you leave comments or other contributions on our website, your email and IP address will be stored. You can provide further information voluntarily. The purpose of storing your email address is to contact you regarding your comment or contribution, to forward any complaints you may have and, if necessary, to ask you to comment. You will not be able to use the comments function without entering your email address. The email address you provide will be saved but will not be published along with your comment.

Our legitimate interest in retrieving and storing your email address is for security reasons, for example, in the event that someone leaves illegal content (for example, insults) in comments and contributions. In this case, we ourselves could be prosecuted for the comment or contribution and therefore, we have a legitimate interest in storing your IP address.

[](#Section__Creditworthiness_and_Scoring "Link to this section")

#### **Creditworthiness and Scoring**

We perform a credit assessment (automated decision-making) of customers to check creditworthiness and minimize payment defaults. This is done if purchase order, money order, credit card or direct debit is selected as the payment method. For this purpose, the customer’s name, address, IP, and partial credit card will be transmitted to: Signifyd, Inc., 2540 N. First Street, Suite 300, San Jose, CA 95131. The credit assessment involves the use of probability values (score values), whose calculation includes address data. The calculation of these scoring values is based on a scientifically recognized mathematical-statistical procedure. Additional information on how Signifyd handles your personal data can be found in the [Signifyd Privacy Policy](https://www.signifyd.com/privacy/). In case of insufficient creditworthiness, purchase order, money order, credit card or direct debit will not be accepted as a payment method. If you do not agree to the data transfer, please use another method of payment.

[](#Section__Payment_Services "Link to this section")

#### **Payment Services**

PayPal acts as an online payment service provider and trustee and offers buyer and seller protection services. When paying via PayPal, credit card via PayPal, direct debit via PayPal or, if offered, purchase on account via PayPal, your name, email address, purchased products, invoice amount, as well as your invoice and delivery address will be transferred to PayPal as part of payment processing. When using the following payment methods: credit card via PayPal, direct debit via PayPal or, if offered, purchase on account via PayPal, PayPal may conduct a credit check in order to check your creditworthiness and to minimize payment defaults before deciding to approve the payment process. The credit assessment involves the use of probability values (score values), whose calculation includes address data. The calculation of these scoring values is based on a scientifically recognized mathematical-statistical procedure. In case of insufficient creditworthiness PayPal can refuse the chosen payment method.

If you do not agree with the data transmission, or if you believe that your creditworthiness is not suitable for the chosen method of payment, please use another method of payment. Additional information on how PayPal handles your personal information can be found in [PayPal’s Privacy Statement](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full).

[](#Section__Facebook_Pixel "Link to this section")

#### **Facebook Pixel**

We use the “Facebook Pixel” on our website. The use of this technology enables Facebook to assign visitors to our website to specific groups (for example, visitors to our website according to the areas of interest we have sent to Facebook - the “custom audiences”) for the display of specific advertisements and to thus be able to recognize these groups. This ensures that these users are only shown advertisements that match their interests and that inconveniences caused by inappropriate advertising are avoided. By using the Facebook Pixel, we can also monitor the effectiveness of our Facebook advertisements for statistical purposes and track whether and how a user has used our services after clicking on an advertisement.

Additional information about the Facebook Pixel and how it works can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616). Detailed information on how Facebook processes the data it collects and general information about Facebook advertisements can be found in [Facebook’s Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php). In your Facebook account under the heading “Settings,” you can object to the collection of your data via the Facebook Pixel and its use for displaying specific advertisements. Information on these settings can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads) (login necessary).

This website uses the “demographic features” function as part of Google Analytics. This function allows us to generate reports that contain information about the age, gender and interests of our site visitors. This data comes from Google’s interest-based advertising and from visitor data from third-party providers.

This website uses Google Analytics Remarketing from Google. Google Analytics Remarketing is used to present advertisements to visitors that refer to the content of previously visited websites.

This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf or Google. You can prevent the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website.

This website uses Google AdSense to display advertisements on our website. Google AdSense uses cookies and web beacons to recognize and analyze your visit to the site. Web beacons are small invisible graphics that analyze information, such as clicks on advertisements and website traffic. This service collects your IP address, which of our web pages you have visited and, if applicable, other data Google needs for the provision of the advertisements.

This website uses external fonts from Google, web fonts, to display fonts. In order to do this, your browser loads the required web font into the browser cache when you access the web page. If your browser does not support this function, your computer will use a standard font to display the website.

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

**_Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_**

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, and

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

**_Response Timing and Format_**

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

[](#Section__California_Do_Not_Track_Disclosure "Link to this section")

#### **California Do Not Track Disclosure**

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created. For information about DNT, visit [All About DNT](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/).
