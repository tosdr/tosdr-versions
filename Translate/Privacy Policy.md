* We ensure that all the relevant data is subject to regular backups and also regularly check them to ensure that the data can be successfully retrieved.

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

You agree to (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you log out from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Service. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.

**Modifications to Service**

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

**Use and Storage**

You acknowledge that we may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum period of time that documents, data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be allotted on our servers on your behalf. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any documents, data or other content maintained or uploaded by the Service. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that we reserve the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice.

**User Conduct**

You are solely responsible for all documents, information, data, text, images, software, photographs, graphics, messages or other materials ("content") that you upload, post, publish or display (hereinafter, "upload") or email or otherwise use via the Service. We reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates this provision, including without limitation, removing the offending content from the Service, suspending or terminating the account of such violators and reporting you to the law enforcement authorities. You agree to not use the Service to:

* email or otherwise upload any content that (i) infringes any intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any party; (ii) you do not have a right to upload under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (iii) contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of the Site; (iv) poses or creates a privacy or security risk to any person; (v) constitutes unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, commercial activities or any other form of solicitation; (vi) is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, excessively violent, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; or (vii) in the sole judgment of Translate.com, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Service, or which may expose Translate.com or its users to any harm or liability of any type;
* interfere with or disrupt the Site, Service or servers or networks connected to the Site or Service;
* violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, or any regulations having the force of law;
* impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;
* harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of other users;
* promote criminal activity;
* obtain or attempt to access any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Service.

**Fees & Payment**

Payment may be required in order to use some aspects of our Service. Payments will be processed through a third-party credit card processor and you agree to abide by its terms policies.

You agree to pay us the amount that is specified in the Service in accordance with the terms available on the Pricing Page of the Site. We offer various plans which allow you to choose what works best for you.

In any case your payment for our Service cannot be less than the minimum one. The minimum payment is the lowest amount of money you are required to pay for an order that would be charged from your bank account. Our minimum payment rates reflect the terms and conditions of payment providers and their commission fees, as well as the amount of effort required to complete your order. Currently minimum payments are as follows:

* $5 for the translation of files with 166 words or less in the following formats: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .rtf, .xliff .csv .xls .po .indd .idml .ai .fig;
* $ 4.5 for the translation of texts via the order form on the Website, as well as files in .txt, .json formats, that contain 50 words or less;
* $ 0.5 for orders via the translation API and Zendesk Translation App.

Orders in excess of the above minimal thresholds are calculated using the formula: price per one word x number of words.

You should always check the pricing page of the Site for the current rates before submitting an order as our pricing policy is subject to change.

Depending on the plan you choose, we may bill you monthly based on the number of words translated, or may bill you when your account hits a specified amount as defined on our Pricing Page. A plan may include a limited number of translated words and therefore an additional charge may be applied for overages which may be billed monthly or when the account reaches a specified amount. We reserve the right to change our prices, including minimum payments, and will provide notice of the change on the Site. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on our net income.

**Your plan shall automatically renew for subsequent periods of the same length as the initial term unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the then-current term. For example, if you are on a monthly plan, you will be automatically charged each month until you provide us notice you do not wish to continue the service. If you cancel in the middle of the month, you will not be entitled to a refund for the remainder of the month. If you pay for an annual plan, you will be automatically renewed for another year on your renewal date. If you do not wish to renew your plan, please provide us notice of your intention.**

If you make any major changes to an order which is already in progress, you might be required to pay for the work already performed with the respect to that order.

You are entitled to rollover any remaining unused Services during the term of your plan and 30 (thirty) calendar days after its termination. This provision applies solely to the business clients that pay on the basis of a plan.

**Delivery** **& Acceptance of Translations**

The delivery date on the Site shall be provisional provided for information purposes. We will notify you immediately if we are unable to meet a specified deadline.

All dates provided for the delivery and completion of Translations are approximate and not guaranteed. Time is not of the essence for delivery or performance, and no delay shall entitle you to reject delivery of the Service or a Translation. We will not be liable in any circumstances for the consequences of any delay in delivery or performance of the Service. All risk in the Translations shall pass to you.

In the event that you are not satisfied with our Service, you may submit a support ticket within 72 hours of receiving the product and we will redo the agreed upon translation. If you do not accept or reject a Translation within 72 hours of being notified of its completion, it will automatically be accepted.

**Intellectual Property Rights**

**Service Content, Software and Trademarks:**

You acknowledge and agree that the Service may contain content or features (collectively "Intellectual Property") protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by Translate.com, you agree not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the Service or the Intellectual Property, in whole or in part, except that the foregoing does not apply to your own Content that you legally upload to the Service. In connection with your use of the Service you will not engage in or use any data mining, robots, scraping or similar data gathering or extraction methods.
