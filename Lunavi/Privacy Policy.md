**Privacy Disclosure**

Your privacy is extremely important to us and we are committed to safeguarding any information that we collect or that you provide. Lunavi will not disclose information about Visitors without express permission or unless required by government subpoena.

**Information Collection Practices**

Information is obtained through analysis of server logs and through the use of cookies placed on Visitor's machines. A cookie is a very small text file that we use to help track the number of unique Visitors to our website, whether or not those Visitors are repeat Visitors, and the source of the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read them and personal information cannot be gathered from them.
