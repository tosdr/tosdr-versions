(the "Company," "StyleSeat," "we" or "us") at and through the website StyleSeat.com (the "Website") and through mobile applications (such services, applications and the Website are collectively referred to as the "Services"). The Company's Privacy Policy located at [https://www.styleseat.com/privacy](https://www.styleseat.com/privacy) and the StyleSeat Programs located at [http://mss.styleseat.com/clientprograms/](http://mss.styleseat.com/clientprograms/), as well as any community guidelines or dispute resolution procedures that the Company may provide or make available, are all considered part of these Terms of Service and are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service in their entirety. Any reference to these Terms of Service shall include and mean a reference to all such incorporated policies, guidelines, programs, schedules and processes. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Service and any other terms posted on the Website, the terms of these Terms of Service shall govern, and in the event of a conflict between these Terms of Service and the End User License Agreement in mobile applications (the "EULA"), the terms of the EULA shall govern.

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN STYLESEAT AND YOU WHICH GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF AND AGREEMENT TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND YOUR REPRESENTATION THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. IF YOU OBJECT TO ANYTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.

If you are accepting these Terms of Service and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant to StyleSeat that you have full power and authority to do so.

StyleSeat may update or change these Terms of Service from time to time and recommends that you review the Terms of Service on a regular basis as posted on StyleSeat’s website. You understand and agree that your continued use of the Services after the Terms of Service have changed constitutes your acceptance of the Terms of Service as revised.

The Services are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the Services, or any portion of them, may result in severe civil and criminal penalties, and will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible under the law. The Services are licensed, not sold.

The StyleSeat Services
----------------------

StyleSeat is a platform that connects salons, merchants, stylists and professionals (collectively or individually, "Professionals") providing hair, beauty and other health and wellness services ("Styling Services") with clients seeking such services ("Clients" or "you"). The Professionals and Clients are both users of the Services provided by StyleSeat and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users."

StyleSeat solely provides a platform for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Styling Services. StyleSeat does not provide or contract for Styling Services, and Professionals and Clients contract independently for the provision of Styling Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Styling Services to be provided and the location at which Styling Services will be performed, whether on the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. When Professionals create accounts with StyleSeat, Professionals certify to StyleSeat that they are a licensed professional, or if the Professional is a salon, merchant or other business entity, that each of such Professional's employees, independent contractors or agents who are providing Styling Services are licensed professionals, are legally able to provide the Styling Services they offer to Clients on our Website, and that their business information is correctly represented on StyleSeat. However, any decision by a Client to receive Styling Services or by a Professional to provide Styling Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and Professionals.

In addition, StyleSeat does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Styling Services provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. StyleSeat makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Styling Services offered or provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional. StyleSeat reserves the right to remove or hide any incorrect, out of date, or illegal information from any profile, as well as remove or hide entire profiles at any time. You understand that StyleSeat does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. StyleSeat does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Styling Services on the Services. StyleSeat does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, StyleSeat may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not StyleSeat conducts a background check or first party interview on a Professional, each Client must decide whether a Professional is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

Although the Services are intended to provide a Professional's availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the Professional to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the Services is not a guarantee that the Professional will honor the reservation as scheduled. StyleSeat cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User.

You must use your true and accurate name when signing up for an Account. You are required to select an appropriate and non-offensive Account ID. Ideally, the Account ID you choose will be a reasonably descriptive name that clearly identifies you. We reserve the right to remove or reclaim any Account ID if we believe, in our sole discretion, the Account ID is inappropriate, offensive or confusing or potentially violates the rights of a third party (such as when a trademark owner provides notice that an Account ID is similar to the trademark and the Account ID does not closely relate to the User's actual name or trademark rights).

### Your Account

As part of the functionality of the Services, you may link your Account with online accounts you may have with third party service providers (each such account, a "Third Party Account") by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information through the Services; or (ii) allowing StyleSeat to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to StyleSeat and/or grant StyleSeat access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating StyleSeat to pay any fees or making StyleSeat subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting StyleSeat access to any Third Party Accounts, you understand that (i) StyleSeat may access, make available and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third Party Account (the "SNS Content") so that it is available on and through the Services via your Account, including without limitation any friend lists, and (ii) StyleSeat may submit and receive additional information to your Third Party Account to the extent you are notified when you link your Account with the Third Party Account. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Service, all SNS Content, if any, shall be considered to be Content (as defined below) for all purposes of these Terms of Service. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the Services. Please note that if a Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or StyleSeat's access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content may no longer be available on and through the Services. You will have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

In addition, StyleSeat will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Services, you expressly relieve StyleSeat from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.

You acknowledge and agree that the Services may access your e-mail address book associated with a Third Party Account and your contacts list stored on your mobile device or tablet computer solely for the purposes of identifying and informing you of those contacts who have also registered to use the Services. At your request made via contacting us at [help.styleseat.com](http://help.styleseat.com/), StyleSeat will deactivate the connection between the StyleSeat Services and your Third Party Account and any information stored on StyleSeat's servers that was obtained through such Third Party Account will be hidden, except the username and profile picture associated with your Account.

Fees and Payments
-----------------

### Booking and Other Fees

StyleSeat charges Clients a booking fee for each appointment booked in order to cover the operational costs of providing a smooth booking experience. We charge a booking fee whether the appointment is booked by you or by the applicable Professional. If the appointment is booked by a Professional, you will receive an email confirmation with the booking fee listed. If you cancel your appointment, the booking fee is not refunded.

Professionals may require you to provide a Card or other payment information. If you cancel or don't show up for an appointment, your Card may still be charged in accordance with the cancellation policy of such Professional posted on the Professional's StyleSeat page at the time of your booking, at the Professional's discretion.

StyleSeat may from time to time, either as a StyleSeat Program (described in Section 6 below) or otherwise, provide certain services to Users for an additional fee that may, among other things, enable Professionals and Clients to connect more easily. A description of such StyleSeat Programs in effect as of today is located at http://mss.styleseat.com/clientprograms/.

If applicable, you agree to pay the applicable fees listed on our Fee Schedule available at http://mss.styleseat.com/clientprograms/, for use of the Services ("Fees"). Subject to the terms of these Terms of Service, we reserve the right to change our Fees immediately upon notice. You must agree to the change in Fees to continue to use the Services. To withdraw your consent, you will need to close your Account. All balances and all Fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Services are denominated in US dollars.

### Payments and Payment Service Providers

The Services allow Clients to pay and Professionals to accept payments, including payments initiated with Cards (defined below). StyleSeat facilitates the processing of such payments, which means that we collect, analyze and relay information generated in connection with these payments.

Payments made through the Services are processed through a third party payment service provider ("PSP") retained by the Company, which may include Stripe. Users will be required to provide Card or bank account details to the Company and the PSP (through the Services and/or via other means, including providing a physical card). By providing your payment information when requested, you authorize StyleSeat and its PSP (or the applicable Professional and its payment processors) to charge and process the fees and charges assessed in connection with your reservations (including any Styling Service fees, booking fees, out of pocket expenses owed to a Professional, and any tip or gratuity, if applicable) in accordance with these Terms of Service and any policy described on the Professional's StyleSeat page at the time of your booking.

As a condition of StyleSeat enabling payment processing services through the PSP, you agree to provide StyleSeat accurate and complete information about you, and you authorize StyleSeat to share such information and any other transaction information related to your use of the PSP services. While StyleSeat takes what it believes to be reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information to third parties who assess and process payments, StyleSeat is not responsible for any fees or charges assessed by third parties or any errors in the processing of payments by third parties, including any errors that result from third-party negligence, improper transmission of payment information, your mistaken submission of payment information, or your submission of erroneous payment information.

Users may be required to register with the PSP, agree to a PSP Account Agreement and the Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Please note that the Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that the Company has no obligations or liability to any User under the PSP Agreement.

When the PSP is Stripe, you are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the "Stripe Services Agreement"). By agreeing to these terms or continuing to use the Services, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of StyleSeat enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide StyleSeat accurate and complete information about you, and you authorize StyleSeat to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

You may have the option to pay using Klarna. Klarna will provide you with specific payment terms. For further information or questions regarding your payment please visit [Klarna's website](https://www.klarna.com/us/) or contact [Klarna's customer service](https://www.klarna.com/us/customer-service/).

Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (i) place on hold any payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.

StyleSeat facilitates the payment transaction per these Terms of Service between you and each Professional, but is not responsible for mediating any resulting disputes. StyleSeat has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by StyleSeat, in each case in StyleSeat's sole discretion. We are not a bank and we do not offer banking services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury.

### Accepted Cards

StyleSeat works with any US-issued and most non-US issued credit, debit, prepaid, or gift cards ("Cards") with a Visa, MasterCard, or Discover logo (collectively, the "Networks"). We may remove or add Cards that we accept at any time without prior notice. We will generally only process Cards that receive an authorization from the applicable Network and Card issuer.

### Unauthorized or Illegal Use

We may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe in our sole discretion that the transaction is in violation of these Terms of Service or any other StyleSeat agreement, or that it exposes Professionals, other StyleSeat Users, the PSP or StyleSeat to harm. Harm includes fraud and other criminal acts as determined by StyleSeat in our sole discretion. If we reasonably suspect that your Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement. We may also request information (including, but not limited to, information about services received, identity verification, and proof of authorized payment) from you at any time for any reason or no reason as part of internal ongoing reviews of transactions and accounts on our Services, and in particular, to assist in investigations of suspicious transactions and/or accounts. You hereby agree to provide us with such information and assistance in a timely manner and acknowledge that payment processing in connection with a suspicious transaction and/or account may be delayed to the Professional until such transaction and/or account has been cleared by StyleSeat, in its sole discretion. If you do not comply with StyleSeat’s request for information and assistance pursuant to this Section (xv), StyleSeat reserves the right to refund the payment back to the original card and/or prohibit you from processing any additional payments through the Services until you have provided such requested information and assistance and are cleared by StyleSeat. If your access to or use of the Services has been restricted or terminated by StyleSeat, you may not register a new StyleSeat account or attempt to access and use the Services through the StyleSeat account of another User.

Customer Care
-------------

Professionals, as a separate entity from StyleSeat, are solely responsible for all customer service issues relating to such Professional's goods or services, including without limitation, any Styling Services, pricing, order fulfillment, order or appointment cancellation, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates, functionality and warranty, and feedback concerning experiences with such Professional, any personnel, their policies or processes. As between Clients and StyleSeat, StyleSeat is solely responsible for customer service issues relating to any Account, payment, Card processing, debiting or crediting.

Professional's Loyalty Programs
-------------------------------

Professionals may offer loyalty programs to Clients. If a Professional offers such a loyalty program, the Professional (and not StyleSeat) is responsible for ensuring that its program and any associated rewards are compliant with applicable federal and state laws, including laws governing prepaid cards and special offers such as rebates and coupons. The Professionals agree to make available to Clients any terms and conditions applicable to such Professional's loyalty program.

StyleSeat Programs
------------------

The Company may from time to time provide certain programs, promotions, opportunities, sweepstakes and contests to Users ("StyleSeat Programs"); if you choose to take part in these StyleSeat Programs, additional terms can be found at [https://mss.styleseat.com/get-new-clients/.](https://mss.styleseat.com/get-new-clients/), StyleSeat reserves the right to change the terms of StyleSeat Programs at any time on notice to you, provided that any such changes shall not affect you retroactively.

### Gift Cards

StyleSeat may offer gift cards that Client can use to purchase Styling Services from a specific Professional ("Gift Cards"). StyleSeat offers this service as a convenience to Professionals and Clients and is not the merchant of record of any Gift Card, nor is it responsible for any matter in connection with redemption of any Gift Card. StyleSeat prohibits Clients from reloading Gift Cards via the Services and paying for Gift Cards with other Gift Cards. Gift Cards are not reloadable and may not be redeemed for cash (except, as between you and the applicable Professional, as may be required by law). Neither StyleSeat nor Professional is responsible for any lost or stolen Gift Cards or use without Client’s permission. StyleSeat reserves the right to limit quantities of Gift Cards purchased by any person or entity and to deactivate, cancel or suspend a Gift Card if it believes that the Gift Card was obtained through fraudulent, unlawful or improper means. Vouchers, coupons and other discounts may not be used to purchase Gift Cards. The Gift Card is not a credit, debit, or charge card. Gift Card users must be 18 years of age or older. All Gift Card purchases are processed through StyleSeat’s standard payment processing system, as described in Section 3.

Dispute Resolution
------------------

### Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Service ("Dispute"), you and StyleSeat agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to StyleSeat. StyleSeat's address for such notices is StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401.

### Binding Arbitration

If you and StyleSeat are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org.](https://www.styleseat.com/www.adr.org), Your arbitration fees and your share or arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed USD 10,000, StyleSeat will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, you and StyleSeat may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

### Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution.

Claims where mandatory arbitration is prohibited by a valid, non-preempted law, including claims under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, California Labor Code 2698 et seq. ("PAGA") to the extent waiver of such claim is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, are not covered by this arbitration provision. Nothing in this arbitration provision will prevent either party from bringing an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.

### Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding.

You and StyleSeat agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between StyleSeat and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND STYLESEAT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and StyleSeat otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

### Location of Arbitration.

Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California. You and StyleSeat agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

### Right to Opt out of Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.

You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision of these Terms of Service by **notifying StyleSeat in writing within 30 days of the date your first registered for the Services or a Subscription or 30 days from the date these Terms of Service were last updated** . To opt out, you must send a written notification to StyleSeat at StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401, that includes (a) your user identification, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver sections.

Governing Law
-------------

You and StyleSeat agree that, other than as set forth under the subsection entitled "Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding" in Section 13 above, if any portion of Section 13 entitled "Dispute Resolution" is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of these Terms of Service will be given full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the subsection entitled "Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution" in Section 13 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, neither you or StyleSeat will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of that subsection that is found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco, California, and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Except as expressly provided otherwise, these Terms of Service are governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.
