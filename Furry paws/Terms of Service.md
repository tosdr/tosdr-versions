### Modifications

Last modified on 12/11/23. Recent changes to the Terms of Service are highlighted.

### Introduction

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully. They contain the legal terms and conditions that govern game play provided to you by Furry Paws, including information, text, images, graphics, data or other materials ("Content") , products and services provided through http://www.furry-paws.com ( FP ), and software, programs and code forming or incorporated in to http://www.furry-paws.com (the "Game"). Furry Paws ("www.furry-paws.com", "FP", "site") is owned privately by me ("I"). FP is an online dog simulation comprised of fake kennels, fake dogs, fake shows, fake shops, and many more fake things, intended for use by those at least 13 years of age or older. Anyone who is under the age of 13 must first obtain the permission of a parent or guardian before signing up for or playing FP.

By using our Game, you agree to be bound by Section I of these Terms ("General Terms"), which contains provisions applicable to all users of our Game which apply to everyone, "basic" accounts and "elite" accounts alike. If you choose to log into Furry Paws, you will be expected to have read, and agree to be bound by, the additional terms set forth in Section II of these Terms ("Additional Terms").

I try to keep FP as clean as possible, but please note that there are certain areas of the site that are determined strictly by user ("member"), defined as someone who has signed up for an account on FP, input, hence, I cannot always control everything that goes on the site. Therefore, FP will not accept any responsibility for the distress that some of the aforementioned areas might hold.

Furry Paws will be enforcing a ZERO TOLERANCE SCAMMING POLICY. If a player is found to be attempting to maliciously and/or knowingly collect funds (real life or in-game) and/or taking credit for work that is not theirs, they will be at risk of having their account immediately frozen.

### Section I: General Terms

#### 1\. Availability

FP reserves the right to shut down at any time for any length of time or permanently without any warning or reason given. In other words, if I decide to close down FP, I can. If I decide to close FP for a while for renovations, bug fixes, anything else, or no reason at all, I can. You agree that Furry Paws is not and will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Game.

#### 2\. Privacy

Furry Paws ("FP", "site") obtains a user's IP address, user agent, and email. FP uses the IP address and user agent information to track users on the site, and the email address to send account notices and password retrieval help.

FP uses "cookies" for several purposes, including personalizing a user's experience, allowing a user to stay logged in, and tracking a user between multiple accounts.

FP will not distribute any of your information to any third party.

Should you wish to withdraw your consent, you may delete your account via the Delete Account link on your Kennel Settings page. Please note that if you add any information (including, but not limited to, updating your kennel description, posting on the forums/chat/guild/cassos, etc) it is your responsibility to edit or delete this information when you delete your account.

#### 3\. Trademarks & Copyright

The images, text, and code of this site belong to FP. You agree not to plagiarize, steal, or otherwise pilfer any of these materials without the sole permission of me, the owner.

#### 4\. Copyright Violations

A user is responsible and accepts complete liability for any content he or she uploads onto Furry Paws and agrees that Furry Paws is not responsible for it. This includes, but is not limited to pictures posted or linked to without the permission from holder of the Copyright, and programming code that is copyrighted by another party.

Art Theft, including but not limited to selling, displaying, giving away or submitting to the Image Bank artwork which is not your own without the original artist's permission; using photographs which are subject to copyright; creating derivative works based on photographs or artwork that is not your own without permission is not allowed. Artwork you have made yourself depicting copyrighted materials may be sold for FP currency (FPD/FPP) only.

Any use found to be in direct connection with uploading, selling, or tracing copyrighted material will result in serious consequences and may result in a banned ("frozen") account. The level of punishment is solely up to Myself and the procedures I have set for the Moderating ("Mod") team.

If you, as a player of FP, find a player in violation of copyrights, the following information is requested to be submitted along with your [ModBox Report](https://www.furry-paws.com/main/%E2%80%9D/modbox%E2%80%9D) to assist the mod team in investigating the claim: (1) link(s) to the art in question, (2) a link to the original if known, (3) proof of ownership if the art is owned by you, and (4) any other information that you believe may aid in investigating the matter. If you are not a Furry Paws member and you believe your art has used without your permission, you may email us at copyright@furry-paws.com and provide as much of the above information as possible along with reason to how or why you believe this is occurring on Furry Paws.

#### 5\. External Links

Furry Paws may provide links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that Furry Paws is not responsible or liable for: the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or the Content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources.

If you continue to play Furry Paws after the effective date of the revised Terms, you will be deemed to have accepted those changes. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, your sole remedy shall be to discontinue use of the Game.

#### 9\. General

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Furry Paws and you with respect to your playing of the Game.

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado. Any disputes arising under or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Colorado.

#### 15\. Advertisement & Soliciting

Advertisement and soliciting activities with respect to in-game goods and Artistic Materials are permitted for in-game currencies for registered members acting as individuals. Users with the Player Recommended Artist status may sell Artistic Materials which they possess Sole Rights to for USD on the USD Art Sale board only. **No other forms of advertisement may be done without the consent of myself.**

_Sole Rights – Can only be held by one individual and gives that individual the ability to sell and modify the Artistic Material. Sole Rights can only be held by the original artist or the commissioner of the Artistic Material who has been granted Sole Rights by the original artist. Upon a player obtaining the art past the aforementioned owners, will not obtain Sole Rights._

#### 16\. Warning, Suspension & Banning of Accounts

You agree that Furry Paws may at any time and without notice warn, suspend, or freeze any or all of your accounts if you fail to comply with the Terms or applicable law. I reserve the right to suspend or ban any account that I feel is not using the Game as I intended. I, as the owner of the site, have selected individual players ("Moderators", "Mods") who are current on the procedures and Terms of Service that I have outlined and have my full support to monitor and enforce those regulations. You agree not to intentionally provide misleading or untruthful information to the Moderators.

#### 17\. Selling & Trading

The sale of Furry Paws Dollars (“FPD”), Furry Paw Points (“FPP”), items, dogs, or accounts for any form of "real life" currency, which includes but is not limited to USD, CD, etc., is strictly prohibited. You agree not to participate in the sale or purchase of such. Players' FPP, FPD, and FP accounts are allowed to be traded/sold for other game currency and accounts (and only if the other game allows the same). Sales of pets or items from any game including FP are not allowed. Selling non-FP products is not permitted. These include but are not limited to code, gaming platforms, art programs, games and live animals.

Buying, Selling and Trading FP accounts is permitted for in-game currencies, however players are reminded that: the history of an account's rule-breaking is permanent, regardless of if accounts are sold, traded or handed on; players are responsible for at no time owning more than 3 accounts, and ownership is defined as but not limited to access to the username and password via email or otherwise for any active, inactive, or frozen account; players are responsible for making sure that the passwords and email address listed to an account is changed upon transfer; any existing PRA, Image Bank Rater, and Newbie Helper status on the account will be revoked.

#### 18\. Selling of Art

_Suitable Evidence – A private message on Furry Paws (including archived messages) with information including, but not limited to: details of the art being sold; sale completion time; restrictions on use, re-sale, breeding, etc._

You agree to only sell art that you are the sole owner of and have full permissions to sell, with the exception of co-owned art explained below. As such, selling art on behalf of another player is not permitted. Should your right to sell a particular piece of be challenged, you must be able to provide Suitable Evidence that you are the sole owner of the art and that you have full permissions to sell the art. If you are unable to do so, you will be unable to sell the art and you may also receive a warning. Artistic Materials generated in whole or in part by Artificial Intelligence ("AI") is considered to have used copyrighted materials from the art used to train the AI and may not be sold on Furry Paws.

Artistic Materials may be co-owned by more than one user. Should the owners wish to sell the art, one owner must take full responsibility for selling the art, including posting the sale, collecting payment, completing the sale, and fulfilling any terms agreed to regarding the sale. Prior to listing the art for sale, all other owners must FP private message the selling owner indicating under what conditions they are giving the selling owner permission to sell the art.

Should you wish to challenge another user's right to sell a piece of art, you must provide Suitable Evidence proving that they either are not the sole owner of the art or that they do not have full permissions to sell the art. Should you wish to challenge another user's right to use a piece of art in a particular way, you must provide Suitable Evidence that the user has violated an art use agreement between you and the user.

When buying Artistic Materials for in-game currencies, players are required send payment as attachments through the private messaging tool. When the recipient of the message collects the attachment, they are bound by the terms detailed in the message. Should the recipient wish to decline for any reason, the recipient should return the attachment to sender. The message the payment is attached to should include the following details at minimum:

a. Copy of the application form found on artist Art Sales Board post. If the artist did not provide a form, include a detailed description of what is being purchased

b. When the commission should be completed (Ex: 2 weeks)

The seller may impose additional restrictions on the art, including but not limited to: restrictions on resale of the art; restrictions on character breeding; restrictions on use. Should the seller wish to impose additional restrictions that are not included in the buyer's original message, the seller must reply to the buyer with all such conditions and wait for the buyer to reply in agreement prior to accepting payment. Failure to do so will render all such conditions unenforceable by the moderator staff. Upon resale of art, it is the seller's responsibility to communicate any and all previously agreed to restrictions to the new buyer. Failure to do so may result in the seller's account being banned should an issue arise.

Players should **not** collect the payment from any message containing terms they are not willing or are unable to fulfill. If a seller collects the payment and is unable to fulfill the request, a prompt refund should be issued. Note that failure to do so could result in the seller's account being banned. Upon completion of the art and/or sale, a link to the art should be sent on the same message where the original payment was made.

Once a transaction is complete, we advise both buyers and sellers to **Archive** the message containing the transaction details. This is to protect all parties involved from scamming claims and/or art theft.

A character is defined as a creature with a particular backstory and a unique design illustrated by a reference image. A unique design is defined as a full-body image of a creature with a particular, complex set of markings not found in nature. Furry Paws will consider a copyright violation of a character to have occurred if:

a. A character is used for a breeding without permission from the character owner

b. A character duplicates the existing unique design of a previously existing character

c. A particular backstory is plagiarized

Artistic Materials may only be sold for real life currencies on the “USD Art Sales Board”. All other Artistic Materials must be sold on the “Art Sales Board” for in-game currencies only. In order to sell on the “USD Art Sales Board”, a player must obtain a “Player Recommended Artist” (PRA) status. This may be obtained by submitting an application through the ModBox. To be eligible for this status a player must be at least level 10, have no previous warnings for art issues, and have a positive player rating in the game. Additionally, activity on the “Art Sales Board”, non-art related player warnings, and contributions to the site Image Bank may also be considered.

The PRA is NOT A SITE RECOMMENDATION as to who you should buy from. The PRA status will be given at the sole discretion of the admin of the site. PRA status is a privilege, not a right, and may be revoked at any time for any reason. If a user's PRA is revoked, they cannot re-apply to obtain a PRA for at least 6 months. If an account with a PRA status is sold to another user, the PRA status and any ratings will be revoked. It is the responsibility of the user who earned the PRA to submit a modbox report regarding the sale of the account prior to completing the sale of the account. Failure to do so may result in a warning.

Any and all sales of Artistic Materials on FP that is done for USD, or any other real life currencies, are not the responsibility of FP. However, FP has a zero tolerance policy for scamming, and should we find what we consider to be conclusive evidence of scamming having occurred, we will IP ban and freeze the offending player(s). Should you decide to purchase art on FP with USD, we recommend that you do the following:

a. Prior to sending payment, message the artist on FP with details of the commission. We strongly advise that you follow the practices outlined in the in-game currency sales section above.

b. Upon sending payment through the payment site, include a copy of the FP message with your payment

c. If work/art piece fails to be completed you must go though the payment site used to get a refund. However if Messages showing that both parties agree the work/art piece would be delivered by a certain date, proof of payment is provided, and the artist cannot show that the art was delivered, repercussions for scamming will be investigated by the Mod team. If no evidence is provided which indicates that a clear timeline was agreed upon, the commissioner must just wait, with a maximum wait time of 30 days from commission date at that time. After that point, if the commissioner can show Suitable Evidence that the agreement between the commissioner and artist was violated, repercussions can be taken but a refund will not be the responsibility of FP.

Any transaction that is not directly covered by the above outline will be at the discretion of the Mod Team to allow and will be at the seller's/buyer's own risk if they proceed.

#### 19\. Donations

FP does not allow for players to ask for donations in the form of “real life” currency which include but are not limited to USD, CD, etc. However the in-game donation of FPP, FPD, or items to another player is allowed. However, players are allowed to provide a link on the “Other Sites Board” to off-site charitable organizations or fundraisers, as long as they are open any individual who wishes to donate.

**ANY ISSUE NOT CLEARLY EXPRESSED BY THE ABOVE TERMS WILL BE HANDLED AT MY DISCRETION AND THE DISCRETION OF MY MODERATORS.**
