GlaxoSmithKline offers products and services to diagnose, prevent and treat disease. Its prescription medicines for use by healthcare professionals are regulated by government agencies in each of the countries in which it does business, such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States (U.S.) or the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom. These regulations often restrict the prescribing information that can be disclosed to the public so that you need to consult with your health care professional. You may also need to visit other healthcare Web sites to find out more about prescription products.
