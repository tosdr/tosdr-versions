Data Processing Agreement Addendum for EEA and EU Residents
===========================================================

Last updated: September 20, 2022

‍

This Data Processing Agreement Addendum (“DPA”) supplements the Backblaze Terms of Service, as updated from time to time between Customer and Backblaze, or other agreement between Customer and Backblaze governing Customer’s use of the Service (the “Agreement”) when GDPR applies to certain customers under Article 26 and Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). In case of a conflict between the terms of this DPA and the Backblaze Terms of Service, this DPA will take precedence.

‍

This DPA is intended to be binding on Backblaze and on each of its customers which provide information protected by GDPR to Backblaze (“Customers”). It governs the processing by Backblaze of personal data, as defined by GDPR, contained in files that Customers store with Backblaze (“Files”).

‍

As GDPR evolves and best practices are refined, Backblaze reserves the right to update this DPA at any time. If there is something we view as a material change, we will provide our Customers reasonable prior notice of the change via email and will offer our Customers the right to terminate the services before the change takes effect.

‍

‍

Consent to processing and transfer of Customer account information:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In conjunction with the provision of Services, the Customer provides information regarding the Customer, which may include information of its employees, to Backblaze in order to receive Services (the “Account Information”). Customer hereby consents to the Account Information being transferred to, shared by and processed by Backblaze, its affiliates and its sub-processors. In the event that the Customer is not the data subject associated with the Account Information, Customer shall obtain express consent from all data subjects to effectuate the consent given herein. Customer acknowledges and accepts the risks associated with sharing and processing of the Account Information as stated herein. Customer understands that the countries or locations where the information will be transferred may not provide an adequate level of data protection based on European Union or other nations’ standards, and the supervisory authority, data processing principles and data subject rights may not be similarly provided in such countries or locations. Customer also consents to Backblaze and its affiliated entities sending it and individuals who are identified in the Account Information marketing communications, understanding that Customer or such individuals can opt out of such communications at any time.

‍

‍

Subject-matter and nature of the processing:
--------------------------------------------

Backblaze offers two services to its Customers: a computer backup service, with which a Customer can backup files to Backblaze servers automatically, and a cloud storage service, with which the customer can upload files to Backblaze servers (together the “Services”). To the extent that these files are uploaded by or on behalf of a Customer who is an organization and they contain personal data as defined in GDPR, Backblaze processes this data as a processor, as defined under GDPR, and Customer is the controller, as defined under GDPR. To the extent that these files are uploaded by or on behalf of a Customer who is an individual in conjunction with Backblaze’s provision of services and they contain personal data as defined in GDPR, Backblaze and Customer act as joint controllers, as defined under GDPR.

‍

‍

Type of personal data and categories of data subjects:
------------------------------------------------------

The types of personal data and categories of data subjects processed in the context of Backblaze’s Services depend on the content of files uploaded to servers by or on behalf of its Customers.

‍

‍

Purpose:
--------

Backblaze will only process the Files to perform the Services for the Customer on the documented instructions from the Customer and to comply with laws to which Backblaze is subject. Where Backblaze processes Files to comply with a legal requirement, it shall inform the Customer which uploaded the data thereof before processing, unless that law prohibits Backblaze from disclosing such information on important grounds of public interest.

‍

‍

Duration:
---------

Backblaze processes Files for the duration it provides the Services to the Customer. When the Customer cancels its Backblaze subscription and deletes its Backblaze account, Backblaze will delete the Files stored in accordance with the Backblaze Terms of Service and will cease to be a processor or joint controller of the Files.

‍

‍

International transfers:
------------------------

The Customer (the “data exporter”) hereby acknowledges that by Backblaze (the “data importer”) providing Services to Customer, personal data provided by Customer to Backblaze in Customer’s Files provided to Backblaze as part of the Services will be transferred outside of the EEA and the Customer agrees to do the following:

1. take all necessary steps to ensure that transfers of personal data outside the EEA are effected by way of valid adequacy mechanisms recognized under European Union law that ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for the personal data, which may include encryption, anonymization, pseudonymization or express data subject consent;
2. maintain accurate and comprehensive records of all transfers of personal data outside of the EEA and document the adequacy mechanism relied upon in each case;
3. take all necessary steps to ensure that the recipient of the personal data can comply with the adequacy mechanism relied upon, including (without limitation) by carrying out and documenting due diligence on all recipients of personal data prior to any transfer occurring;
4. if the adequacy mechanism relied upon becomes invalid or if the recipient of the personal data is not able to comply with the requirements of the adequacy mechanism due to local laws or for any other reason, Customer shall immediately stop all transfers of personal data to Backblaze and shall either put in place an alternative adequacy mechanism or demand immediate return of all personal data from Backblaze; and
5. upon request, the party transferring the Personal Data shall provide evidence of compliance with the obligations set out in this section.

Without limitation of the foregoing provisions, having agreed to the Terms of Service with Backblaze and this DPA, Customer (the data exporter) and Backblaze (the data importer) are deemed to have also agreed to the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto and incorporated herein, including their Annexes, as of the Effective Date of the DPA. Where there is a difference between Module One and Module Two of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Controller-Controller (Module One) Standard Contractual Clauses shall apply to Customers who are individuals and the Controller-Processor (Module Two) Standard Contractual Clauses shall apply to Customers who are organizations.

‍

‍

Confidentiality:
----------------

Backblaze ensures that persons authorized to process the Files have committed themselves to confidentiality.

‍

‍

Security:
---------

Backblaze with regard to Files shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The security measures taken by Backblaze are addressed in more detail on Annex II of the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto as Appendix A.

‍

‍

Subprocessors:
--------------

Backblaze has the Customer’s general authorization for the engagement of sub-processors, and Customer has obtained express consent from the data subject for Backblaze to engage subprocessors. The list of sub-processors the data importer intends to engage can be found [here](https://www.backblaze.com/company/policy/subprocessors). The data importer shall inform the data exporter in writing of any addition or replacement of sub-processors within a reasonable period of time in advance of such addition or replacement, thereby giving the Customer the opportunity to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). Customer and Backblaze shall keep the sub-processor list up to date. When Backblaze engages a processor, it shall impose data protection obligations which are no less onerous than those set out in this DPA on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of GDPR. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, Backblaze remains fully liable to the Customer for the performance of that other processor's obligations, but only to the extent that Backblaze can be held liable under its Terms of Service.

‍

‍

Assistance with exercise of rights:
-----------------------------------

At the request of a Customer, Backblaze shall assist it by appropriate technical and organizational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing and insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the Customer’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of GDPR.

‍

‍

Assistance with security, data breaches and DPA:
------------------------------------------------

Backblaze shall assist the Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to Backblaze. In the unlikely event of a data breach, as defined in GDPR, Backblaze will without undue delay send its affected customers a notification email and provide at its discretion, updates through other communications channels. This notification will describe the nature of the data breach, including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned, the contact point where more information can be obtained, the likely consequences of the personal data breach, and the measures taken or proposed to be taken by Backblaze to address the data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. A “data breach” does not include a Backblaze account being accessed via valid credentials unless those credentials were exposed through some action or fault of Backblaze or one of its sub-processors.

‍

‍

Deletion and return of Files:
-----------------------------

Backblaze shall, at the choice of the Customer, delete or return all the Files to the Customer after the end of the provision of the Services subject to any fee applicable at that time, and delete existing copies within the period set out under “Duration,” unless applicable law requires storage of such data. Subject to any fee applicable at the time, Customers may request copies (i.e., return) of their Files within their Backblaze account prior to cancelling their Services.

‍

‍

Information:
------------

Backblaze shall at the request of a Customer make available to it all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations under this DPA, including a copy of the most recent report on such compliance performed at the request of Backblaze by an external auditor, if available, and only if the Customer agrees to keep such information confidential under a non-disclosure agreement provided by Backblaze. Backblaze shall immediately inform the Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes GDPR data protection provisions applicable to the Customer and/or Backblaze. For further information on our compliance with GDPR, please visit our knowledge base at help.backblaze.com or contact us at [privacy@backblaze.com](mailto:privacy@backblaze.com).

‍

‍

‍

### SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

‍

### _Clause 8: Data protection safeguards_

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.

‍

#### Module One – Controller-Controller

**_8.1_ Purpose limitation**

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose:

* _(i)_ where it has obtained the data subject’s prior consent;
* _(ii)_ where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
* _(iii)_ where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.

**_8.2_ Transparency**

_(a)_ In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:

* _(i)_ of its identity and contact details;
* _(ii)_ of the categories of personal data processed;
* _(iii)_ of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;
* _(iv)_ where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.

_(b)_ Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.

‍

_(c)_ On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.

‍

_(d)_ Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

‍

**_8.3_ Accuracy and data minimisation**

_(a)_ Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.

‍

_(b)_ If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.

‍

_(c)_ The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to

what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.

‍

**_8.4_ Storage limitation**

The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.

‍

**_8.5_ Security of processing**

_(a)_ The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter “personal data breach”). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.

‍

_(b)_ The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

‍

_(c)_ The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

‍

_(d)_ In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

‍

_(e)_ In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.

‍

_(f)_ In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.

‍

_(g)_ The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.

‍

**_8.6_ Sensitive data**

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter “sensitive data”), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.

‍

**_8.7_ Onward transfers**

The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter “onward transfer”) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if:

* _(i)_ it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
* _(ii)_ the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
* _(iii)_ the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter;
* _(iv)_ it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings;
* _(v)_ it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or
* _(vi)_ where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.

Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

‍

**_8.8_ Processing under the authority of the data importer**

The data importer shall ensure that any person acting under its authority, including a processor, processes the data only on its instructions.

‍

**_8.9_ Documentation and compliance**

_(b)_ The data importer shall make such documentation available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

‍

#### Module Two – Controller-Processor

**_8.1_ Instructions**

_(a)_ The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.

‍

_(b)_ The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.

‍

**_8.2_ Purpose limitation**

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.

‍

**_8.3_ Transparency**

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights.

‍

**_8.8_ Onward transfers**

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter “onward transfer”) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:

* _(i)_ the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;

The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least within a reasonable time in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.

‍

_(b)_ Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.

‍

_(c)_ The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter.

_(a)_ The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

_(b)_ The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

* _(i)_ the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
* _(ii)_ the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;
* _(iii)_ any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
