Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your personal information.

Some countries outside of the European Economic Area (the **“EEA”**), the UK and Switzerland are recognized by the European Commission, the UK government or the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner or the Federal Council (as applicable), as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these “specified countries” is available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) (EEA) and [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-transfers-a-guide/#Q1) (UK); for Switzerland the list can be found in Annex 1 of the Ordinance on Data Protection). The UK and Switzerland recognize the EEA and the specified countries as providing an adequate level of data protection according to UK and Swiss standards and vice versa. For transfers from the EEA, the UK or Switzerland to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner or the Federal Council or the UK government (as applicable), we have put in place adequate measures where necessary, such as the standard contractual clauses adopted by the relevant authority to protect your personal information, unless we can rely on a legal derogation. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.

How long do we keep your information?

We retain personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

* The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);
* Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
* Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

Sensitive information

Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us.

Security

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.

We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).

If you would like to update personal information that you have provided to us, you may do so by updating your registered account with us.

Pursuant to California Business & Professions Code section 22581, if you are a resident of California, under 18, and a registered user of the Services, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Services by writing to [privacyrequest@orders.viagogo.com](mailto:privacyrequest@orders.viagogo.com). Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.
