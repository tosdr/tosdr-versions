3 Ticket Marketplace

We are a ticket marketplace that allows registered users to buy (in this capacity, "**Buyer**") and sell (in this capacity, "**Seller**") Tickets. The Seller (and not us) sets the prices for the Tickets. As a marketplace, we do not own the Tickets sold on the Site. Ticket prices may exceed the face value of the Ticket.

While we may provide pricing, shipping, listing and other guidance on the Site, such guidance is solely informational (without any warranty as to accuracy). Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes between Buyer and Seller and provide the Guarantee, we have no control over and do not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of the Tickets; the truth or accuracy of the user’s content or listings; the ability of Sellers to sell tickets or Buyers to pay for them; or that a Buyer or Seller will complete a transaction.

4 Your Account

In order to list, sell or purchase Tickets you must register an account ("**Account**") with us and agree to accept the terms in this User Agreement. You must be at least 18 years old and must be able to enter into legally binding contracts. If you are registering with us for a business entity, you represent that you have the authority to legally bind that entity.

When opening an Account you must provide complete and accurate information including but not limited to your full name, address, phone number, email address and provide us with a valid credit card, debit card or PayPal account ("Payment Method"). If your registration or payment information changes at any time, you must promptly update your details in your Account. You acknowledge that we may charge any one of your payment methods on file for amounts you owe us, costs we incur or other losses arising out of your violation of this Agreement (including the Additional Policies).

We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently suspend Accounts with incomplete or inaccurate information.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information and password. You are solely responsible for any activity relating to your Account. Your Account is not transferable to another party.

5 Privacy and Communications

All communications between you and us (including communications with our service providers, our parent company and/or our affiliates) are subject to our User Privacy Notice.

  

In addition, if you reside in the United States, you understand and agree that we may, without further notice or warning and in our discretion, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with us or our agents for quality control and training purposes or for our own protection. Not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by us so we do not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.

6 Fees and Other Charges

We may charge fees for selling and/or buying Tickets through our Site and/or otherwise using our Services, as well as delivery or fulfillment fees (collectively referred to as "**Service Fees"**). Service Fees may vary depending on event type, Ticket type and location. We may in our sole and absolute discretion change our Service Fees at any time, including after you list your Tickets. Any applicable Service Fees including any taxes if applicable will be disclosed to you prior to listing or buying a Ticket. We may charge and/or retain Service Fees if you do not fulfill your contractual obligations under this User Agreement.

If you as a Seller do not fulfill your contractual obligations under this User Agreement and the Seller Policies, we may charge you certain fees and/or costs in accordance with the Seller Policies.

If you as a Buyer change your postal address after you have purchased your Ticket(s) and require us to deliver your Ticket(s) to this new postal address, or if you have specified an incorrect postal address, we may charge you for any **additional delivery costs** which arise out of re-arranging the delivery of your Ticket(s) to the new or correct postal address. Such additional delivery costs may be charged to your Payment Method.

We may collect amounts owed using a collection agency or other collection mechanism and you may be charged fees associated with collecting the delinquent payments. We, or the collection agency we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, defaults in your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information we reported to a credit bureau, please contact us. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported, contact the collection agency directly.

7 Season Cards

If tickets or seats are sold that are linked to a season ticket which must be made available to the Buyer during the event, the Buyer shall be obligated to return the season ticket to Us immediately after the event, either by dropping the season ticket at a dedicated pick-up and delivery station at the event (if available) or by sending the season ticket to Us by registered mail no later than 48 hours after the event concluding. The Buyer agrees to two charges to the credit card, or payment method, used to purchase the ticket(s) or seat(s) should a season card not be returned to Us within the time period mentioned above: (i) the sale price of the ticket(s) or seat(s), (ii) a “failure to return fee” of $5000 per season card.

8 Selling Tickets

You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the terms of this User Agreement and the [Seller Policies](https://www.stubhub.com/legal?section=sp) when listing, selling and delivering your Tickets.

When listing a Ticket you must set a price for which you are willing to sell your Ticket ("**Sales Price**"). You may modify (e.g. raise or lower the Sales Price) or delete your listing at any time until the Tickets have sold.

By listing a Ticket for sale, you are making a binding offer to sell that Ticket to a Buyer who purchases the Ticket at the Sales Price. When a Buyer accepts your offer by purchasing your Ticket through our Site, you are contractually bound to deliver that exact Ticket for Sales Price and within the required delivery timeframe. You are obligated to monitor your inventory and ensure all listings are accurate. Under no circumstances may Sellers cancel orders at one price and repost the same tickets for a higher price. Failure to fulfill your orders will lead to charges as stated in this User Agreement and [Seller Policies](https://www.stubhub.com/legal?section=sp).

We do not guarantee that your tickets or related passes will sell or that your listing will appear on the Site within a certain time after it is posted or in a particular order on the event page or through search results. We will not, for any reason, provide compensation for tickets that do not sell, even if it is due to Site unavailability from an outage or maintenance or listing delays.

  

Please refer to the [Seller Policies](https://www.stubhub.com/legal?section=sp) for additional terms which apply to you as a Seller.

9 Taxes

You as a Seller are responsible for determining whether any taxes are due on your sale of a Ticket, and for collecting and remitting such taxes, except where we are required by law to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on those sales. Any applicable taxes must be included in the Sales Price of your Ticket. You agree to provide us with your Social Security Number or other tax identification number if necessary for us to provide (without notice to You) information to the relevant tax authorities related to payments you receive from us and further authorize us to release that information to the relevant tax authorities. The Service Fees include any applicable sales, use, excise, value added, service and other indirect taxes.

You agree that we are not responsible in any way for the accuracy or suitability of any payment of taxes to any entity on your behalf, except where we are required by law to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on your sales. You shall indemnify and hold us and (if applicable) any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless against all liabilities, costs, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by us that arise out of any third party or governmental claim that involves, relates to or concerns (i) any local, regional, country, or international tax obligation or amounts due or owing under any tax regulation, law, order or decree or (ii) any dispute concerning our tax status.

10 Buying Tickets

You are responsible for reading the complete listing before making a commitment to buy Tickets. When placing an order, you are entering into a **binding contract** with the Seller to purchase those Tickets. Additional terms communicated to you by the Seller may apply. Payment is remitted to StubHub and disbursed to the seller according to our User Agreement. **All Sales are final**. You cannot change or cancel any orders after the sale is complete.

11 Payments

Payments received from Buyers for Tickets purchased via the Site are processed by us on behalf of the Seller and credited to the Seller in accordance with the [Seller Policies](https://www.stubhub.com/legal?section=sp). Seller appoints us as its limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting funds from Buyers on behalf of Seller. Seller agrees that any payment made by Buyer to us shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to Seller, and Seller will make the Tickets available to Buyer in the agreed-upon manner as if Seller had received the payment directly from Buyer. Except as otherwise specified in the Guarantee, Seller understands that our obligation to pay Seller is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Buyer. Except as otherwise specified in the Guarantee, we guarantee payments to Seller only for such amounts that have been successfully received by us from Buyer. In accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent of seller, we assume no liability for any acts or omissions of the Seller.

Payments from Buyers are due and payable immediately. A Buyer can pay the full order amount which includes any applicable Service Fees and taxes using one of the accepted payment methods.

A Buyer’s obligation to pay for a Ticket is satisfied when we has received the Payment in full.

12 Event Cancellations, Postponement and Other Event Changes

**Cancellation:** If an event is canceled and not rescheduled, we will remove the event and any listings related to the event from our Site and inform both Buyer and Seller about the cancelation with further instructions. If the Seller requires the Seller’s Ticket(s) back to obtain a refund of the original purchase price from the promoter or organizer, the Seller must contact [Customer Service](https://www.viagogo.com/contactus) immediately after the cancelation. The Buyer is required to retain the Ticket(s) and upon our request to send them back to either the Seller or to us (as instructed by us). The Buyer will receive a full refund or credit for use on a future purchase, as determined in our sole discretion (unless a refund is required by law) once the Seller has sent back the Ticket(s) (if applicable) and the Seller will not be paid. If the Seller has already been paid, the payment for the sale may be recovered by charging the Seller's Payment Method or by setting off this amount against pending payments for other Tickets the Seller has sold or will sell in the future.

**Postponement:** If an event is postponed, we will work with Buyers and Sellers on a case-by-case basis attempting to resolve any Ticket issues. Sellers are prohibited from reselling, invalidating or changing Tickets for postponed events. Refunds will not be issued for postponed events, unless they are ultimately canceled as stated above.

**Other event changes:** We are not responsible for partial performances, venue, line-up or time changes. No refunds will be issued in these instances.

**For Quebec residents only:** If an event is postponed or rescheduled, the Buyer will receive a full refund upon a request being made and once the Buyer has sent back the Ticket (s).

13 International Transactions

Many of our Services are accessible to international Sellers and Buyers. We may offer certain programs, tools, and site experiences of particular interest to international Sellers and Buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion.

Your Ticket listing may appear on one or more of our international Sites (including the original Site in which you listed your ticket). Sellers and Buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of Tickets. If you are a consumer seller and do not wish your Ticket listing to be visible internationally, you will need to remove your listing from our Site.

A Ticket to an event taking place in another location from the location of the Site that you listed or bought your Ticket on, or Site that you registered or accessed to sell or purchase your Ticket on (together **“Local Site”** ) is defined as an **“International Event”** . You may be subject with respect to that particular sale or purchase to certain Additional Policies of the Site that relate to the location of the International Event.

As a Buyer, if you are purchasing a Ticket from your Local Site to an International Event, information relating to the Ticket and/or the event may differ to the information that you may receive on your Local Site, as information requirements may vary according to local laws.

As a Seller, if you are selling a Ticket from your Local Site to an International Event, (i) information required by us relating to the Ticket and/or the International Event may differ from the information that you may provide on your Local Site, as information requirements may vary according to local laws, and (ii) you may be required to list the Ticket in the currency of the location of the International Event and your payment service provider may convert the Ticket price and apply additional charges.

To assist users who speak different languages, you authorize us to translate (or use tools to translate) your content related to your Ticket listing, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.

Where as a Seller your Ticket listing appears on one or more of our international Sites, we may as part of our Services display the price of your Ticket in one or more currencies (we reserve the right not to display your Ticket Sales Price in the currency related to the Local Site in which you listed Your Ticket), such information will be provided for informational purposes only (without any warranty as to accuracy) and the Buyer will be required to pay for any such Ticket in the currency applicable to the event.

In order to promote Ticket listings and increase their exposure to potential Buyers, listings may also be displayed on our other Sites or third-party websites and mobile application and within emails and onsite advertisements.

14 Term and Termination

**2\. Non-Individualized Relief**

YOU AND US AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular request for relief within a claim, or if not separable the claim itself, then subject to your and our right to appeal the court’s decision, that request for relief within that claim, or if not separable the claim itself, (and only that request for relief within that claim or, if inseparable, that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. All other claims will be arbitrated.

  

B. Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual; and an arbitrator must also follow the terms of the User Agreement, as a court would.

All issues, including arbitrability, are for the arbitrator to decide, except the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate or the User Agreement is void or voidable.

The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under the Rules, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The Rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (“[**Notice**](https://img.vggcdn.net/webresources/PDF/SH_Notice_of_Dispute.pdf)”). You may download a form Notice. A Notice to us should be sent to StubHub Inc., Attn: Customer Experience Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, PO Box 448, 12180 S 300 E, Draper, UT 84020 United States. We will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.

If you and us are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or us may initiate arbitration proceedings pursuant to the Rules. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to us at the following address: StubHub, Inc. c/o CT Corp. 1209 Orange Street, Corporation Trust Center, Wilmington, DE 19801. In the event we initiate arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your account. Any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator. The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or us may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or us may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users of ours, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

  

C. Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. If (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed in subsection 22(B) above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the Rules.

  

D. Severability

With the exception of any of the provisions in subsection A.1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions”), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an arbitrator or court decides that subsection A.1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then if we so elect, the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the provisions in subsection A.2 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Non-Individualized Relief”) as to a particular request for relief within a claim, or if not separable the claim itself, then subject to your and our right to appeal the court’s decision, that request for relief within that claim, or if not separable the claim itself, (and only that request for relief within that claim or, if inseparable, that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and litigated in in court. All other claims and disputes subject to arbitration under this Agreement to Arbitrate, including any and all claims for monetary damages of any kind, shall be arbitrated.

  

E. Opt-Out Procedure

**You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate (‘opt out’) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (‘Opt-Out Notice’). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept the User Agreement for the first time. You may also opt out no later than 30 days upon receipt of notice that the arbitration provision is being updated or changed. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to StubHub, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Opt-Out Notice, 1209 Orange Street, Corporation Trust Center, Wilmington, DE 19801.**

For your convenience, we are providing an [Opt-Out Notice](https://img.vggcdn.net/webresources/PDF/SH_Opt-Out_Notice_Form_C_06-18.pdf) form you must complete and mail to opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number and the email address(es) used to log in to the account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the User Agreement will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

  

F. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and us agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding between you and us prior to the effective date of the change. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and us . We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on [https://www.stubhub.com](https://www.viagogo.com/) at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the amendments and by sending notice via email to your email address on file with us. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you may close your account within the thirty (30) day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.

**If you reside outside of the United States or Canada** and a dispute arises between you and us, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by contacting [Customer Service](https://www.viagogo.com/contactus). For the avoidance of doubt, if you are a consumer residing in the European Union, please note that we do not (and are not legally obliged to) participate in any ADR procedures or services, unless otherwise provided by law.

24 Release and Indemnification
