Cookie Notice
-------------

This Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy (**“Cookie Policy”**) describes the different types of cookies and similar technologies that are used on the website from which you are accessing this Cookie Policy (the **“Website”**). We may change this Cookies Policy at any time. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through this Website.

What are cookies and similar technologies?

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device and to remember your actions and preferences (such as login details, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time.  
  
Cookies store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our Website.  
  
Web beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) are a similar technology which typically uses transparent graphic images placed on a site to gather information about a user. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to measure the actions of visitors on websites. We make use of cookies and similar technologies when you visit our Website, and refer to the technologies together as “cookies” throughout this policy.

First and Third Party Cookies

Cookies can be ‘first party’ or ‘third party’, depending on the website or domain placing the cookie. On our Website, first party cookies are cookies set by us and information is collected and used by us. Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a company other than ourselves, and the information collected is controlled by that other company. For more information on third party cookies used on the Website, see the _“Types of cookies used on our Website”_ section below.

Session and Persistent Cookies

We use cookies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session cookies) and cookies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent cookies).  
  
You are free to block, delete, or disable these cookies in general by changing the settings on your browser or device, or by changing specific settings for our Website, although please be aware that if you do, some of the functionality of our Website will be lost.

How we use cookies

We rely on your consent to use first and third party cookies (except “strictly necessary cookies”, as described below).

Some of the third party providers mentioned below may be located outside Switzerland and the European Eco-nomic Area (EEA) or may process your personal data outside this area, in principle in any country in the world. These countries may not have laws that protect your personal data to the same extent as in Switzerland or the EEA. If we transfer your personal data to such a country, we will ensure the protection of your personal data in an appropriate manner. For more information on safeguards we implement in this regard, please see our Privacy Policy. You accept that your data may be transferred to a country that does not have adequate level of data protection and accept the risks that your data may potentially be subject to government lawful access in the recipient's country, despite the safeguards we put in place. You can withdraw your consent to cookies at any time, as ex-plained below.

You can find more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, at www.aboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu

Please visit [here](https://www.viagogo.com/help/cookies-list) for more information about the individual cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and the duration of the cookies.  
  
**Strictly necessary cookies.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Website, add items to your basket or to make payments via our Website. We do not require your consent in order to place these cookies since they provide essential Website functionality and without them, you would be unable to use our Website and services.  
  
**Preference cookies.** These are used to collect information about you and your choices to allow us to recognize you when you return to our Website. This enables us to enhance and personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region and your log-in information).  
  
**Analytical/performance cookies.** These cookies collect information about your use of our Website. For example, analytical/performance cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and show us how visitors use and interact with our Website, the items that have been clicked on and the individual pages that have been viewed. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. Any information collected is only used by us for purposes related to improving our Website. When you first access our Website, we ask for your consent to place analytical/performance cookies on your device.  
  

**Google Analytics.** We use Google Analytics service (as provided by Google, Inc. (**"Google"**), which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Website and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.

**Advertising cookies.** These cookies are set to display targeted promotions or advertisements based upon your interest on our Website or to manage our advertising. These cookies collect information about your activities on our Website and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising.  
  
You may encounter cookies from our third-party service providers, including but not limited to (1) Facebook to provide advertising services through Facebook’s advertising and marketing platforms (e.g., Audience Network, Website Custom Audiences) and other social networking plug-ins or marketing tools, and (2) Google to provide advertising services through Google’s advertising and marketing platforms (e.g., DoubleClick for Publishers, Google DoubleClick AdX Service, Adwords). Facebook and Google may use the personal information that they have collected about you on our Website pursuant to their own privacy policies (Facebook Data Policy: [https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation) and Google Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)).

If you are using the Japanese language version of our Website, additional cookies will be placed by [A8.net](https://www.a8.net/).  
  
**Pixel tags.** Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) are used to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Website, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the Website and response rates.  
  
**LSOs.** We use Local Shared Objects (**“LSOs”**) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Website. If you do not want LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust your settings to block LSO storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html).

Please note that setting the LSOs player to restrict or limit acceptance of LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some LSOs applications.

We also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you can allow or deny such uses and sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
