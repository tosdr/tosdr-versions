**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Panda Security takes reasonable precautions, including organizational, technical, and physical measures, to help safeguard your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites after your sessions. If you have any questions about the security of our websites, contact us (see "[How to Contact Us](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-trust-center/privacy-policy#contact)" below).

**TRANSFERS OF YOUR INFORMATION**

Personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in Spain, in the United States or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We maintain primary data centers in the United States, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and Japan. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Policy is processed as described in this Policy and according to applicable law wherever the data is located.

We may transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland (collectively "Europe") to other countries that may not have the same level of data protection that applies in your jurisdiction. In these cases, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, including entering into the standard contractual clauses for the transfer of European data approved by the European Commission, or where required, we will ask you for your prior consent.

**STORAGE AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly. We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information based on the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).

After expiry of the applicable retention periods, your personal information will be deleted. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of that data.

For further information on applicable data retention periods, please contact us (see "[How to Contact Us](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-trust-center/privacy-policy#contact)" below).

**YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS**

We will review and process your request in accordance with our obligations under applicable law.

**Opt-Out Preference Signals**

Our website recognizes the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal. If you are using a browser setting or plug-in that sends an opt-out preference signal to each website you visit, we will treat that as a valid request to opt out. You can download a browser supporting the GPC browser signal at [https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs). If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.

Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, our website does not currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it receives “Do Not Track” signals.

**Your preferences for email marketing**

You can opt out of receiving promotional emails from Panda Security by following the instructions in those emails. If you would like to manage your contact preferences, you can do so [here](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/about/unsubscribe/).

If you wish to make your request to us, please provide the name of the Panda Security business customer who submitted your data to us.
