=============

**Last Updated: 29 January, 2024**

This Cookie Policy (the "**Policy**") explains how Panda Security, S.L.U. ("**Panda Security**," "**our**," "**we**," or "**us**") uses cookies and similar technologies (such as pixel tags or web beacons) when you use and interact with [www.pandasecurity.com](http://www.pandasecurity.com/) and any other Panda Security websites that include a link to this Policy (the "**Website(s)**").

Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website or service tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website or service tied to the web beacon. For example, we or our marketing partners, may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us or our partner when you click on a link in the email that directs you to our Website. We use web beacons to understand usage and marketing campaign effectiveness, and to operate and improve our Website, services, and email communications.
