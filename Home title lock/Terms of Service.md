By accessing or using the Website or ordering, receiving, or using any products or services offered by Home Title Lock through the Website (collectively the “Products and Services”), you agree to follow and to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference, including without limitation our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions, you may not access or use the Website, order, receive, or use the Products and Services.

Home Title Lock reserves the right to change or modify these Terms and Conditions from time to time at its sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms and Conditions, we will provide you with notice of such changes through the Website or by updating the “Last Updated” date at the end of these Terms and Conditions.

By continuing to access or use the Website or order, receive, or use the Products and Services, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and Conditions and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage you to review the Terms and Conditions frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when your access or use of the Website and when you order, receive and/or use the Products and Services. If you do not agree to the revised Terms and Conditions, you may not access or use the Website or order, receive, or use the Products and Services.

All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) are not permitted to use the Website.

II. REGISTRATION, SUBSCRIPTION PLAN, AND COMMUNICATIONS

To access and use the Products and Services, you will need to register for a Home Title Lock account. By creating an account, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete account information, (b) maintain and promptly update, as necessary, your account information, (c) maintain the security of your account credentials, (d) be responsible for the acts or omissions of any third party who has authority to access or use the Website on your behalf, and (e) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Website or your account. You further understand and agree that Home Title Lock may take actions we deem reasonably necessary to prevent, respond to, pursue or remedy suspected or actual fraud and abuse, including without limitation, termination or suspension of your account.

By creating a Home Title Lock account, you also consent to receive electronic communications from Home Title Lock, including through email, text messaging, or by posting notices to the Website. These communications may include notices about your account, such as subscription period lapse, home title alerts and other transactional information. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including, but not limited to, that such communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of all electronic communications you receive from us. We may also send you promotional communications by email or text messaging that we think will be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving these promotional emails at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in such email or text messaging.

It is your responsibility to keep your account information updated.

When you add to your account an address to monitor, you will be asked to select the subscription plan applicable to such property. The subscription plan you select will automatically renew until you cancel the renewal as described below.

III. PAYMENT, REFUNDS AND CANCELLATIONS

Subscriptions to our Products and Services will require you to make payment of the corresponding fees. Payments of subscription fees you make are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise described in the Refund Policy below or otherwise determined by Home Title Lock. You authorize Home Title Lock to submit through its payment processor the charges for the subscription you select using the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. Home Title Lock may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. Your service will automatically be renewed, and your chosen payment method will be charged at the end of each service period, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments for the Products and Services before the end of the then-current subscription. All prices, including recurring subscription fees, are subject to change.

Home Title Lock reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, taxes, and/or surcharges for any or all Products and Services obtained through the use of the Website at any time. Home Title Lock may also, in its sole discretion, make promotional offers with different features and different rates to any or all of our customers. Unless made to you, these promotional offers will have no bearing on your obligation to pay the amounts charged.

If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.

However, by uploading, posting or submitting User Content to the Products and Services or to our pages or feeds on third-party social media platforms (e.g., Home Title Lock’s Facebook page, LinkedIn page or Twitter feed), you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, anonymize, de-identify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and publicly display your User Content, in whole or in part, in any manner or media and for any purpose whatsoever at our sole discretion, including, without limitation, for publicity, promotional, advertising, trade, business, illustration, artistic and other commercial and noncommercial purposes.

You agree that we may disclose or use any User Content for any purposes permitted under applicable law, including, but not limited to: (a) enforcing these Terms; (b) complying with any laws, regulations or rules of any federal, state or local government or agency; (c) responding to claims that any User Content violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protecting the rights or property of Home Title Lock, its customers or the public.

You may access, download or copy content on the Website only for personal, informational and non-commercial purposes; provided, however, that the Home Title Lock trademark and copyright symbol and statement (as set forth on each such page of the Website) appears on each copied or downloaded page and no modifications are made to any content on the Website. The rights expressly granted in the preceding sentence to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title. Home Title Lock reserves the right to revoke your limited license to access, download and print the content available on the Website at any time, and any such use by you shall be discontinued immediately upon written notice from Home Title Lock.

Except as expressly provided herein, you may not use, download, upload, copy, print, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, post, transmit or distribute any content from the Website in whole or in part without the prior written permission of Home Title Lock.
