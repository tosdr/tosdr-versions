If you do not consent and agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you cannot, and we do not authorize you to, access, browse, or use the Home Title Lock Services.

Our processing of personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number, will be undertaken consistent with the requirements of applicable privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2021, the Colorado Privacy Act of 2021, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act of 2022, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”).

2\. Information We Collect

(2) company information (such as your company’s address); and

(3) other identifying information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without limitation unique identifiers such as passwords, and personal information in messages you send to us.

We may also collect additional information, which may be personal information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. 

**2.2 Information We Automatically Collect When You Use Our Site**

In order to access and use certain areas or features of the Home Title Lock Services, you consent to our collection and use of certain information about your use of the Home Title Lock Services through the use of tracking technologies or by other passive means. Your consent to our access and use of this “passively collected” information includes, but is not limited to, the domain name of the website that allowed you to navigate to the Home Title Lock Services, search engines used, the internet protocol (IP) address used, the length of time spent on the Home Title Lock Services, the pages you looked at on the Home Title Lock Services, other webpages you visited before and after visiting the Home Title Lock Services, the type of device and/or internet browser you have, the frequency of your visits to the Home Title Lock Services, and other relevant statistics (collectively “Traffic Data”).

3\. How We Collect Information

We collect information (including personal information and Traffic Data) when you use and interact with the Home Title Lock Services, and in some cases from third party sources. Such means of collection include:

* When you access, use, or contact us through the Home Title Lock Services.
* When you voluntarily provide information through the Home Title Lock Services.
* If you use a location-enabled browser, we may receive information about your location and device.
* Through Cookies, Web Beacons, analytics services, and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Tools**”**).

4\. Tracking Tools, Behavioral Advertising, and Opt Out Options

**4.1. Tracking Tools**

We may use tools outlined below in order to provide the Home Title Lock Services, advertise to, and better understand users.

* **Cookies:** “Cookies” are small computer files transferred to your device that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Home Title Lock Services. We use Cookies to: (i) improve and tailor the Home Title Lock Services, (ii) customize advertisements, (iii) measure performance, (iv) store authentication so re-entering credentials is not required, (v) customize user experiences, and for (vi) analytics and fraud prevention. For more information on Cookies, including how to control your Cookie settings and preferences, visit [http://www.allaboutCookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). You can also manage Cookies in your web browser (for example, Edge, Explorer, Chrome, Safari). If you choose to change your settings, you may find that certain functions or features of the Home Title Lock Services will not work as intended. The follow details the types of Cookies we use and why we use them:
* Absolutely necessary Cookies. These Cookies are essential to enable you to move around a website and use its features. Without these Cookies, services you have asked for, like adding items to an online order, cannot be provided.
* Performance Cookies. These Cookies collect information about how you use the Home Title Lock Services. Information collected includes, the Internet browsers and operating systems used, the domain name of the website previously visited, the number of visits, average duration of visit, and pages viewed. These Cookies do not collect information that personally identifies you and only collect aggregated and anonymous information. Performance Cookies are used to improve the user-friendliness of a website and enhance your experience.
* Functionality Cookies. These Cookies allow the Home Title Lock Services to remember choices you make (such as your username, language preference, or the area or region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These Cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other customizable parts of the Home Title Lock Services. The information these Cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
* **Web Beacons:** “Web Beacons” (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that may be used to collect information about the use of the Home Title Lock Services. The information collected by Web Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Home Title Lock Services, using selected publishers’ websites, or opening emails, and for what purpose.
* **Web Service Analytics:**  We may use third-party analytics services in connection with the Home Title Lock Services, including, for example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text typed into the Home Title Lock Services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the Home Title Lock Services easier to use and as otherwise set forth in Section 5 (How We Use Your Information). These analytics services generally do not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it.
* **Mobile Device Identifiers:**  As with other Tracking Tools, mobile device identifiers help Home Title Lock learn more about our users’ demographics and Internet behaviors in order to personalize and improve the Home Title Lock Services. Mobile device identifiers are data stored on mobile devices that may track activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it.  Mobile device identifiers enable collection of personal information (such as media access control, address, and location) and Traffic Data.

**4.2. Behavioral Advertising**

We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising.  This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools to collect information about a user’s online activities to display Home Title Lock ads to the user based on the user’s interests (“Behavioral Advertising”). Our partners may include third-party advertisers and other third-party service providers, and such partners may collect information when you use the Home Title Lock Services, such as IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, and demographic information. These Tracking Tools help Home Title Lock learn more about our users’ demographics and Internet behaviors.

**4.3. Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers**

If we process Cookies based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any point in time by contacting us at service@hometitlelock.com. Please note, if you exercise this right, you may have to provide your consent on a case-by-case basis to enable you to utilize some or all of the Home Title Lock Services.

You may be able to reject Cookies and/or mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your browser or device. Although you are not required to accept Home Title Lock’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Home Title Lock Services.

* You may opt out of receiving certain Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) opt out page, or by installing the DAA’s AppChoice app (for iOS; for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en)) on your mobile device. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete Cookies on your device, you may need to opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices, please visit [http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device](http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device). You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.
* Even after opting out of Behavioral Advertising, you may still see Home Title Lock advertisements that are not interest-based (i.e., not targeted toward you). Also, opting out does not mean that Home Title Lock is no longer using Tracking Tools. Home Title Lock still may collect information about your use of the Home Title Lock Services even after you have opted out of Behavioral Advertising and may still serve advertisements to you via the Home Title Lock Services based on information it collects through the Home Title Lock Services.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of Cookies and other Tracking Tools by any third parties, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party. Please be aware that some third-party Cookies can continue to track your activities online even after you have left the Home Title Lock Services.

**4.4.  “Do Not Track” (DNT) and Universal Opt-Out Preference Signals**

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have their online activity and behavior tracked. If a web service operator elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the web service operator may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many web service operators, including Home Title Lock, do not proactively respond to DNT signals.  For more information about DNT signals, visit [http://allaboutdnt.com](http://allaboutdnt.com/).

New standards are being developed for a Universal Opt-Out Mechanism, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), which allow users with GPC-enabled browsers and devices to send a signal that will communicate the user’s request to opt-out of sales of their personal information and to opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information. The CPRA and other laws allow for the acceptance of Opt-Out Preference Signals such as the GPC, as an option for users to transmit an Opt-Out of selling/sharing personal information. If we detect and recognize such a signal from your device or browser, we will honor it.

5\. How We Use Your Information

We do not engage in automated decision making. We may use information (including information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) to better understand who uses the Home Title Lock Services, how we can deliver a better user experience, and for any other purpose permitted by applicable law. We use information, including personal information, to provide the Home Title Lock Services and to help improve the Home Title Lock Services, to develop new services, and to advertise our services. Specifically, such use may include:

* Enforcing our Privacy Policy and other agreements.

By providing your e-mail and/or phone number and checking a box, clicking the “complete” button, or some other affirmative act, you are consenting to receive e-mails and/or calls and text messages, including live, prerecorded, and/or automated calls and messages, to that email or phone number. After signing up, you will receive a confirmation e-mail or text message from Home Title Lock on your mobile number. This agreement is not entered into as a term or requirement of any purchase or promotion. Normal message and data rates may apply. Message frequency may vary. Neither we nor the participating carriers guarantee that messages will be delivered.  We may discontinue these programs at any time without notice.

We will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy practices.
* We also may need to disclose your personal information or any other information we collect about you if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with or fulfill our obligations under applicable law; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of you, Home Title Lock or another party; (3) enforce this Privacy Policy or other agreements with you; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights.

We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us.
