Please read these Terms of Service (these “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy ([https://Poplin.co/privacy-policy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://poplin.co/privacy-policy&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1711424103485614&usg=AOvVaw2H6fdH7o-eNFpf3t5g-7NT)) (“Privacy Policy”) carefully because they govern your use of the Poplin website located at [https://Poplin.co/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://poplin.co/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1711424103485978&usg=AOvVaw3zew64XeF1f5z2_Csl34e7) (the “Site”) and our associated Poplin marketplace which connects laundry service providers and individuals seeking laundry services (the “Marketplace”), along with any other services accessible via the Site and corresponding mobile application (“App”) offered by Poplin Technologies, Inc.\[1\] (“Poplin”).  

To make these Terms easier to read, (a) the Site, the App and the above-described services and features available through the Site and App, including the Marketplace, are collectively called the “Platform” and (b) “you” means: (i) you, the individual using the Platform; and (i) any other person or entity on behalf of which you use the Platform, including as indicated in any account created by you for use of the Platform (“Account”).

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. USERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND Poplin THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 22 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. 

1. Agreement to Terms. By accepting these Terms or using the Platform, you (a) agree to be bound by these Terms and (b) represent and warrant that you have been duly authorized to bind any person or entity on behalf of which you use the Platform, including as indicated in your Account. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Platform.

It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Platform. If you continue to use the Platform after we have posted updated Terms, it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Platform anymore. Because the Platform is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Platform, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.  The provisions of Section 22 may only be updated by Agreement of Poplin and the User.

However, should you need to cancel an approved or accepted Order, you must cancel your Order through the Platforms. Failure to notify a Customer that you intend to cancel an accepted Order within 4-hours before the Pick-Up Deadline, the Order will be recorded as Unauthorized Cancellation (“UC”). If you have UC rates in excess of 10% of your confirmed Orders, you will be in breach of the Terms and Poplin may terminate, deactivate, or otherwise restrict you from accessing or using the Platforms. Failure to meet the pick-up and delivery deadlines for a confirmed Order will be a breach of contract.

You will be solely responsible for any damage or loss that occurs with respect to any laundry you collect, receive or otherwise provide any Laundry Services.  Poplin may charge you for the costs of repairing or replacing any such laundry or garments and set off the costs of such repair or replacement against any Partner Fees that would otherwise have been payable to you, or deduct such amounts for repair or replacement from your bank account directly in accordance with the Poplin Protection Plan.  You authorize Poplin and its payment processor to access and debit your bank account for this purpose.
6. In exchange for permitting the Platform to transact your services through the Marketplace, you agree that Poplin will retain a fee of twenty-five percent (25%) of the Net Laundry Services Fees collected by the Platform (“Marketplace Fee”). The Net Laundry Services Fees equal the total amounts of Laundry Services Fees received from the Customer, less any applicable processing fees and costs.  The Marketplace Fee is subject to change and will be communicated to you in the online orientation and/or on the Platform.  In the event of cancellation of Laundry Services by a Customer when you are in transit to pick-up the laundry, you are required to return all such laundry, and you acknowledge that the applicable Laundry Services Fees for such transaction will be limited to the cancellation fee paid by the Customer.
7. As a Laundry Pro, upon a satisfactory completion of the Laundry Services, and upon Customer's payment for such Laundry Services, your Account will be credited with payment of the Net Laundry Services Fees, less the Marketplace Fee retained by Poplin. In addition to the foregoing, you will be entitled to the entirety of any tip, bonus, or gratuity provided to you by the Customer via the Platform, less any processing fees from our selected third party payment processor (collectively, the “Laundry Pro Fees”). Poplin will process all payments due to you through its payment processor. You acknowledge and consent that these amounts will not include interest and will be the net of any amounts that we are required by law to withhold.
8. Poplin reserves the right to hold back any funds from you temporarily or permanently, for any reason, including without limitation, if Poplin believes that you have attempted to defraud or exploit Poplin or Poplin’s payment systems, or if a Customer makes a claim against Poplin or you that Poplin believes is your liability or responsibility.
9. As a Laundry Pro, you are an independent contractor.  You hereby agree to provide Poplin with a W-9 and consent to Poplin providing you with your 1099 and any other tax documents (“Tax Information”) via email and waive your right to receive such Tax Information via mail or in hard copy.
10. Poplin reserves the right to change the Marketplace Fee at any time. If a change is made, Poplin will provide you with notice. Continued use of the Platform after any such change in the fee calculation shall establish your consent to such change.
11. We reserve the right to approve or reject any Laundry Pro's application registration and to remove any Laundry Pro from the Marketplace for any reason, including, but not limited to, poor customer reviews, performance of Laundry Service, damage to any laundry or garments, any inaccuracy in the applicable Laundry Pro Information, engaging in, promoting, and/or facilitating the removal of customers from the Poplin app, or any breach by you of these Terms.
12. We (or our designated third-party payment processor) will pay you each installment of the Laundry Pro Fees to your account designated within the Platform within the period of time you select via the Platform.  Depending on your experience, performance, and in Poplin’s sole discretion, such time periods available for your selection may be different. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we will not be liable to you for any Laundry Pro Fees that we are unable to collect from any Customer.
13. Order Dispute Resolution: Poplin tries to make sure that Customers are happy with the Laundry Services provided by Laundry Pros, but we understand that this is not always going to be the case. When a Customer is not satisfied with Laundry Services that are provided, and such dissatisfaction is reported to Poplin (e.g., damages or lost garments, weight of laundry) we may, at our discretion, issue a refund or adjust the Order Fee, and any components thereof, for such Order. As a result, this may affect the amount paid to Laundry Pro. We call these instances “Order Disputes.” A Order Dispute includes, but is not limited to, the following: (a) when a Laundry Pro is incapable of or unwilling to adequately perform the Laundry Services agreed to for the Order; (b) when a Laundry Pro inaccurately verifies the weight of the Laundry into the Platforms, and, as a result, was or may be overpaid for the Order; (c) if during the Order, a Laundry Pro damages or loses garment(s) or did not comply with safety or health standards or customer requests that were required given the nature of the particular Order. If a Customer submits an Order Dispute, Poplin will investigate the matter. Investigation may require the Laundry Pro to return to the Customer’s residence to reweigh the laundry. After Poplin receives an Order Dispute, we will contact Laundry Pros and Customers to provide any information regarding the matter. Based on the Investigation and in the sole discretion of Poplin, it may withhold payment from the Laundry Pro – in whole or in part, provide an extra payment to the Laundry Pro, and require the Customer to pay a full or partial amount for completion of the Order.

20. Limitation of Liability.

1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER Poplin NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE PLATFORM WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT Poplin OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL Poplin’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM EXCEED THE GREATER OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500) AND THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US HEREUNDER IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS.

2. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Poplin AND YOU.

21. Governing Law and Forum Choice. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, with the exception of Section 22, “Dispute Resolution,” which is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. In the event the Federal Arbitration Act is found not to apply, then the law of the state in which arbitration is conducted will apply to Section 22, “Dispute Resolution.”  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 22, “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Poplin are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the New York City, New York and you and Poplin each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
22. Dispute Resolution.

1. Limitation on Time to File Claims

1. ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE PLATFORM MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, UNLESS SUCH BAR IS NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

2. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

1. How This Agreement Applies. You and Poplin mutually agree to resolve any and all covered justiciable disputes between the Parties exclusively through final and binding individual arbitration instead of a court or jury trial. Laundry Pro also understands and agrees that this Arbitration Provision and Class Action Waiver applies to any disputes that Laundry Pro may have with Poplin, including Poplin’s licensors, clients, customers, dental offices, and agents all of which are deemed third party beneficiaries of this provision.  This Arbitration Agreement and included Class Action Waiver is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) and evidences a transaction involving commerce. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver applies to any and all claims arising out of or relating to the Terms, the Laundry Pro's classification as an independent contractor, Laundry Pro's provision of services, Laundry Pro's use of the Platform, any payments made or received by Laundry Pro through the Platform or arising out of or relating to the acceptance or performance of services arranged through the Platform, the termination of these Terms, and all other aspects of the Laundry Pro's relationship (or the termination of its relationship) with Poplin, past, present or future, whether arising under federal, state or local statutory and/or common law, which Poplin may have against Laundry Pro or which Laundry Pro may have against Poplin and its owners, officers, employees or agents, including but not limited to Poplin. You and Poplin agree that the mutual obligations to arbitrate disputes provide adequate consideration for this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.
2. As limited exceptions to Section 22 (b)(i) above: (1) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (2) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
3. Additionally, except as these Terms otherwise provide, the Arbitrator, and not any court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the validity, applicability, enforceability, unconscionability, or waiver of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. However, as stated in the “Class and Collective Action Waivers” section below, the preceding sentence does not apply to the Class Action Waiver. Additionally, the first sentence of this paragraph does not apply to any claims under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.
4. If any claim(s) not covered under this Agreement above are combined with claims that are covered under this Agreement, to the maximum extent allowed under applicable law, the covered claims will be arbitrated and continue to be covered under this Agreement.
5. Limitations on How This Agreement Applies. The following claims are not covered under these Terms: (1) Laundry Pros’ compensation benefits, state disability insurance benefits or unemployment insurance benefits; however, these Terms apply to discrimination or retaliation claims based upon seeking such benefits; and (2) disputes that an applicable federal statute expressly states cannot be arbitrated or subject to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, including disputes that may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreement under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.
6. Nothing in these Terms prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with a government agency, including without limitation the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, National Labor Relations Board, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or law enforcement authorities. Nothing in these Terms prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by these Terms. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by these Terms. Nothing in these Terms prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration. The Poplin will not retaliate against you for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
7. A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy in accordance with applicable law, and any such application shall not be deemed incompatible with or waiver of this agreement to arbitrate. The court to which the application is made is authorized to consider the merits of the arbitrable controversy to the extent it deems necessary in making its ruling, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law. All determinations of final relief, however, will be decided in arbitration.
8. Starting the Arbitration. If either party initiates arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via U.S. Mail, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include: (1) the name and address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim; and (3) a description of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration by Laundry Pro must be delivered to Poplin at tech@Poplin.co. The arbitrator will resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
9. Class, Collective, and Other Representative Action Waivers (“Class Action Waiver”). Poplin and Laundry Pro mutually agree that by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, both waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, and/or other representative action to the maximum extent permitted by law, and an arbitrator will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any such class, collective, or other representative action. Laundry Pro also waives Laundry Pro's right to receive notice of any class, collective, or other representative action that may be filed. This Class Action Waiver does not apply to non-individual representative actions for civil penalties filed under the California Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) (but to the extent permitted by applicable law, a Laundry Pro’s individual claim under PAGA must be arbitrated and is covered by this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver). Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below and incorporated herein by reference, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or other representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective, or other representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
10. Laundry Pro agrees and acknowledges that entering into this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver does not change Laundry Pro's status as an independent contractor in fact and in law, that Laundry Pro is not an employee of Poplin and that any disputes in this regard shall be subject to arbitration as provided in this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.
11. Except as otherwise stated in this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver, any arbitration shall be governed by the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), subject to the following:
12. The arbitration shall be heard by one arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney experienced in the law in the underlying dispute and licensed to practice law in the state in which the arbitration is convened, or a former judge from any jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have authority to decide gateway issues, including arbitrability.
13. The location of the arbitration proceeding will be in the county and state where Laundry Pro last performed services for Poplin, unless Laundry Pro and Poplin agree in writing otherwise.
14. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, as determined by the Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Company and Laundry Pro will share all fees and costs associated with arbitration equally, including but not limited to filing fees, room fees, and Arbitrator compensation.
15. The Arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties in accordance with any applicable federal or state law) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party’s claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.
16. Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver, the Arbitrator may award all remedies to which a party in his or her individual capacity is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration. The Arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable.
17. Either party may file motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment and the Arbitrator will apply the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions.
