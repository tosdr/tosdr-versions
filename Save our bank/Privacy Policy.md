Who are we?
-----------

The Customer Union for Ethical Banking (CUEB) is an independent, not-for profit cooperative. Its members are Co-op Bank customers who support the aims of the cooperative. CUEB is keeping a constant eye on the Co-op Bank, ensuring that it sticks to its ethical principles and aiming eventually to help it return to cooperative ownership. CUEB was set up by the founders of the Save Our Bank campaign.

We keep our members and supporters informed with an email newsletter and our website. We meet with the bank and other organisations to help us achieve our aims. CUEB members pay a small subscription to help us continue this work.

How do we collect information from you?
---------------------------------------

* We collect browsing information on your IP address, what pages are accessed and when. This is done via cookies.
* We collect personal information such as your name and email address when you sign up as a supporter of the campaign.
* We collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number when you become a member of CUEB.
* We do **not** store payment information. If you pay your membership subscription using Direct Debit, credit or debit card details or Paypal, the details of your card or account are not stored on our systems but are transmitted directly to our third party payment processors: GoCardless, Stripe or PayPal, each of whom specialise in the secure online capture and processing of payment transactions.

How is your information used?
-----------------------------

We use your information to:

Third Party Service Providers working on our behalf
---------------------------------------------------

We may pass your information to our third party service providers, agents subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing services to you on our behalf (for example to process subscriptions and send you mailings). However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own direct marketing purposes.

CUEB uses the following Third Party Service Providers:

**Mailchimp**

We use Mailchimp to send email newsletters to our supporters and members. This means that personal details of supporters and members including name, email address and membership status are stored on Mailchimp’s servers in the USA.
