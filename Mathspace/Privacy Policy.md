Privacy Policy
==============

Effective date: Oct 16, 2023

Protecting the privacy of all individuals, and particularly students, using Mathspace is a priority for us. Details of how we do this are provided below.

Our Privacy Principles
----------------------

* We abide by all FERPA and GDPR requirements.
* We are committed to creating a safe and secure online environment for our users.
* We strive to be as open and transparent as possible. We have endeavored to write this policy in a way that is clear and easy to navigate. It is important to us that our users can easily understand the personal information we collect about them and how we protect their privacy.
* We will never sell your personal information to third parties.
* We take the protection of your personal information very seriously, using the best of modern technology feasible for us to protect data and restrict unauthorized access to that information.

Introduction
------------

This Privacy Policy provides important information about the privacy practices of Mathspace Inc. ("Mathspace", "us", or "we") for our website (www.mathspace.co), our associated learning tools and mobile applications.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store and disclose the personal information you provide to us as part of your use of our services. With respect to personal information, Mathspace is referring to information which can be used to personally identify a user, such as full name, email address, school name or a photograph.

Collection of Personal Information
----------------------------------

We take the information you provide to us very seriously, and we strive to put you in control of decisions around that information. Mathspace collects the following information about you and your use of our services:

### Personal information.

When you register for, browse and/or use our services, you may provide Mathspace with "personal information" (such as your full name, email address or a photograph) that can be used to identify you. For School Users, your personal information is also presented to educators in your school or district.

### Information about your use of our services and other user-provided information.

We may collect usage information about your use of certain features of our services, such as the number of problems you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed and the amount of time spent to complete a problem. This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you.

### Location information.

We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country) to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region, but we do not collect the precise geolocation of you or your device.

Mathspace uses personal information in the following ways:
----------------------------------------------------------

### To enhance our services and the services we provide.

Mathspace uses the personal information you provide or that we collect to enhance our relationship with you and to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all of the features and services that we provide. Mathspace, for instance, remembers your recent activity so we can recommend the most appropriate content for you on your next visit.

### To understand how you and other users use our services.

Mathspace uses any non-personally identifiable information that you provide or that we collect from users in an aggregated format to understand and analyze the usage trends, learning behaviors and preferences of our users, to improve the way our services work and look, and to create new features and functionality.

### Ownership of Data for School Users

In addition to presenting student data within our service we provide Schools the ability to download data of student activity on our Services to a CSV file. This data is owned by the School and continues to be the property of and under the control of the School.

### Data Retention and Backup

Any user may request a deletion of account details at any time. School administrators may also request a deletion of account details at any time on behalf of their School users. In such cases we will first allow the school to download any data to a CSV file for their ownership. We will then proceed to delete any personal data including names, emails and School name from our database. We will maintain deidentified transactional data for the purposes of improving our adaptive recommendations to all users which is a core part of our service.

For all account deletion requests we may continue to store data on our backup databases for a period of up to 90 days as part of our regular backup processes for restoring user data in case of emergency.

### Backup Measures

* Database backups are produced daily by an automated system.
* Database backups are stored encrypted with AES-256.
* Database backups are kept up to 90 days.
* Any data requested to be deleted will be retained for the 90 days of backups only.
* Our Recovery Time Objective is 8 hours and Recovery Point Objective is 24 hours.
* Audit logs for site users are kept only for admin user transactions, and are stored permanently. The elements stored are timestamp, description of changes, and user ID, and kept as a history against each admin user and affected record.
* Audit logs are visible only to admin users. Only engineers are able to access the log storage to delete audit logs.

Our Approach to Data Security
-----------------------------

### Data security is important to you, and to us.

Mathspace uses a combination of physical, managerial and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and other information we store in connection with our services. For example, when you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, no data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We take every precaution available to protect all data provided to us in the educational pursuit of digital content.

Mathspace uses Amazon Web Services to host our website, with personal information stored in an encrypted database. Our website is hosted in the United States.

Data Breaches
-------------

If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your personal information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on our website if a data security incident occurs.

* Data breaches should be reported immediately to the Mathspace support team with full and accurate details of the incident, including who is reporting the incident, what type of incident it is, if the data relates to people, and how many people are involved. Contact details are [\[email protected\]](https://mathspace.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and [\[email protected\]](https://mathspace.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).
* Our Data Breach Policy describes a response plan with the following stages:
    1. Contain the breach and make a preliminary assessment
    2. Evaluate risks associated with the breach
    3. Notification of the breach
    4. Review and respond to prevent future breaches
* Mathspace will immediately notify affected users and conduct an internal investigation of the breach, and remedy as appropriate. We attempt to respond quickly to any data breach through the following measures:
    * Automated vulnerability scanning will immediately detect changes to files that match malware signatures.
    * Daily code deployment process raises warnings for other unexpected changes to files.

### Transmission of Data

All website data is transmitted over HTTPS, with preference for TLS 1.2. Please see our A+ rating with Qualys SSL Server Test: [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=mathspace.co](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=mathspace.co).

#### Secure Data Exchange

Districts integrate with Clever to sync their data. Districts send a request through Clever to add the Mathspace application, and enable Data Sharing with Mathspace. The district is able to select how much data to share. Mathspace needs teachers, students, sections and schools data, with names. Emails are recommended. Mathspace will then be able to sync the data shared through Clever Secure Sync. Data accessed from Clever is only transmitted through HTTPS/TLS 1.2 encrypted protocols. Mathspace runs a daily automated sync task, as well as can sync on demand.

Alternatively, districts may upload CSV files onto our SFTP server, which can be processed on an automated daily schedule. Districts must provide Mathspace with a public key to initiate an account. Districts must then upload complete CSV files of teachers, students, enrolments, sections and schools with ID, name and email records.

Data accessed from Clever is only transmitted through HTTPS/TLS 1.2 encrypted protocols. Data accessed from our SFTP server is only transmitted through SSL 2/3 encrypted protocols. All access to and from Mathspace servers is through encrypted protocols such as HTTPS or SSL.
