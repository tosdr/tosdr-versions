    1. All intellectual property rights to the Services, the Website, the Customers System, the data stored in the Customers System, names, logos, Service names, descriptions, trademarks, software, designs, as well as all of their updates, modifications, improvements, supplementations, corrections and new versions and other property attributes, including all and any intellectual property rights attributed to them, shall be owned by Interneto Vizija, and these rights shall not be transferred or assigned to the Customer.

10. **PERSONAL DATA**
    1. Interneto Vizija shall process personal data relating to provision of the Services as indicated in the Privacy Policy, with which the Customer must familiarise himself.

A separate personal data processing agreement shall not be concluded between the Parties.
11. **LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES**
    1. Where a Party sustains any damages by reason of any unlawful actions of the other Party, the guilty Party must compensate for the direct damages sustained by the aggrieved Party, except in cases where legal acts obligate the guilty Party to compensate for all the damages sustained by the aggrieved Party.

    4. The Services shall be provided in accordance with the principles “as is” and “as available.” Interneto Vizija shall not guarantee that access to the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.

    5. Interneto Vizija shall not guarantee that the Customer will be always able to avail of the Services at the desired place and time because provision of the Services also depends on other factors that are beyond the control of Interneto Vizija, e.g. unstable or unavailable internet connection, a faulty device of the Customer or the Customer’s service user, failure to provide data required for provision of the Services, etc.
    6. The Customer shall be liable in full for the following: (i) the content of any information that he sends, receives and stores using the Services (including any violations of legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania that regulate intellectual property, protection of personal data, provision of advertising services, etc.); (ii) any damage and inconvenience that arises to the Customer’s end users as well as any damage caused by the end users to Interneto Vizija and/or third parties (including any violations of legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania that regulate intellectual property, protection of personal data, provision of advertising services, etc.); and (iii) in case of failure of the Services, the Customer shall be liable for prompt provision of information to Interneto Vizija. The Customer must also take all steps to prevent any damage relating to Service failures or minimise the consequences of any damage that occurs.
    7. The Parties shall not be liable for failure to fulfil their obligations, if the failure results from any circumstances that the Parties could not have controlled or reasonably foreseen at the time of conclusion of the Agreement and where the Parties could not have prevented the appearance of these circumstances or consequences thereof (_force majeure_ circumstances, e.g. fire, actions of state authorities, announcement of an emergency situation and/or lockdown, military actions or civil unrest, attack against electronic systems used by Interneto Vizija, including any systems managed by Interneto Vizija’s service providers, etc.). Where the said circumstances last for more than 1 (one) month, the Parties may terminate the Agreement.
