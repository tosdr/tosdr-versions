Refund policy
=============

Returns Process

To make a return, please email **support@vidglo.com** to request a Return & Exchanges form.   
  
You will be responsible for paying your own shipping costs for returning your item(s). 

Refunds on returned items  
  
Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment.   
  
Please note that refunds on returned items may not extend to shipping fee costs. If we shipped an item you purchased, but the parcel was sent back due to customer error, the shipping fees are non-refundable. 

Exchanges Process

We only replace items if they are defective or damaged upon arrival. 

We can accommodate garment size change requests, but please note that the shipping cost of the item return is the responsibility of the customer. We will bear the shipping cost of the replacement.  
  
If you wish to purchase an item of clothing, we highly recommend checking the item sizing guide first. We display both EU and US sizes, so please make sure you have the correct size garment in your basket before proceeding with your order. 

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary. 

If you are shipping an item with a value over $75 USD, we recommend that you consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item. 

Sale items

Only regular priced items may be refunded. Unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded. 

Gifts (if applicable)  
  
If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you. 

If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and they will find out about your return. 

Return / Refund Exemptions 

Our policy lasts 45 days. If 45 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. 

Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases. Additional non-returnable items include gift cards, downloadable software products, and some health and personal care items. 

There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted (if applicable), e.g. books with obvious signs of use, CD, DVD, VHS tape, software, video game, cassette tape, or a vinyl record that has been opened. Any item not in its original condition, is damaged, or missing parts for reasons not due to our error are not eligible for a return.  
  
Any item that is requested for a return, or returned, more than 30 days after delivery may also not be eligible for a refund, unless stated otherwise.   
  
To complete your return, we may require a receipt or proof of purchase.
