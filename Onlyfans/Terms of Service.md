    2. You are legally responsible for all Content you Upload. If you are a Creator and someone else assists you with the operation of your Creator account, this does not affect your legal responsibility.

            1. of satisfactory quality, taking account of any description of the Content, the price, and all other relevant circumstances including any statement or representation which you make about the nature of the Content on your account or in any advertising;
            2. reasonably suitable for any purpose which the Fan has made known to you; and
            3. as described by you.
    4. You are liable to and will indemnify us if any warranty in this section of these Terms of Use is untrue. This means you will be responsible for any resulting loss or damage we suffer.

We reserve the right to remove Content that violates our Terms of Service.
    6. You agree to act as custodian of records for all Content you Upload to OnlyFans.
9. **Fan subscriptions and purchases:** This section applies to Creator Interactions including Subscription billing and renewals:
    
    1. Creator Interactions are governed by the [Contract between Fan and Creator](https://onlyfans.com/contract). We may moderate Content and we facilitate Creator Interactions by providing the OnlyFans platform, but we are not a party to the [Contract between Fan and Creator](https://onlyfans.com/contract) or any other contract between a User and a Creator, and we are not responsible for Creator Interactions.
    2. Creators are solely responsible for determining any pricing applicable to Creator Interactions.
    3. All prices appear, and are charged, in USD. Payment providers may charge currency conversion fees.
    4. Fan Payments are exclusive of Indirect Sales Tax, which shall be added at the current rate as applicable to Fan Payments.
    5. When a Creator receives Notice that the Creator Interaction has been confirmed, that Creator must perform their part of the Creator Interaction. Creators agree to indemnify us for any breach of this obligation and are responsible for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of such failure.
    6. Before entering into a Creator Interaction with a particular Creator, Users must add payment information to their account and then click 'Subscribe' on the relevant Creator's account.
    7. Users authorise us and each Subsidiary to supply payment information details to a third-party payment provider for the purpose of processing Fan Payments.
    8. The payment provider will take: (i) periodic payments for Fan Payments which are Subscriptions; and (ii) immediate payments for Fan Payments other than Subscriptions. You authorise and consent to each of these payments being debited using your supplied payment information.
    9. If you provide details of more than one payment method and a Fan Payment from the first method fails, we will use the other payment method for the Fan Payment.
    10. **When you select "Subscribe," you agree to start a Subscription. A Subscription will automatically renew at the current rate (plus Indirect Sales Tax). You authorise us to charge you again after each Subscription**, unless: (i) your payment is declined and you have not provided another payment; (ii) the Subscription price has increased; (iii) you switched off the "Auto-Renew" feature on the Creator's account; or (iv) you close your OnlyFans account before the new subscription period begins. **By selecting "Subscribe," you agree to these provisions, and acknowledge that you will not receive further Notice regarding the renewal of that Subscription.**
    11. If you cancel a Subscription, you can view the relevant Creator's Content until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will be taken from you in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile (unless you begin a new Subscription to that Creator's profile), and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Creator's Content.
    12. You agree not to make: (i) unjustified requests for a refund; or (ii) unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider in relation to any Creator Interaction or tip to a Creator. If we determine that any refund or chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we may suspend or delete your User account.
    13. You can prepay an amount on OnlyFans ("**Wallet Credits**") which you can later use for Fan Payments. Purchases on OnlyFans cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount for that purchase. Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as indicated. Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits. Wallet Credits are non-refundable, which means that you are not entitled to a refund of any unused Wallet Credits.
10. **Creator payouts:**
    
    1. All Fan Payments will be received and processed by a third-party payment provider we approve.
    2. Our Fee is calculated as 20% of the total Fan Payment and will be deducted from each Fan Payment.

    4. To withdraw Creator Earnings from your OnlyFans account, your account balance must meet the minimum payout amount requirement.
    5. All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted in USD. Your bank or e-wallet company may charge currency conversion or other fees. We do not control currency exchange rates, banking charges, or e-wallet provider charges. We and any Subsidiary are not responsible for paying such charges.
    6. If a Fan successfully seeks a refund or chargeback from their credit card provider of a Fan Payment, we may deduct an amount equal to the Creator Earnings portion of the refunded or chargedback amount.
    7. Except for Payout Options by direct bank transfer, we do not store the data you disclose when you register your Payout Options with a payment provider.
11. **Tax compliance:**
    
    1. **General:**
        
        1. Creators are responsible for their own Tax affairs and neither we nor any Subsidiary: (i) are responsible for advising you on your Tax affairs or liable for any general Tax information provided on OnlyFans or by [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com); or (ii) liable for any Creator's non-payment of Tax.

If, while you have an OnlyFans account, you become Tax non-compliant in relation to your use of OnlyFans or if you are named in any litigation, inquiry, or investigation in connection with, or which may lead to, any Tax non- compliance in connection with your use of OnlyFans, we reserve the right to close, restrict payouts from, or restrict earnings from your account.

    1. Whether you are a Consumer or Business User we do not limit our liability where it would be unlawful to do so. Consumers may rely on mandatory provisions of law that apply to them and nothing in our Terms of Service affect a Consumer's rights to rely on mandatory provisions of local law.
    2. If you are a Consumer, you agree that:
        
        * We, each Subsidiary, and our employees, owners, representatives, and agents are not liable to you for any loss of profit, loss of business or revenue, business interruption, loss of business opportunity, or loss of anticipated savings arising from or in connection with your use of OnlyFans.
        * If you are a Consumer User and reside in the United States of America, our total liability to you for claims arising out of or related to your agreement with us shall be limited to USD $250 per claim.
    3. If you are a Business User, you agree that:
        
        * We, each Subsidiary, and our employees, owners, representatives, and agents:
            
            * exclude (to the extent permitted by law) all implied conditions, warranties, representations, or other terms that may apply to OnlyFans or any Content. This means that if the Terms of Service do not expressly include a promise or commitment by us, then one cannot be implied by law;
            * are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not a foreseeable result of our breaching the Terms of Service or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you agreed to the Terms of Service, both we and you knew it might happen;
            * are not liable to you for any loss or damage, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, even if foreseeable, arising out of or in connection with:
                
                * your inability to use OnlyFans or any of its services, features or programs; or
                * your use of or reliance on any data or information (including Content) stored on OnlyFans;
            * are not liable to you for any loss of profits; loss of sales, business, or revenue; business interruption; loss of anticipated savings; loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; loss of data or information (including Content); or indirect or consequential loss or damage;
            * are not liable to you if your Content is copied, distributed, reposted elsewhere or its copyright is infringed;
            * are not liable to you for any disclosure of your identity, or any disclosure or publication of your personal information by other Users or third parties without your consent (also known as "doxing");
            * are not liable to you for any failure or delay by us in complying with any part of the Terms of Service arising from events outside our reasonable control.
        * Our total liability to you for any and all claims arising out of or related to your agreement with us, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise shall be limited to the greater of:
            
            * 100% of the total fees paid by you to us in connection with your use of OnlyFans; or
            * USD $5,000.
22. **General:** You agree that:
    
    1. If any aspect of your agreement with us is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
    2. If we fail to enforce any aspect of your agreement with us, it will not be a waiver.
    3. We, each Subsidiary, and our employees, owners, representatives, and agents reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
    4. No implied licenses or other rights are granted to you in relation to any part of OnlyFans, save as expressly set out in the Terms of Service.
    5. Agreeing to our Terms of Service and using OnlyFans does not create an agency, partnership, joint venture, franchisor-franchisee, representative, fiduciary, or employee–employer relationship. You do not have authority to bind us or any Subsidiary in any manner.
    6. Your agreement with us does not give rights to any third parties, except that each Subsidiary and our employees, owners, representatives and agents may enforce the exclusions and limitations of liability and the terms relating to disputes in our Terms of Service.
    7. You cannot transfer, assign, or subcontract your rights or obligations under any agreement with us.
    8. Our rights and obligations under your agreement with us can be assigned or transferred by us to others. We may delegate the performance of any of our obligations under your agreement with us to any third-party.
    9. The Terms of Service form the entire agreement between us and you regarding your access to and use of OnlyFans, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between us and you.
    10. If you have a complaint about OnlyFans, refer to our [Complaints Policy](https://onlyfans.com/transparency-center/complaints) and our [Appeals Policy](https://onlyfans.com/transparency-center/appeals). If you wish to communicate with us about OnlyFans or our Terms of Service, please email [support@onlyfans.com](mailto:support@onlyfans.com).
23. **Choice of law and forum for disputes:**
    
    1. For Consumers:
        
        * Choice of law: To the greatest extent permitted by the laws of the place where you live, your agreement with us is governed by the laws of England, which will apply to any claim arising out of or in connection with your agreements with us or your use of OnlyFans including non-contractual disputes or claims. You may also rely on mandatory rules of the law of the country where you live.
        * Forum selection: For United Kingdom and European Union residents, the courts of England and Wales or the courts of the country where you live will have jurisdiction over a claim which arises out of or in connection with your agreement with us or your use of OnlyFans (including non-contractual disputes or claims). For all others, the courts of England and Wales will have jurisdiction over any claim which arises out of or in connection with your agreement with us or your use of OnlyFans (including non-contractual disputes or claims).
        * For United States residents, a court in Wilmington, Delaware will have jurisdiction over any claim that is exclusively against Fenix Internet LLC, located at 1000 N. West Street, Suite 1200, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fenix International Limited.
    2. For Business Users:
        
        * Choice of law: If you are a Business User, your agreement with us is governed by the laws of England and Wales, which will apply to any dispute arising out of or in connection with your agreement with us or your use of OnlyFans including non- contractual disputes or claims without regard to conflict of law provisions.
        * Forum selection: If you are a Business User, you and we agree that the courts of England and Wales will have jurisdiction over any claim which arises out of or in connection with your agreement with us or your use of OnlyFans (including non- contractual disputes or claims).
    3. Limitation period for bringing claims: Except where prohibited by applicable law, any claim or cause of action against us or any Subsidiary must be filed within the earlier of one year after the date on which such claim or cause of action arose or the date on which you learned or should have learned of the facts giving rise to the cause of action, or that claim is expressly waived and cannot be brought.
    4. You agree to notify us prior to bringing any cause of action and, if we request it, to submit any dispute to pre-suit mediation. This provision is a material inducement to allow you to use OnlyFans.
    5. If you are a User and commence proceedings against us or any Subsidiary, we reserve the right to terminate your account to minimise the risk of potential harm to OnlyFans, to us, and to our community.
    6. Documents which initiate Consumer disputes exclusively against Fenix Internet LLC must be served in accordance with US law. Fenix Internet LLC does not accept service in any other manner. All other documents initiating proceedings must be served in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. We do not accept service in any other manner.
    7. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section is a material breach of the Terms of Service.
