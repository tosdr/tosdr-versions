1. Who we are
    ==========
    
    Fenix International Limited and its subsidiaries ("**OnlyFans**", "**we**", "**us**", "**our**") respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting the personal data we process about you. OnlyFans is a social network which enables: (i) "**Creators**" to share and monetise their own content (as well as subscribe to, and view, the content of other Creators); and (ii) "**Fans**" to subscribe to, and view, the content of Creators.
    
2. About this Policy
    =================
    
    This privacy policy ("**Policy**") explains our practices with respect to the personal data we process about our Creators and Fans. Some parts of the Policy are specifically aimed at Creators, and some parts are specifically aimed at Fans. It also applies to how we process the personal data of individuals that feature in content uploaded by a Creator ("**Content Collaborators**"), and where we process personal data about you in the context of our business relationships.
    
    We process your personal data when you use our website located at [www.onlyfans.com](https://onlyfans.com/) ("**Website**") and for the provision of the services that we offer from time to time via our Website.

We refer to these activities collectively as the "**Services**" in this Policy.

10. Our onboarding processes
    ========================
    
    **CREATORS**
    
    We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that all Creators on the Website: (i) are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) verify their identity. Before you can start a Creator account, we will:
    
    * Ask you to provide Creator User Data, as set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**.
    * Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to the Website and the Services.
    * Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**. This is necessary so that payments can be made to Creators for content, and so that Creators can access their earnings via the Website. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
    * Ask you to go through a third-party age and identity verification process:
        
        * This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
        * As described at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**, we **do not** collect, receive, possess, or have access to any Face Recognition Data collected or processed by our third-party providers through this process.
        * Where permitted by applicable law, we receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, and certain Technical Data, as set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**, to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
    * Check that you have not previously been banned from using the Website and our Services (e.g. as a result of violating our [Terms of Service](https://onlyfans.com/terms) ).
    
    **FANS**
    
    We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that: (i) all Fans on the Website are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) Fans in certain locations verify their identity. Before you can start a Fan account, we will:
    
    * Ask you to provide Fan User Data, as set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**.
    * Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to the Website and the Services.
    * Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**. This is necessary so that Fans can make payments to Creators. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
    * Ask you to go through a third-party process to gain assurances of your age. The specific process will depend upon your location and the third-party provider. This may include:
        
        * **Third-party age and identity verification**
            
            * For certain locations, we are required to verify the age and identity of our Fans, so we need to take additional steps. This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
            * As set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**, we **do not** ourselves collect, receive, possess, or have access to this data.
            * Where permitted by applicable law, we may receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, and certain Technical Data, as set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**, to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
        * **Third-party age estimation**
            
            * For certain locations, we use third-party providers to conduct age estimation. This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif "selfie" (that you provide to the third-party provider) and using digital technology to estimate your age, which may involve the use of Face Recognition Data.
            * If you go through the third-party age estimation process, we will only receive the results of the process (pass / fail and reason for failing), to maintain a record of the age estimation process.
            * If you fail the third-party age estimation process (e.g. if you are over 18 years of age, but their technology has predicted that you look under 18 years of age), you may have the option to go through the third-party age and identity verification process set out above.
    
    **MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ONBOARDING PROCESSES**
    
    * **Why does OnlyFans use third-party face recognition technology?**
        
        * The use of face recognition technology by our third-party providers is an important technological measure used in our wider onboarding processes for Creators and Fans. It is intended to ensure safety on the Website and our compliance with applicable laws.
        * We use third-party service providers to carry out age and identity verification, who carry out these services on our behalf, as data processors.
    * **How does Face Recognition Data help to prevent fraud?**
        
        * Face recognition technology reduces the possibility of fraudulent face image spoofing and the uploading of fraudulent government identity documents when individuals go through the onboarding process.
        * Where our third-party providers have identified possible fraud attempts (such as the use of fake or otherwise manipulated documents) our third-party providers may maintain a record of such attempts, including Face Recognition Data, for the purposes of detecting unlawful activity and preventing access to the Website.
    * **Periodic authentication of your identity**
        
        * During the time that you hold an account with us, we may require you to periodically authenticate your identity. If you have gone through the third-party age identity verification process, where permitted by applicable law our third-party providers may retain Face Recognition Data to enable you to authenticate your identity. Where this is retained, you do not need to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again when authenticating your identity.
        * **Withdrawing your consent:** You may withdraw your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data for the purposes of subsequent authentication (and delete this) by contacting [\[email protected\]](https://onlyfans.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). While withdrawing your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data will not affect your ability to complete a subsequent authentication process, it may require you to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again during the authentication process.
    
11. How / why your personal data is used and lawful bases for processing
    ====================================================================
    
    We process personal data for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:
    
    * **Consent:** Your consent is requested only in specific circumstances which includes, for example, the processing of: (i) Face Recognition Data by our third-party providers as part of the age and identity verification process for all Creators (and for Fans in certain locations); and (ii) age estimation captures (which may involve the use of Face Recognition Data) by our third-party providers for Fans in certain locations. Please see **Section 10 (_our onboarding processes_)**, above, for further information.
    * **Performance of a contract:** By using the Services, you have contracted with us through our [Terms of Service](https://onlyfans.com/terms), and we will process personal data to perform that contract (e.g. to fulfil transactions between Fans and Creators and process Creator earnings) and to enforce the terms of that contract.
    * **Legitimate interests:** We may process personal data if it is in our, or a third-party's, legitimate interests (as detailed in the table below). This includes, for example, investigating and responding to a report made through our [DMCA takedown procedure](https://onlyfans.com/dmca) to protect a Creator's intellectual property rights.
    * **Compliance with legal obligations:** As a global business, we may process personal data to comply with applicable law, rules and regulations in the locations where we operate.
    * **Task carried out in the public interest:** We may process personal data as necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. This may include, for example, reporting illegal activity to relevant law enforcement authorities, other governmental agencies and non- governmental organisations.
    
    We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

12. Obtaining your personal data
    ============================
    
    We collect your personal data from the following categories of sources:
    
    * **Directly from you:** When you provide it to us directly to open an account and use the Services, when you update your personal data in your account, or by corresponding with us (e.g. User Data, Account Data).
    * **Automatically or indirectly from you:** For example, through and as a result of your use of the Services (e.g. Transaction Data, Technical Data, Usage Data).
    * **From our service providers:** For example, where permitted by applicable law, we receive Third-Party Onboarding Data and certain Technical Data from our third-party age and identity verification providers.
    
13. Sharing your personal data
    ==========================
    
    We share personal data with the following categories of third parties:
    
    * **Our third-party service providers:** Such as our IT, payment processing, customer support, content and text moderation, and age and identity verification / age estimation service providers. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests (namely the receipt of services to support business functionality).
    * **Our professional advisers:** Such as our legal advisors, bankers, auditors, accountants, consultants, and insurers. Our professional advisors will process personal data as necessary to provide their services to us. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests (namely the receipt of professional services).
    * **Corporate:** Relevant third parties in the event of a possible sale, merger, acquisition, business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our and the relevant third parties' legitimate interests (namely assessing and putting into effect potential transactions).
    * **Our group companies:** For the centralised coordination and management of our business, in accordance with the purposes set out at **Section 9 (_categories of personal data_)**. These recipients will process personal data in the same way as set out in this Policy.

    * **Relevant authorities, regulators and organisations:** In response to requests from governmental authorities (including law enforcement and tax authorities), regulators, and certain non-governmental organisations (such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)). These recipients will use your personal data in the performance of their regulatory, law enforcement or otherwise charitable or not-for-profit role. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing personal data with these recipients is that the processing is either necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or necessary for our, or a third-party's, legitimate interests, or where it is in the interests of the wider public to do so (namely reporting illegal content to, and assisting with requests from, such authorities, regulators and organisations, to protect the safety of our users and third parties).
    
14. International data transfers
    ============================
    
    We share your personal data within our group companies and to our third parties, as set out at **Section 13 (_sharing your personal data_)**.
    
    In some circumstances, this will involve transferring your data outside the UK, the EEA and Switzerland. We make those transfers: (i) to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data; (ii) using appropriate safeguards; or (iii) where otherwise authorised by applicable law.
    
    Please contact us using the contact details set out at **Section 19 (_assistance and contact information_)** if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the UK, the EEA and Switzerland.

    ===================================
    
    You have certain rights regarding the collection and processing of personal data. You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details set out at **Section 19 (_assistance and contact information_)**.
    
    Under certain circumstances and subject to certain exemptions, you have the right to:
    
    * **Withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data:** Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
    * **Request to know or access to your personal data:** You may receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    * **Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you:** You may correct any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you.
    * **Request deletion / erasure of your personal data:** You may ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no legitimate reason for us continuing to process it. You also may ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below). Please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request of deletion / erasure for specific legal reasons.
    * **Request the restriction of processing of your personal data:** You may ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
    * **Request the transfer** of some sections of your personal data to another party.
    
    **You also have the right to object to processing of your personal data** where we are relying on a legitimate interest for the processing and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
    
    We do not process personal data that is subject to **solely automated decision-making**, where that decision-making is likely to have a legal or similarly significant effect on you.
    
    You also have the right:
    
    * **To lodge a complaint** with a data protection regulator. For example, in the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and in Switzerland, this is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).
