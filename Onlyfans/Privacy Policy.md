1. Introduction
    ============
    
    Fenix International Limited ("**we**", "**us**", "**our**") respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting the Personal Data we process about you. Fenix International Limited is the owner and operator of [www.onlyfans.com](https://onlyfans.com/) ("**OnlyFans**"), a social network and content sharing platform which enables: (i) "**Creators**" to share and monetise their own content (as well as subscribe to, and view, the content of other Creators); and (ii) "**Fans**" to subscribe to, and view, the content of Creators.
    
    This privacy policy ("**Policy**") explains our practices with respect to the Personal Data processed about our Creators and Fans. It also explains our practices with respect to the Personal Data processed about individuals that feature in content uploaded by a Creator ("**Content Collaborators**"), and where we process Personal Data in the context of our business relationships.
    
    We process your Personal Data when you use OnlyFans and for the provision of the services that we offer from time to time via OnlyFans (the "**Services**"). We are a "data controller" of the Personal Data that we process in connection with the Services. This means that we decide the reasons why we process Personal Data about you and how we do so.
    
    If you have any questions about this Policy or our processing of your Personal Data, please see **Section 19 (_assistance and contact information_)** for information about how to contact us.
    
2. What is Personal Data?

    In addition, we may collect data that is not capable of identifying you or is otherwise not associated or linked with you, such as deidentified, aggregated or anonymised information. This type of data is not Personal Data and our use of such data is not subject to this Policy.

9. Our onboarding processes
    ========================
    
    **CREATORS**
    
    We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that Creators on OnlyFans: (i) are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) verify their identity. Before you can start a Creator account, we will:
    
    * Ask you to provide Creator User Data, as set out at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**.
    * Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to OnlyFans and the Services.
    * Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**. This is necessary so that payments can be made to Creators for content, and so that Creators can access their earnings via OnlyFans. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
    * Ask you to go through a third-party age and identity verification process, as described below.
    * Check that you have not previously been banned from using OnlyFans and our Services (e.g. for violating our [Terms of Service](https://onlyfans.com/terms)).
    
    **CONTENT COLLABORATORS**
    
    We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that Content Collaborators on OnlyFans: (i) are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) verify their identity. Before you can feature in content uploaded by a Creator we will ask you to go through a third-party age and identity verification process, as described below. You may also be required to provide a release form.
    
    **FANS**
    
    We have processes in place that are intended to ensure that: (i) all Fans on OnlyFans are at least 18 years of age; and (ii) Fans in certain circumstances or locations verify their identity. Before you can start a Fan account, we will:
    
    * Ask you to provide Fan User Data, as set out at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**.
    * Check your country of residence. This check is intended to ensure lawful access to OnlyFans and the Services.
    * Ask you to provide Financial Data, as set out at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**. This is necessary so that Fans can make payments to Creators. Financial Data is also collected as a verification and anti-fraud measure.
    * Ask you to go through a third-party process to gain further assurances of your age. This may include a third-party age and identity verification process, or third-party age estimation process, as described below. The specific process will depend upon your location, or other circumstances (e.g. if we detect suspicious activity on your account).
    
    **THIRD-PARTY AGE AND IDENTITY VERIFICATION**
    
    * We use third-party providers to conduct age and identity verification.
    * This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif, taken from a "selfie" and photo from a government identity document (in both cases, that you provide to the third-party provider). The third-party provider then uses Face Recognition Data to match the two images so they can digitally verify your age and identity.
    * As described at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**, we do not collect, receive, possess, or have access to any Face Recognition Data collected or processed by our third-party providers through this process.
    * Where permitted by applicable law, we receive from our third-party providers Third-Party Onboarding Data, as set out at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**, to maintain a record of the age and identity verification process.
    
    **THIRD-PARTY AGE ESTIMATION**
    
    * For certain locations, we use third-party providers to conduct age estimation.
    * This process involves our third-party provider collecting a short .gif "selfie" (that you provide to the third-party provider) and using digital technology to estimate your age, which may involve the use of Face Recognition Data.
    * As described at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**, we do not collect, receive, possess, or have access to any Face Recognition Data collected or processed by our third-party providers through this process.
    * If you go through the third-party age estimation process, we will only receive the results of the process (pass / fail and reason for failing), to maintain a record of the age estimation process.
    * If you fail the third-party age estimation process (e.g. if you are over 18 years of age, but the technology has predicted that you look under a set threshold), you may have the option to go through the third-party age and identity verification process set out above.
    
    **MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ONBOARDING PROCESSES**
    
    * **Why does OnlyFans use third-party face recognition technology?**
        
        * The use of face recognition technology by our third-party providers is an important technological measure used in our wider onboarding processes for Creators and Fans. It is intended to ensure safety and security on OnlyFans and our compliance with applicable laws.
        * We use third-party service providers to carry out age and identity verification, who carry out these services on our behalf, as data processors.
    * **How does Face Recognition Data help to prevent fraud?**
        
        * Face recognition technology reduces the possibility of fraudulent face image spoofing and the uploading of fraudulent government identity documents when individuals go through the onboarding process.
        * Where our third-party providers have identified possible fraud attempts (such as the use of fake or otherwise manipulated documents) our third-party providers may maintain a record of such attempts, including Face Recognition Data, for the purposes of detecting and preventing unlawful activity, and preventing fraudulent access to OnlyFans.
    * **Periodic authentication of your age and identity**
        
        * During the time that you hold an account with us, we may require you to periodically authenticate your identity. If you have gone through the third-party age identity verification process, where permitted by applicable law our third-party providers may retain Face Recognition Data to enable you to authenticate your identity. Where this is retained, you do not need to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again when authenticating your identity.
        * **Withdrawing your consent:** You may request the withdrawal of your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data for the purposes of subsequent authentication (and delete this) by contacting [\[email protected\]](https://onlyfans.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). While withdrawing your consent to the retention of your Face Recognition Data will not affect your ability to complete a subsequent authentication process, it may require you to provide the third-party provider with your government identity document again during the authentication process.
    
10. How / why your Personal Data is used and lawful bases for processing
    ====================================================================
    
    We process Personal Data for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:
    
    * **Consent:** Your consent is requested only in specific circumstances which includes, for example, the processing of: (i) Face Recognition Data by our third-party providers as part of the age and identity verification process for all Creators (and for Fans in certain circumstances or locations); and (ii) age estimation captures (which may involve the use of Face Recognition Data) by our third-party providers for Fans in certain locations. Please see **Section 9 (_our onboarding processes_)** for further information.
    * **Performance of a contract:** By using the Services, you have contracted with us through our [Terms of Service](https://onlyfans.com/terms), and we will process Personal Data to perform that contract (e.g. to fulfil transactions between Fans and Creators and process Creator earnings) and to enforce the terms of that contract.
    * **Legitimate interests:** We may process Personal Data if it is in our, or a third-party's, legitimate interests (as detailed in the table below). This may include, for example, investigating and responding to a report made through our [DMCA takedown procedure](https://onlyfans.com/dmca), to protect a Creator's intellectual property rights.
    * **Compliance with legal obligations:** We may process Personal Data to comply with applicable law, rules and regulations in the locations where we operate (e.g. complying with financial / tax reporting requirements).
    * **Task carried out in the public interest:** We may process Personal Data as necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. This may include, for example, reporting illegal activity to relevant law enforcement authorities, other governmental authorities and non-governmental organisations.
    
    We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.

11. Obtaining your Personal Data
    ============================
    
    We collect your Personal Data from the following categories of sources:
    
    * **Directly from you:** When you provide it to us directly to open an account and use the Services, when you update your Personal Data in your account, or by corresponding with us (e.g. User Data, Account Data). We may also process your Personal Data when you interact with us through our social media pages on third-party websites.
    * **Automatically or indirectly from you:** For example, through and as a result of your use of the Services (e.g. Transaction Data, Technical Data, Usage Data), if you sign-in to OnlyFans via third-party single sign-in, or if you connect a third-party account to your OnlyFans account.
    * **From our service providers:** For example, where permitted by applicable law, we receive Third-Party Onboarding Data and certain Technical Data from our third-party age and identity verification providers.
    
12. Sharing your Personal Data
    ==========================
    
    We share Personal Data with the following categories of third parties:
    
    * **Our third-party service providers:** Such as our IT, payment processing, customer support, content and text moderation, tax automation, and age and identity verification / age estimation service providers. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing Personal Data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests (namely the receipt of services to support business functionality).
    * **Our professional advisers:** Such as our legal advisors, bankers, auditors, accountants, consultants, and insurers. Our professional advisors will process Personal Data as necessary to provide their services to us. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing Personal Data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our legitimate interests (namely the receipt of professional services).
    * **Corporate:** Relevant third parties in the event of a possible sale, merger, acquisition, business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise. The lawful basis we rely on for sharing Personal Data with these recipients is that it is necessary for our and the relevant third parties' legitimate interests (namely assessing and putting into effect potential transactions).
    * **Our group companies:** For the centralised coordination and management of our business, in accordance with the purposes set out at **Section 8 (_categories of Personal Data_)**. These recipients will process Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Policy.

    * **Relevant authorities, regulators and organisations:** Relevant governmental authorities (including law enforcement and tax authorities), regulators, and certain non-governmental organisations (such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)). These recipients will use your Personal Data in the performance of their regulatory, legal or otherwise charitable or not-for-profit role. Depending on the context, the lawful basis we rely on for sharing Personal Data with these recipients may vary. The processing may be necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, necessary for our, or a third-party's, legitimate interests, or may be in the interest of the wider public to do so. This may include, for example, reporting illegal content to / assisting with requests from, authorities, regulators and organisations, to protect the safety of our users and third parties, and complying with our financial / tax reporting requirements (e.g. DAC7, in the European Union).
    
13. International data transfers
    ============================
    
    We share your Personal Data within our group companies and to our third parties, as set out at **Section 12 (_sharing your Personal Data_)**.
    
    In some circumstances, this will involve transferring your data outside the UK, the EEA and Switzerland. We make those transfers: (i) to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data; (ii) using appropriate safeguards; or (iii) where otherwise authorised by applicable law.
    
    Please contact us using the contact details set out at **Section 19 (_assistance and contact information_)** if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Data outside the UK, the EEA and Switzerland.

    Under certain circumstances and subject to certain exemptions, you have the right to:
    
    * **Withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data:** Please note that withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
    * **Request to know or access to your Personal Data:** You may receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    * **Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you:** You may correct any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data we hold about you.
    * **Request deletion / erasure of your Personal Data:** You may ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no legitimate reason for us continuing to process it. You also may ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below). Please note that we may not always be able to comply with your request of deletion / erasure for specific legal reasons, for example if your account has been deactivated for violations of our [Terms of Service](https://onlyfans.com/terms). Please see **Section 17 (_retention of Personal Data_)** for further information.
    * **Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data:** You may ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

    **You also have the right to object to processing of your Personal Data** where we are relying on a legitimate interest for the processing and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
    
    We do not process Personal Data that is subject to **solely automated decision-making**, where that decision-making is likely to have a legal or similarly significant effect on you.
    
    You also have the right:
    
    * **To lodge a complaint** with a data protection regulator. For example, in the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and in Switzerland, this is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). If you are resident in the EEA, you may wish to contact your local country or state-specific data protection regulator.
    * Depending on your location in the United States, **to not receive retaliatory or discriminatory treatment** in connection with a request to exercise the above rights, or **to appeal a decision** we have made in connection with your privacy rights request. Further information on appeals is set out at **Section 18 (_additional U.S. State Privacy Disclosures_)**.
    
15. Exercising your rights
    ======================
    
    If you would like to exercise your rights set out at **Section 14 (_your rights regarding Personal Data_)**, you may do so by contacting us using the contact details set out at **Section 19 (_assistance and contact information_)**.
    
    If you submit the request yourself, please ensure that your request contains sufficient information to allow us to confirm your identity and properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
    
    In order to verify your identity, we may at times need to request additional Personal Data from you, taking into consideration our relationship with you and the sensitivity of your request. In certain circumstances, we may decline a privacy rights request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity.
    
    If your request is made by a third-party authorised by you, we will also require proof that the third-party has permission to submit the request on your behalf (such as a signed document or a valid power of attorney evidencing that the third-party has authority to make the request).
    
16. Choices and control over your Personal Data
    ===========================================
    
    **Modifying and deleting your Personal Data:** If you have an account with us, you may update your [account settings](https://onlyfans.com/my/settings/account) on OnlyFans. Please note that changes to your settings may require some time to take effect.
    
    **Access to device information:** You may control the Services' access to your Technical Data through your "Settings" app on your device. For instance, you can withdraw permission for the Services to access your network devices and geolocation.
    
    **Email notification opt-out:** We currently do not send emails for direct marketing purposes. However, we do send email notifications which are related to your account (e.g. for Creators, where you have a new subscriber, you have received a new tip, or somebody has renewed their subscription with you). You may opt-out of receiving certain types of email communications from us by changing your [notification preferences](https://onlyfans.com/my/settings/notifications) on OnlyFans. You may also email us using the contact details set out at **Section 19 (_assistance and contact information_)**. Please include "E-mail notification opt-out" in the email's subject line and include your name and your account email address in the body of the email.
    
    Please note that you cannot opt-out of certain automated email notifications that are necessary to provide the Services or are otherwise required in accordance with applicable law (e.g. account verification, transactional communications, changes / updates to features of the service, technical and security notices).
    
17. Retention of Personal Data
    ==========================
    
    We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, as set out in this Policy. The Personal Data that we retain and the length of time for which it is retained will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the particular circumstances.
    
    We determine the periods for which we normally retain Personal Data as follows:
    
    * **Providing our Services**: Where we need to use Personal Data to provide you with our Services, or specific parts of our Services, we will retain your Personal Data for the lifetime of your account or as long as necessary to provide you with the relevant feature or functionality of our Services.
    * **Trust and safety**: If you have (or we reasonably suspect that you have) violated our [Terms of Service](https://onlyfans.com/terms), or where we otherwise need to retain information to identify and report illegal activity or protect the safety of our users and third parties, we will retain certain Personal Data for as long as necessary to conduct our investigations, assist with any investigations by law enforcement or non-governmental authorities (e.g. NCMEC), and enforce any removal of offending users or content.
    * **Compliance with applicable laws and regulatory obligations**: For example: (i) identity record keeping / maintenance requirements in certain locations and financial / tax reporting requirements, which in some cases is up to 7 years; (ii) if we receive a valid legal request (such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account); (iii) complying with regulatory investigations or proceedings. We will delete your Personal Data sooner where a shorter retention period is required by applicable law.
    * **Legal claims**: Personal Data will be retained in accordance with applicable statutory limitation periods. In certain circumstances we may need to retain this longer, for example, to defend ourselves in litigation about a claim or complaint related to you.
    
18. Additional U.S. State Privacy Disclosures

    Where required by law, these additional U.S. State Privacy Disclosures ("**U.S. Disclosures**") supplement the information contained in the Policy by providing additional information about our Personal Data processing practices relating to individual residents of certain U.S. States.
