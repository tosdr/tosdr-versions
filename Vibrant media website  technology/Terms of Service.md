**9\. TERM AND TERMINATION**

9.1 **Term and Renewals:** This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue subject to termination in accordance with its terms (**“Term”**).

9.2 Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon no less than ninety (90) days written notice to the other party.

9.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately by notice in writing to the other if the other party:

9.3.1 is in material breach of this Agreement and in the case of a breach capable of remedy fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Publisher removes any Ad Tags from Publisher Sites or otherwise blocks the operation of the Services without giving Vibrant appropriate notice of termination, such action shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement not capable of remedy. In all cases of material breach, and subject always to clause 11.8, Vibrant may withhold any and all payments due to Publisher under this Agreement for the two (2) months prior to such material breach and require Publisher to refund to Vibrant any payments already paid to Publisher by Vibrant for such two (2) month period; or

9.3.2 passes a resolution for winding up (otherwise than for the purposes of a solvent amalgamation or reconstruction) or a court makes an order to that effect; or

9.3.3 becomes or is declared insolvent or convenes a meeting of or makes or proposes to make any arrangement or composition with its creditors; or

9.3.4 has a liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, manager, trustee or similar officer appointed over any of its assets; or

9.3.5 ceases, or threatens to cease, to carry on business.

9.4 **Effect of Termination:** Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement: (a) subject to clause 9.3.1, all undisputed amounts payable in accordance with this Agreement that have accrued prior to expiration or termination will be payable in full within 90 Calendar Days hereof; (b) all rights and licenses of Publisher under the Agreement will terminate and Publisher shall remove all Ad Tags from the Publisher Sites and take all such other steps as Vibrant may reasonably request relating to the cessation of the Services; and (c) Vibrant’s obligations relating to the Services will terminate. Clauses 1.7, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, 8, 10 and 11 will survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.

**10\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY**

10.1 **Use and Disclosure Restrictions:** Each party will not use the other party’s Confidential Information except as necessary for the performance of the Agreement and will not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party except to its employees and subcontractors that need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of performing this Agreement, provided that each such employee and subcontractor is subject to a written agreement that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions that are at least as protective as those set out herein. Each party will use all reasonable endeavours to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information in its possession or control, but in no event shall it use less than the efforts that such party ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information of similar nature and importance.

10.2 **Permitted Disclosure:** The obligations in clause 10.1 will not restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party: (a) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body provided that the party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice (where permissible) to the other party to contest such order or requirement; and (b) on a confidential basis to its legal or financial advisors. In addition, each party may disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement: (i) as required under applicable securities regulations; and (ii) on a confidential basis to present or future providers of venture capital or potential private investors in or acquirers of such party.

10.3 **Publicity:** Without Vibrant’s prior written consent, Publisher shall not release any information regarding any Advertisements, Advertisers, or Publisher’s relationship with Vibrant or its customers, including, without limitation, in press releases or promotional or merchandising materials. Vibrant shall have the right to refer to its work for, and relationship with, the Publisher for marketing and promotional purposes. Save as set out above, no stand-alone press releases or general public announcements shall be made without the mutual consent of Vibrant and Publisher.

**11\. GENERAL**

11.1 **Waiver:** The failure of either party to enforce or to exercise at any time or for any period any term of or any right pursuant to this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any such term or right and shall in no way affect that party’s right later to enforce or exercise it.

11.2 **Notices:** All notices required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered by confirmed post or courier and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt. All communications will be sent to the addresses set forth in the Publisher Order Form or as may be specified by either party to the other in accordance with this clause.

11.3 **Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable then such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to attempt to substitute for any invalid or unenforceable provision a valid or enforceable provision which achieves to the greatest extent possible the same effect as would have been achieved by the invalid or unenforceable provision.

11.4 **Force Majeure:** Neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform or delay in performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control (a “Force Majeure Event”). The party so affected shall promptly notify the other party in writing of its reasons for the delay or stoppage. Provided the affected party complies with the notification requirement in this clause 11.4, its performance under this Agreement shall be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues and it will have a reasonable extension of time for performance of its obligations taking all circumstances into account. As regards the delay or stoppage arising from the Force Majeure Event (a) any costs arising from such delay or stoppage shall be borne by the party incurring those costs; and (b) each party shall take reasonable steps necessary to bring that event to a close or to find a solution by which obligations under this Agreement may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event. If the Force Majeure Event continues for more than one month, either party may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect on giving written notice to the other party.

11.5 **Relationship of parties:** Nothing in the Agreement will be construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other’s behalf without such other party’s prior written consent.

11.6 **Assignment:** Neither party may assign or transfer its rights and/or obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, without the other party’s written consent except in the event of a Change of Control (as defined below), in respect of which the other party’s consent shall be deemed to have been given. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this clause will be null and void. “Change of Control” means, with respect to a party: (a) the direct or indirect acquisition of either (i) the majority of voting stock of such party or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of such party, by another entity in a single transaction or a series of transactions; or (b) the merger of such party with another entity. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, the Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.

11.7 **Entire Agreement and Variation:** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all previous agreements, arrangements, undertakings or proposals (whether written or oral). The parties agree that, save as expressly set out herein, neither party has relied on, and will not have any liability for, any untrue statement or representation made by it (whether innocently or negligently) upon which the other party relied in entering into this Agreement, unless such untrue statement or representation was made fraudulently. This Agreement shall prevail over any inconsistent terms and conditions in any other agreement between the parties or referred to in correspondence or elsewhere and any conditions or stipulations to the contrary are hereby excluded and extinguished. This Agreement may be amended, modified or superseded, only by a written instrument signed by the parties hereto.

11.8 **Non-Exclusive Remedies:** The exercise by either party of any right or remedy under the Agreement will be without prejudice to its other rights or remedies under the Agreement, at law, in equity or otherwise.

11.9 **Equitable Relief:** Each party acknowledges that a breach by the other party of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provisions of this Agreement may cause the non-breaching party irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be adequate compensation. Consequently, the non-breaching party may institute an action to restrain the breaching party from any and all acts in violation of those provisions, which remedy will be cumulative and not exclusive, and a party may seek the entry of an injunction restraining any breach or threatened breach of those provisions, in addition to any other relief to which the non-breaching party may be entitled at law or in equity.

11.10 **No Third-party Beneficiaries:** A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall not have any rights under the Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party that exists or is available apart from that Act.

11.11 **Counterparts:** This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

11.12 **Governing Law:** This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes and claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and each party agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales over any claim or matter arising under or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).
