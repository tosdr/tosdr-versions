**2\. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGY**
----------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 We place advertisements on websites operated by our client publishers (i.e. through our Network). Our products include Vibrant In-Text Ads, Vibrant In-Image Ads and Vibrant Display Ads. For more information about our products, [click here](http://54.162.255.12/en/contact-us/). Other than serving advertisements as referred to above, we do not modify, control or influence any content on our client publishers’ websites.

2.2 Our technology is designed primarily to facilitate the delivery of contextual advertising. For example, we may place advertisements triggered from highlighted keywords within the text of web content on a client publisher’s website so that when you move your mouse over a word or phrase of interest, a relevant advertisement will appear (for example, an advertisement for cars which appears when you move your mouse over the word ‘car’ while reading an automotive news article).

2.3 We may collect information about a visitor’s interactions with the advertising we place on the Network, which we may use to provide more relevant advertisements aligned with your current interests. This process is called “Interest Matching”, and examples of how we may carry out Interest Matching are set out below:

2.3.1 One example is that, if you interact with one of our advertisements (for example, by hovering your mouse over one of the keywords we have underscored), we may use information about your interaction using cookies and other technologies (please see our [Cookie Statement](http://54.162.255.12/en/cookie-policy/) for more details) and draw inferences from your visit in order to provide you with an advertisement that is more relevant, interesting, and useful for you.

2.3.2 As another example, we may use our technology to identify a visitor’s interests by gathering web viewing data (e.g. web pages visited, browser type, referring URL, Internet service provider, a computer’s or device’s operating system, and date and time of visits) using cookies and other technologies (please see our [Cookie Statement](http://54.162.255.12/en/cookie-policy/) for more details).

2.3.3 We may also engage in behavioural retargeting that allows us and some of our advertising partners to display advertising to you when you are on a website in our Network, based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a website (which may or may not be part of our Network). For example, if you have visited the website of an online retailer, you may see ads on websites in our Network from that same retailer displaying the products that you were viewing on the retailer’s website.

2.3.4 In the case of all the examples above, the information collected and used does not include such personally identifiable information as your name, street address, e-mail address or telephone number.

2.4 Aggregate and non-personally identifiable web viewing and computer data is also collected and used for other purposes including advertisement delivery and reporting, measuring the effectiveness of a campaign, optimizing a campaign, and for operational purposes. We may also combine web viewing data with information (e.g. demographic data) provided by other entities to help make our advertiser clients’ advertising more relevant.

2.5 If you’d like to opt-out from having Vibrant Media collect your information for Interest Matching advertising as described in section 2.3 of this Privacy Policy, please see our [Cookie Statement](http://54.162.255.12/en/cookie-policy/). When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your browser. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your information to tailor our online advertisement campaigns. However, we may continue to collect certain data for basic ad serving and other purposes such as counting the number of times a keyword has been clicked.

2.6 Our legal bases for collecting and using this personal data are as follows: (a) consent – we will not place cookies on your browser if you do not give us consent to do so. You will continue to receive advertising through our technology but such advertising will be only contextual which means that it is being placed where you can see it based only on the words or images on the page of the website you are viewing. (b) legitimate interests including our interests in providing, improving, and customizing our technology for our clients and customers and providing you with relevant advertising and content, unless those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights requiring protection of personal information.

2.7 We process data primarily in the European Economic Area. However, we are a global company and occasionally will transfer data outside the EEA. In such instances, the data is pseudo-anonymised so that no data can be tied back to any user.

In addition, we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and may rely on the European Commission’s decisions about the adequacy of safeguards in certain countries, as applicable, including for data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries. You can contact us to request a copy of our Standard Contractual Clauses.

3.2.1 our website publisher clients that operate websites that use our technology, who may use their own cookies and other technologies to collect information about the content of the sites that you visit and the advertising that appears on those sites; and

In support of the EDAA and to provide consumers with enhanced transparency, we display the Ad Choices Icon advertisements delivered across our network to help consumers understand how their data is being used and provides choices for consumers who want more control. The Ad Choices icon is customarily displayed within the frame of our advertisement. The Ad Choices icon provides information (and links to other information) on online ads, who may be collecting and using online data, and how you can exercise choice with respect to those companies participating in the EDAA program.
