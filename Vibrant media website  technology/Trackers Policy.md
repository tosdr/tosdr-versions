**4\. THIRD-PARTY IP ADDRESS PROCESSING ACTIVITIES**
----------------------------------------------------

We may also process IP addresses to collect other information in order to display more geographically targeted advertisements to you, to limit the number of times you see advertisements, and fraud detection. This may include data about the country, city or region where you are located and the domain name from which you are accessing the internet (e.g. what ISP you use). We then place advertisements onto Our Websites that we believe people in advertising segment will find relevant.
