Privacy Policy
--------------

The purpose of this privacy policy (the “**Privacy Policy**”) is to inform you about our privacy practices, including how we collect, use and disclose your Personal Information (as defined herein). We respect your privacy and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy while online at our websites, together with any other websites, applications and services offered by Valnet (collectively, the “**Sites**” and individually, a “**Site**”) and as such, the following further discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the Sites.  

This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 6, 2024.

##### PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES

This Privacy Policy is current as of the “updated” date which appears at the top of this page. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, they will become immediately effective when published in a revised Privacy Policy posted on the Sites, unless otherwise noted. We may also communicate the changes through our services or by other means we deem appropriate, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. By submitting your Personal Information to us, by registering for or using any of the services we offer, by using our Sites, or by voluntarily interacting with us, you consent to our collecting, using and disclosing your Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy, as revised from time to time.

##### DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

"**Personal Information**" means information about an identifiable individual. This information may include, without limitation, your name, mailing address (including postal code or zip code), e-mail address, telephone number and payment information.

Personal Information does not include any business contact information that is solely used to communicate with you in relation to your employment, business or profession, such as, without limitation, your name, position name or title, work address, work telephone number, work fax number or work electronic address.

Personal Information also does not include information that has been anonymized or aggregated in such a way that there is no serious possibility it can be used to identify an individual, whether on its own or in combination with other information.

##### LEGAL OWNERSHIP

The Sites are owned and operated by Valnet Inc. (“**Valnet**”, “**us**” or “**we**”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada, having its head office at 7405 Transcanada Highway, Suite 100, Saint-Laurent, Quebec H4T 1Z2, and/or its subsidiaries.

##### YOUR CONSENT TO COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE

We collect, use and disclose your Personal Information with your consent or as permitted or required by applicable privacy laws. How we obtain your consent (i.e., the form we use) will depend on the circumstances, as well as the sensitivity of the information collected. Subject to applicable laws, your consent may be express or implied, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the Personal Information in question.

If you choose to provide Personal Information to us, we assume that you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as we deem appropriate.

If you wish to withdraw your consent to our collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information, please contact us at [data@valnetinc.com](mailto:data@valnetinc.com). However, before we implement the withdrawal of consent, we may require proof of your identity. In some cases, withdrawal of your consent may mean that we will no longer be able to provide certain products or services.

If you provide Personal Information about another individual to us, it is your responsibility to obtain the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use and disclose his or her information as described in this Privacy Policy under all applicable circumstances.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Sites.

If you are based in the European Economic Area (the “**EEA**”), a consent window will appear when accessing our Sites.

In the event that we become aware of any data security breach, alteration, unauthorized access or disclosure of any Personal Information, we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your information and will notify you as required by all applicable laws.

We have implemented physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures with a view of protecting your Personal Information and other information from loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. We have taken steps to ensure that the only personnel who are granted access to your Personal Information are those with a business ‘need-to-know’ or whose duties reasonably require such information.Despite the measures outlined above, no method of information transmission or information storage is absolutely secure or error-free, and as such, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

We store your Personal Information for twelve (12) months, or longer if permitted by law. This means we may retain your Personal Information even after you close your account with us.When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:

* Whether we are subject to any legal obligations (e.g., any laws that require us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time before we can delete them); and
* Whether we have taken any legal positions (e.g., in connection with any statutes of limitation).

Rather than delete your information, we might de-identify it by removing identifying details.

* Your social security number;
* Your racial or ethnic origin;
* Your political opinions;
* Your religion or other beliefs;
