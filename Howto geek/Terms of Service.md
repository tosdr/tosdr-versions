##### Copyright Policy

As we respect the intellectual property rights of others, Valnet has a policy of removing user submissions and other content that violates copyright law, pursuant to Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to proper notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov). It is expected that all users of any part of the Sites will comply with applicable copyright laws. If, however, we receive proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to such notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating contributors, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction. If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the creator of the affected content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.

Upon receipt of proper notification of claimed infringement, Valnet will follow the procedures outlined herein and in the DMCA.

To file a notice of infringement with Valnet, you must provide a written communication (by email, fax and mail) that sets forth the information specified in the list below.

Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorney’s fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyright(s). Accordingly, if you are not sure if you are the proper copyright holder or if copyright laws protect the material of yours, you may want to consult an attorney.

To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format:

* Your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which you, as the complaining party, may be contacted;
* The statement: “I am the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf of the following copyrighted material:”;
* Identify with sufficient detail the copyrighted content that you believe has been infringed. (For example, “The copyrighted image at issue is the “Content Title” which can be described as “Description: literary work, image, etc.” by “name of the author”, including any federal registration information if available);
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Valnet to locate the material (e.g. “Title of Article” at this location: \[URL/link-to-article\];
* The following statement: “I have a good faith belief that use of the aforementioned material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law”;
* The following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate”; and
* Sign the document

Subject to prior written agreement you may not communicate the information specified below by email. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is not infringing the copyrights of others.

You must follow these rules to encourage positive conversations and foster a healthy community:

* **Be Kind and Positive:** Maintain a friendly and positive attitude in your interactions with others. Avoid unconstructive negativity and strive to create a welcoming environment.
* **Do Not Feed The Trolls:** If you encounter disruptive behaviour (or “trolling”), refrain from engaging directly. Instead, wait for an administrator or moderator to intervene and address the issue.

* **Avoid Fanbase Conflicts:** Do not participate in fanbase “wars” or engage in intentionally inflammatory remarks aimed at specific fandoms. Keep discussions constructive and respectful.
* **No Spamming:** Avoid spamming the community with repetitive or irrelevant content. Contribute meaningfully to discussions and avoid excessive self-promotion.
* **Respect Spoiler Policies:** Refrain from sharing spoilers for movies, TV shows, games, or comics without appropriate warning. If an article has a red spoiler warning, feel free to discuss the spoilers for that specific movie, TV episode, game, etc.
* **Stay On-Topic:** Keep discussions focused on the subject matter at hand. Avoid off-topic comments, including discussions about politics or religion, unless directly relevant to the article or content being discussed.
* **Constructive Criticism:** It is acceptable to disagree with the opinions of authors and other commenters, express frustration with news or updates from companies and/or franchises, or provide constructive criticism. However, you must do so in a respectful and constructive manner, without resorting to insults or defamation against Valnet, the Sites, its authors, other commenters, or the moderation team.
* **Provide Us Feedback:** We want to hear from you, whether it is for a correction, an issue on the Site, a commenter breaking one of our rules above, etc. Contact us at **[legal@valnetinc.com](mailto:legal@valnetinc.com)**.
