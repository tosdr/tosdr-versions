If Campaign Operator asserts a good faith dispute of any amount invoiced by Wyng, Campaign Operator must notify Wyng in writing of the dispute, in reasonable detail, no later than the payment due date.

Wyng will, at its expense, defend Campaign Operator and pay any damages or settlement awarded or approved by a court of final jurisdiction arising out of any third-party claim, suit or action against Campaign Operator alleging that the Services, infringe, violate or misappropriate such third party’s United States trade secret, copyright or patent rights.

In the event that the Services are or are likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement, then Wyng, at its sole option and expense, shall (i) modify the Services or so that they are non-infringing, but functionally similar; (ii) procure for Campaign Operator the right to continue to use the allegedly infringing Services; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing are commercially reasonable, terminate this Agreement, direct Campaign Operator to cease use of the allegedly infringing Services and refund on a pro-rata basis any prepaid Services fees as of the effective date of termination.

Wyng shall have no obligation of indemnification as set forth herein if (i) the claim is based upon any combination of the Services with equipment, software or services not provided by Wyng if such claim would have been avoided but for such combination; (ii) the Services have been modified by a party other than Wyng or its authorized representatives; (iii) Campaign Operator continues use of the allegedly infringing Services after written notice to cease such use; (iv) the claim is based upon unauthorized use of the Services by Campaign Operator, Users or Participants; or (v) if the claim is based upon the breach by Campaign Operator of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

13.2. Indemnification by Campaign Operator. Campaign Operator will, at its expense, defend Wyng and pay any damages or settlement awarded or approved by a court of final jurisdiction arising out of any third party claim, suit or claim against Wyng: (i) alleging that the Campaign Design Materials infringe, violate or misappropriate such third party’s United States trade secret, trademark, copyright, privacy or publicity rights; (ii) resulting from a dispute between Campaign Operator and a Participant; (iii) resulting from Campaign Operator’s failure to adhere to the terms and conditions of applicable Third Party Sites; or (iv) resulting from Campaign Operator’s failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulation that govern collection and use of Personal Data.

13.3. Conditions. The parties’ obligations under this Section are conditioned upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim under this Section, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s) at the indemnifying party’s request and expense. The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment that imposes additional obligations on the indemnified party, without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, not to be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section are subject to the limitations and exclusions set forth in Section 19 (Limitation of Liability), and are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies in the event of an applicable third-party claim.

14\. CONFIDENTIALITY

For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” shall mean any proprietary or confidential information of a party hereto (the “Disclosing Party”) disclosed to the other party hereto (the “Receiving Party”), before, on or after the Effective Date and furnished in any form, including written, oral, visual, or electronic form and/or in any other media or manner. Confidential Information includes all proprietary technologies, know-how, trade secrets, discoveries, inventions and any other intellectual property (whether or not patented), analyses, compilations, Services, software programs, methodologies, processes, business, financial or technical information and other materials prepared by either party, containing or based in whole or in part on any such Confidential Information. The terms, conditions and existence of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information.

Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement, (ii) is already known by the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s written records, (iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source that is entitled to disclose it on a non-confidential basis, or (iv) was or is independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s written records. In the event the Receiving Party is required to disclose such Confidential Information pursuant to law, regulation or court or administrative order, prior to making any such legally required disclosure, the Receiving Party shall notify in writing the Disclosing Party as soon as is practicable under the circumstances in order that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order.

The Receiving Party agrees that it will not use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder and will not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third party other than its employees who have a need to know such Confidential Information and are advised of the terms and conditions of this Section and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Section. The Receiving Party shall treat and protect such Confidential Information in the same manner as it treats its own Confidential Information of like character, but with not less than reasonable care.

Upon written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall immediately cease its use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and within thirty (30) days either return or destroy (and certify as to such destruction) all Confidential Information, including any copies thereof. The obligations of this Section shall continue for a period of three (3) years after termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of confidentiality with respect to a trade secret of Wyng shall continue for so long as Wyng protects such trade secret as a trade secret pursuant to the laws of the State of New York in the United States of America.

The Receiving Party will promptly inform the Disclosing Party of any verified unauthorized disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, including any verified breach of security of the Services or Hosting Environment resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of Participant Personal Data or Campaign Operator Data. The parties will cooperate to implement prompt measures to mitigate further unauthorized disclosures. Wyng may, without Campaign Operator’s consent, communicate with law enforcement personnel, service providers, insurance providers, and other relevant personnel to resolve or address such incident, but will not issue communications to Participants without prior notification to and approval of Campaign Operator (unless prohibited by law). Campaign Operator will not make any public statement or issue any public communication regarding any incident described in this Section, without Wyng’s prior written consent, except as required by law.
