The provisions of these Terms of Use are intended to be severable.

**15\. APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION**
-------------------------------------

**16\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**
---------------------------

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND BARNES & NOBLE TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.

Any dispute or claim arising from, relating to, or connected with these Terms of Use, the Barnes & Noble Services, the Barnes & Noble Content including Digital Content, any Barnes & Noble account and/or any Digital Library (each a “Claim”) will be resolved by binding arbitration (rather than in court). All Claims submitted to arbitration under these Terms of Use will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be the State of New York or, where limited by applicable law, the jurisdiction in which you reside or may be conducted by telephone, online or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required. Notwithstanding this Section 16, we may bring a Claim for injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or those of our affiliates, suppliers, or licensors.

WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS. We each agree that any Claim will be arbitrated or litigated, as the case may be, on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with any Claim of any other party whether through class action proceedings, class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. WE EACH AGREE THAT WE ARE KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVING ANY RIGHT WE MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE DIGITAL CONTENT TERMS OF SALE.

OPTION TO OPT-OUT. To opt out of the arbitration and class-action waiver terms in this Section 16, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept these Terms and Conditions of Use (unless a longer period is required by applicable law). You must mail your written notification to Barnes & Noble, Attention: Legal Department to 33 East 17th St., New York, New York 10003 and your written notification must include your name, address and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.

You acknowledge and agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any Claim or cause of action you may have must be filed within one (1) calendar year after such Claim or cause of action arises, or forever be barred.

For purposes of any Claim that is not subject to the arbitration procedures in this Section 16, we both agree to the governing law and jurisdiction as set out in Section 15.1 above.

**17\. EXPORT**
