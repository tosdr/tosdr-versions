### Cookies

Like many online retailers, we and/or our third-party providers use cookies to recognize you as you use or return to the Barnes & Noble Websites. This is done so that we can personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. “Cookies” are small files that are placed in your browser to collect information about your activities on a Barnes & Noble Website. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you; (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it; (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our marketing efforts and communications; and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of ads displayed.

Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. To learn more about the types of cookies that we use and how to manage your cookie settings please click here to access our [Cookie Policy](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/h/help/cookie-policy).

### Pixel tags or clear GIFs

We may use sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to determine the effectiveness of our email and advertising and marketing efforts. For this purpose, we tie the pixel tags and clear GIFs to personally identifiable information. We may also collect information regarding the links within such marketing materials that you click on and purchase statistics regarding items you buy following receipt of such marketing.

You may see these advertisements on Barnes & Noble Websites and third party apps and websites, and across different devices you use. Barnes & Noble does not control these third party cookies. We may use this process to help us manage and improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Some of our advertising partners also enable us to translate your email address or phone number into an identifier that can’t be used to identify you personally. Our advertising partners then use that unique identifier to show ads that are more relevant to you across the web and in mobile apps. If you would like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware of the fact that you visit Barnes & Noble Websites or use our Apps, and to understand your opt-out choices, please visit the website of the National Advertising Initiative here or Digital Advertising Alliance, by visiting [www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/).

Some of the activities described in this section may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under certain laws. Depending on where you reside, you may, have the right to opt out of targeted advertising, sharing, and sales of your personal information. You may opt out of cookie-based targeted advertising and sharing by visiting the Barnes & Noble Privacy Preference Center and opting out of “Targeting Cookies.” You may opt-out of non-cookie based targeted advertising, sharing, and sales by visiting our Data Rights Request portal and selecting “Do Not Sell my data to third parties”, located here. Please note that these actions do not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Barnes & Noble is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of Minors under the age of 16, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

Except as noted below: (i) our products and services are marketed for and directed towards purchase by adults or with the consent of adults; (ii) Individuals under the age of 18 (“Minors”) are not permitted to use Barnes & Noble Websites or Apps without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian; (iii) we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information on the Barnes & Noble Websites; and (v) should we learn that someone under the age of 16 has provided any personal information to or on any of the Barnes & Noble Websites, we will remove that information as soon as possible.

We do not knowingly sell or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16.

If we direct certain Devices features or Apps to Minors who may be under the age of 16, we require the parent or legal guardian to provide verifiable consent to such Minor’s use of our products and services and our collection of personal information in connection with such use. In these cases, we require validation of credit card information already on file with us and we will then email the master account holder to give notice that we have received such consent. If no credit card information is on file, or if the credit card is invalid, we will not register that you have consented. With your consent, we may collect, use and share information regarding Minors under the age of 16 consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see the sections above for detailed information on how we do so.

If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your Minor under the age of 16 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact [privacy@barnesandnoble.com](mailto:privacy@barnesandnoble.com). Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, we will promptly provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how it has been used or shared. We will, at your request, remove personal information about your child from its database and instruct our affiliates to do the same.

If you are a Minor under the age of 18, you may request and obtain removal of certain content or information posted on Barnes & Noble Websites and Apps by sending an email to [privacy@barnesandnoble.com](mailto:privacy@barnesandnoble.com) with “Privacy Rights for Minors” in the subject line.

One such law is the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”). These consumer privacy laws grant their residents certain rights and require additional disclosures (“State Privacy Laws”). If you are a resident of one of a state that has enacted State Privacy Laws, this section applies to you.

### Personal Information Collected and Shared

Certain State Privacy Laws, including the CCPA, require us to disclose what categories of information we have collected in the last twelve months and what categories of information we have “shared” or “sold” as those terms are defined under California law. You can find a list of the categories of information that we have collected and shared or sold, as those terms are defined under applicable State Privacy Laws [here](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/h/help/california-information-sharing-disclosure). Please note that because these lists are comprehensive, they may refer to types of information that we share about people other than yourself. If you would like more information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing please submit a written request to us using the information in the “Contact Information” section below. We do not discriminate against consumers who exercise any of their rights described in this policy.

You can find additional information regarding the number of requests Barnes & Noble received and responded to under the CCPA [here](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/h/help/ccpa-requests).

### Shine the Light

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. We qualify for this alternative option. To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please visit the following link: [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](https://bn.clarip.com/dsr/create?type=3).

### Important information about third party devices, ISPs, websites and applications

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Barnes & Noble enterprise. Whenever you click on links and banners on any Barnes & Noble Website that take you to a third-party website or you use, download or install third party software applications onto your Device, your use of those third party websites and/or software will be subject to the third party’s privacy policies, not Barnes & Noble’s. Additionally, please note that when using Barnes & Noble Websites or Apps, third party mobile device manufacturers and internet service providers (ISPs) may collect personal information about you and your use of such third-party products and services will be subject to the third party’s privacy policies.

In addition, our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Barnes & Noble. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.

### Notice of Financial Incentive and Bona Fide Loyalty Programs

We provide price discounts, coupons, services, and other benefits for (1) members of our Barnes & Noble Premium Membership Program, Barnes & Noble Rewards, Em & Friends — Friends with Benefits, Paper Source Marketing Program, Cafe and other customer programs; (2) large volume customers; (3) members of our mailing list; and (4) Barnes & Noble Account Holders (collectively “Programs”).

Through these offerings, customers provide us with the necessary personal information (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers, etc.) when they opt-in to our programs. There is no obligation to opt-in and customers may opt-out at any time. The details of each Program are contained in the terms and conditions for each Program. We offer these Programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. We invest heavily in our marketing and brands, in part, so we can provide Programs to our customers. The value to our business of customers’ personal information is dependent on specific facts such as whether and to what extent they, in the aggregate, take advantage of any offerings and whether and to what extent they opt-out of any offerings. Our ability to create any value from the Programs is heavily based on our ability to leverage said intellectual properties. We do not calculate the value of customer data in our accounting statements. To the extent we create overall value from our Programs to our business that could be directly or reasonably related to the value of customer data in the aggregate, the method for calculating same would include: the costs associated with (1) our intellectual property; (2) enhancing customer data by our marketing team’s efforts; (3) leveraging our significant investments in understanding you as our existing and future customers; (4) all other costs reasonably related to the programs and (5) for each program, and in the aggregate, whether the sales generated by the program(s) exceed the cost to us of offering them. We estimate that the value of these Programs is at least equal to the value of the information you provide when you participate in them.

You can opt-in to, or opt-out of, our Programs at any time through the same means they are offered, or by emailing our Customer Service Department by calling Customer Service at 1-800-THE-BOOK **\[1-800-843-2665\]**.
