Library Computers & WiFi
------------------------

The Kenosha Public Library understands that for many people, library computers are the only way to connect to the digital world. According to the 2020 census, ~_17%_ of the residents within the City of Kenosha lack access to high-speed internet and a home computer. While no computer system is 100% secure, to help ensure your digital privacy and online security, KPL has taken the following actions:

* Installed "reboot to restore" software on all public computers. All personal information, logins, and any installed software are wiped from the computer when it's rebooted.
* Installed and maintain anti-malware software on library-owned computers.
* Ensured that all network traffic on library-owned computers is encrypted from point of origin to its final destination (aka end-to-end encryption).
* Encrypted the data on all servers, staff workstations, and staff laptops.
* Disabled all unused physical networking ports.

In addition, we are in the development of a fully secure WiFi network for patrons. In the future, patrons will be able to connect to the Library's wireless network via their library card number to have a more secure connection at every library location.

Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
-------------------------------------

The Kenosha Public Library uses [Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), opens a new window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification) for inventory control and systems automation. This system uses tags to help with:

* Checking out of items;
* Checking in and sorting returned items (such as the automated returns system at Northside); and
* Allowing staff to conduct quicker inventories of items on the shelves.

The tags are encoded with only the item's barcode number and do not contain any personal information or other identifying information. With this system in place, the library has been able to retrain and deploy staff to other functions such as the bookmobiles, adult & youth events, and home delivery services.

Visits to MyKPL.info
--------------------

When you visit mykpl.info, the following basic information is automatically received and stored by the web servers hosting mykpl.info:

* The originating Internet Protocol (IP) address;
* The internet domain name;
* Information about your computer or mobile set-up (e.g., type and version of web browser, operating system, screen resolution, and connection speed);
* The pages on mykpl.info that you visit; and
* The internet address, or URL, of the website that connected you to our site, if you accessed mykpl.info via a link on another page (e.g., “referral traffic”).

The Kenosha Public Library also uses web measurement and customization technologies (such as “cookies”). You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including mykpl.info, by changing your browser settings.

Social Media
------------

The Kenosha Public Library maintains official pages or accounts on third-party websites in order to better engage with patrons. Your activity on those sites is governed by the third-party website’s security and privacy policies. Users of third-party sites often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third party operating the site. Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of third-party sites (listed below) before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be shared and used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party site to match your preferences.

To comply with [Wisconsin Open Records](https://www.doj.state.wi.us/office-open-government/office-open-government-resources) laws, the Kenosha Public Library may archive information that users submit or publish when engaging with the library through official pages or accounts on third-party websites (e.g., by sending a message, posting a comment, “following,” “friending,” or taking similar actions). This information may contain personal information, such as an individual’s username and other public account information, when such information is available based on the user’s privacy settings and the terms of the site.

For aggregate statistical analysis and to improve the quality of our services, we may integrate web measurement tools with our social media pages. These tools enable a basic analysis of social media traffic (such as the number of people visiting a certain page) and do not collect personally identifiable information.

eMail Subscriptions
-------------------

In order to manage the Kenosha Public Library email subscription lists, we retain the names and email addresses of our email subscribers, logs of emails we send, and automatically generated email data used to improve our email communications. This automatically generated email data (generated through simple tools such as “pixel tags” and link redirects) includes:

* The recipient’s email client;
* Whether the email was opened;
* If a link in the message was clicked; and
* Whether an email was delivered;

If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving our messages, simply click on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email message.

How Information is Used
-----------------------

The Kenosha Public Library may use the information provided via contact forms or during registration to contact you, respond to your message, or provide you with the information or services you requested. In order to serve you better, we may analyze multiple sources of data you have provided (for example, to look up whether you previously contacted the library about the same topic so that we do not send you a duplicative response). We may also use messages, comments, or usage statistics collected through mykpl.info, the SHARE catalog, or official social media pages for our own purposes, such as to inform library collection decisions or in public advocacy.

We may use data you provide and automatically generated data for statistical analysis to assess, for example, what information is of interest to users, technical design specifications, and system performance. This allows us to make general improvements to our site as well as to offer tailored content to email subscribers (e.g., a newsletter to subscribers interested in a specific topic based on information they have provided or automatically generated data).
