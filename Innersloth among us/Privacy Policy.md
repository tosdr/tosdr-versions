Privacy Policy and Notice at Collection
=======================================

**Effective Date: July 1, 2023**
--------------------------------

Below is our Privacy Policy. It is long, but worth the read as it explains how we use your personal information. At a high-level, we wanted to explain what personal information we process for Among Us and our website.

**Among Us:**

* To protect our child users, we use your date of birth, country, and IP address to verify whether you are a child.
* To create an account, we will collect your username, IP address, and email address. If you are a child user, we will send your parent’s email to Kids Web Services, so your parent can set your permissions regarding personal information for our game.
* To link your account with another game platform account, we will use your username and online IDs, and in some cases, your IP address and email address.
* If you buy something in-game, we may receive additional personal information to fulfill those purchases such as your name, address, and payment information.
* If you are in a lobby when another user reports you for violations of our Terms of Use or other inappropriate conduct, your username, IP address, and gameplay information may be stored for moderation purposes.
* If you reach out to us directly, we may use that information to help fix the problem you reported.
* We do not collect any sensitive information from you, such as your precise geolocation, or sell or share your personal information for ads or profiling purposes.
* Please do not put private information in your username or chat. Someone may use or save it even if we do not.

**Website:**

* If you buy something on our website, we will use your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, payment information, and purchase history to fulfill those orders.
* If you sign up for our marketing newsletter, we will use the email address you provide.
* If you reach out to us directly, we may use the information provided to help fix the problem you reported.

* * *

Innersloth LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**,” and their derivatives) provides websites, including [www.innersloth.com](http://www.innersloth.com/) and its subdomains (collectively, the “**Website**”), the videogame known as “Among Us” (the “**Game**”), and other online services (collectively, with the Website and the Game, the “**Services**”).

**1**. **What does this Policy cover?** 

This Privacy Policy and Notice at Collection (this “**Policy**”) sets forth how we collect, use, protect, store, disclose, and otherwise process your Personal Information (defined below). Because we do not process any Personal Information for our videogames known as “Dig2China,” “Henry Stickmin Collection,” and “Among Us VR,” those games are not covered by this Policy. You should review Schell Games’ [Privacy Policy](https://schellgames.com/among-us-vr-privacy-policy) for more information about how it collects, uses, and shares the Personal Information it obtains and uses for “Among Us VR.”

This Policy also does NOT apply to information you provide to any third party or is collected by any third party (except as otherwise provided below).

By using our Services, you are confirming that you understand English well enough to understand this Policy. Should you have questions about this Policy, please contact us by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://innersloth.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or mailing your questions to Innersloth LLC, PO Box 2532, Redmond, WA 98073, USA.

**2\. How do we process Children’s Personal Information?** 

A “**Child**” is a person under the age needed to consent to the processing of Personal Information in their country of residence (for example, 13 years old in the United States and between 13 and 16 years old in the European Union). Please see below for a summary of our practices with respect to the collection of Personal Information from Children and the use and disclosure of such information.

Quick-Chat Mode

If a user of our Game self-identifies or is identified by us as being a Child (each, a “**Child User**”), their gameplay experience will automatically be set to “Quick-Chat Mode,” unless the parent or legal guardian of the Child permits otherwise. Child Users in Quick-Chat Mode are restricted from communicating with or otherwise making their Personal Information publicly available to other users of our Game. Child Users will only be able to use a set of fixed phrases to communicate with other users in Quick-Chat Mode and will not have links to social media in our Game. Each of these features is designed to limit our access and the access of other users of our Game to the Personal Information of Child Users in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (“**COPPA**”).

Accounts

Child Users may register an account with us using a registration process similar to the one adults go through; however, in compliance with COPPA, Child Users will first be subject to a parental notice and verified parental consent process. To initiate the registration and consent process for a Child User, we collect a parent or legal guardian’s email address. We will automatically generate randomized usernames for registered Child Users, unless the parent or legal guardian grants the Child User permission to create a custom username.

Child Users using an Apple or Google family sharing account are not permitted to register another account with us and are subject to the most restrictive privacy settings in the Game.

Use and Disclosure

The Personal Information we collect from or about Child Users is used to give them access to certain features of our Game and communicate with a parent or legal guardian about the Child User’s registration, including for the purpose of verifying their information in connection with the registration. We do not share or otherwise disclose Child Users’ Personal Information, except (1) as may be necessary to protect the safety of a Child, including by disclosing their Personal Information, where appropriate, to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety; (2) to enable us to take precautions against liability; (3) to protect the integrity, safety, and security of our Game; or (4) where required to do so by law or legal process.

We and the third-party service providers listed below may collect or maintain Child Users’ Personal Information through our Game. You should review their privacy policies linked below.

* [Kids Web Services](https://www.kidswebservices.com/privacy-policy) (a parental and legal guardian consent management provider);
* [Zendesk, Inc.](https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/privacy-notice/) and [Keywords Studios Plc](https://www.keywordsstudios.com/privacy-policy/) (each a player support service provider);
* [ModSquad, Inc.](https://modsquad.com/privacy-and-cookies) (a moderation service provider); and
* [Epic Games, Inc.](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy) (in its capacity as a backend service provider (for example, for account management and linking)).

When a parent or legal guardian consents to permitting their Child User’s account to be linked with any of the below third party digital content stores and game platforms, we may receive such Child User’s Personal Information through our Game. You should review their privacy policies linked below.

* [Itch Corp.](https://itch.io/docs/legal/privacy-policy);

Please contact us with questions about our service providers’ privacy policies and our collection and use practices by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://innersloth.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject line “Children’s Privacy” or mailing your request to Innersloth LLC, PO Box 2532, Redmond, WA 98073, USA.

At any time, a parent or legal guardian may review their Child’s Personal Information retained by us, require us to correct or delete such Personal Information, request that we delete their Child’s account, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using their Child’s Personal Information by contacting us using the email or mailing address provided above. To protect parents and legal guardians’ privacy and security and the privacy and security of Child Users, we may require a parent or legal guardian to take certain steps or provide additional information, which we will keep strictly confidential, to verify their identity before we provide any information about the Child or take the requested actions.

Kids Web Services

Our Game is provided and operated by us. However, some functionalities of our Game, including the parent portal and contact with parents for purposes of obtaining verified parental consent and informing parents of their Child User’s online activities, are operated by Kids Web Services (“**KWS**”).

**8\. How is my Personal Information protected?**

Our Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies

We protect your Personal Information through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.

* _Limited retention_: We retain each category of Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Use if your account has been banned or your access to our Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Information if we stop operating our Game or the feature through which the Personal Information was acquired.

* _Purpose limitation_: We will use your Personal Information only for our Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.  

* _Security measures_: We use reasonable security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification, including industry-standard encryption for the transmitting of Personal Information (e.g., DTLS, TLS 1.2+, HTTPS) and industry-standard hashing techniques for the retention of Personal Information (e.g., SHA256+Salt). As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Policy does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach to the extent required by applicable law.

**9.** **How do we treat Personal Information transferred to the United States?**

Place of Business

We may store or process your Personal Information outside of the country where we collect the information or the country in which you reside. Our primary place of business is in the United States. You should understand that we may transfer some or all of your Personal Information to the United States to carry out certain operational and processing needs as described in this Policy.

Transfer Mechanisms

When transferring Personal Information out of foreign countries, we implement technical, organizational, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information. We use European Commission approved standard contractual clauses and implement related measures where required by applicable law. Please contact us if you have questions related to the relevant transfer mechanism for your Personal Information.

**10\. What rights do you have to your Personal Information?**

Right to Access, Correct, Delete, or Restrict Processing

Subject to any limitations and exceptions under applicable law, you have the right to request access to your Personal Information and exercise the below rights. 

* You have the right to correct or update certain types of Personal Information. In many cases, you can review or update your account information by accessing your account online.

* You have the right to request deletion of your Personal Information. If you choose to have your Personal Information removed from our Services, we will carry out your request within 30 days of account verification, subject to extension, and we will only retain minimal Personal Information to document your request and the actions we took to carry out your request.

* You have the right to restrict certain processing of your Personal Information and the right to object to some types of processing of your Personal Information. 

* You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

* You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our collection, storage, or processing of your Personal Information with a data protection supervisory authority in the country where you live or work.

We will comply with your requests in accordance with, and subject to, applicable law. For example, we are not required to delete your Personal Information if we have an overriding legitimate ground for retaining that information, such as to prevent fraud. Please note that we are legally prohibited from carrying out requested actions in some instances, including (1) when we are unable to confirm your identity or (2) where doing so would adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others. Further, we are not required to carry out a requested action in some instances, including where the request is considered excessive.

State Privacy Laws

The following applies to California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia residents (in the event of a conflict between this Section 11 and any other section in this Policy, this Section 11 controls):

* _Right to Know and Access_: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you the following, to the extent retained by us:
    
    * the categories of Personal Information we collected about you;
    
    * the categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you;
    
    * our business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing that Personal Information;
    
    * the categories of third parties with whom we disclose that Personal Information;
    
    * the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also known as a data portability request); and
    
    * if we sold or shared your Personal Information, two separate lists disclosing (1) sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased, and (2) disclosures for a business or operational purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

* _Right to Deletion_: You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers and contractors to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception under applicable law applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers or contractors to:
    
    * complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide our Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
    
    * help to ensure the security and integrity of our Services to the extent the use of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary and proportionate to those purposes;
    
    * debug our Services to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
    
    * exercise free speech, ensure the right of another user to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
    
    * comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act;
    
    * engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Personal Information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided consent;
    
    * enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with user expectations based on your relationship with us and compatible with the context in which you provided the Personal Information; or
    
    * comply with a legal obligation.

* _Right to Correction_: You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate Personal Information, taking into account to the nature of the Personal Information and the purposes of the processing of the Personal Information.

No Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights under applicable law. Unless permitted by applicable law, we will not:

* deny you our Services;
* charge you different prices or rates for our Services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
* provide you a different level or quality of our Services; or
* suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for our Services or a different level or quality of our Services.

Verifiable Consumer Requests

To exercise your rights described above, please email us at [\[email protected\]](https://innersloth.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject line “State Privacy Rights” or mail your request to Innersloth LLC, PO Box 2532, Redmond, WA 98073, USA. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. The verifiable consumer request must:

* provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative; and
* describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable consumer request, unless you request a longer period of time for Personal Information we collected about you after January 1, 2022. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

To appeal a decision regarding your verifiable consumer request, please submit your appeal using one of the two methods above. Your appeal should include an explanation of the reason you disagree with our decision. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable, easy-to-understand, and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

**12\. How will we notify you of changes to this Policy?**

We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time consistent with applicable law. If we make changes to this Policy, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy and provide you with additional notice such as an in-Game notice or email notification.

In the event that any changes we make to this Policy affect Child Users in a way that requires prior parental consent under COPPA, we will obtain such prior parental consent.
