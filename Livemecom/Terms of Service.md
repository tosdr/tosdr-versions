****8\. Features of the Service - Virtual Items****

A. The Service offers a feature allowing users to purchase (a) virtual currency (non-convertible, no cash value, non-refundable), including but not limited to virtual coins (“Coins”) for use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-Service items (“Gifts”). Any Coins and/or Gifts that are credited to Users within the Service are converted to Virtual “Diamonds” in the receiving User’s User account. Virtual Coins, together with Gifts and Diamonds, are hereafter collectively referred to as “Virtual Items”. ****The purchase of any Virtual Items must be made lawfully, via legitimate means with actual currency. Any Virtual Items obtained illegally or fraudulently will result in suspension, freezing or termination of User account.**** Notwithstanding your purchase or possession of such Virtual Items, you do not in fact 'own' the Virtual Items, and the amount of any Virtual Item does not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, the Company grants you a limited licence to use the Service, including software programs that may manifest themselves as these items.

B. While using the Service and Virtual Items, you may send Gifts to other Users, which may result in revenue to such recipient User’s account (the “Transfer”). The Transfer is made solely at your discretion. Once a Transfer is made, it cannot be undone and the Virtual Item cannot be withdrawn or refunded. The Company does not guarantee that the amount or virtual value of the Virtual Items you may give a User will correlate to the revenue such User may receive when they cash out .

C. The purchase of Virtual Items in the Service is deemed completed upon the Company's confirmation of electronic payment from you via iTunes App Store or Google Play Store. Any virtual currency (non-convertible) balance shown in your User Account does not represent or reflect any currency value, but instead represents a measurement to the extent of your ability to use the Virtual Items within the Service. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual or real currency credited back to your User Account, nor will you be able to receive a refund of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items upon the suspension or termination of your account.

D. The value of Virtual Items within the Service is determined at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company has the right to adjust the purchase exchange rate between actual currency and Virtual Items (the “Exchange Rate”) at any time in any applicable region, and does not guarantee that the price of Virtual Items or the Exchange Rate be the same in different regions. By your use of the Service, you confirm your understanding of and agree to accept the then-current Exchange Rate of any Virtual Item at the time of your purchase.

E. By using the Service, you agree that your use of any purchased Virtual Items shall be solely for legitimate purposes within the Service, and that such use will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, platform policies and community guidelines at all times.

F. By using the Service and Virtual Items, you confirm your understanding that the Virtual Items are for sale products offered within the Service and should be purchased with actual currency. If you disagree with or do not fully understand our policy, do not purchase or use any Virtual Items in connection with the Service and do not engage in the Service in any way.

G. By your use of the Service and particularly Virtual Items, you confirm your understanding that we may change, modify or update these Terms, or the terms of sale in connection with the Virtual Items from time to time, and that such revised terms will apply to all subsequent purchases of any Virtual Items, and you agree that you have reviewed and agreed to these Terms and any terms regarding the sale of Virtual Items prior to making any purchase.

H. In the event your account balance is incorrect due to system maintenance or other technical failures as determined solely by us, we agree to make all necessary corrections and adjustments with respect to your account balance. If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions regarding purchases and/or payments regarding the Service, you may contact us at service.global@liveme.com.

I. User Inactivity. If your account remains inactive for six (6) consecutive months, all of your Virtual Items may be frozen. To unfreeze any such Virtual Items, you must email us at service.global@liveme.com and request that we unfreeze your account. Upon receipt of your request and review of your information, we will unfreeze your Virtual items within three (3) business days.

****9\. Virtual Diamonds – Cash-Out****

A. Once the Virtual Diamonds (a kind of Virtual Items) stored in your User Account exceeds certain amount, either by your own purchase or by receiving from other Users may be cashed out for actual currency (each transaction, a “Cash-Out”). The threshold value in Diamonds, and the value of currency received from any Cash-Out will be based on an exchange rate and in a currency form determined by us, based on the geographic location and application version that you are using the Service from, which we may set and change from time to time in our sole discretion. The Cash-Out exchange rate may also change due to the fluctuating value of the Coins, which may occur between the time they were purchased and the time you decide to execute the Cash-Out.

B. You must have an active payment receiving account in order to execute the Cash-Out. Your payment account will be linked to your User Account when you execute the Cash-Out and the payment will be processed within fifteen (15) business days following any Cash-Out request.

C. The amount of any Cash-Out cannot exceed the amount of residual Virtual Diamonds value in your User Account (as determined by the then-determined value of Virtual Items in your account). We have established minimum amounts required for each Cash-Out, as well as maximum amounts you may cash out per day. The amount required may vary based on different geographic locations.

D. We do not charge a withdrawal fee to Cash-Out activities. However, you are solely responsible for any fees that might occur in connection with this transaction, such as transactions fees charged by your banking system or due to applicable law or regulations enforced in the geographic location you reside. 

E. Each Cash-Out request will be manually approved by Company staff for security reasons, which may take up to fifteen (15) business days upon receiving the Cash-Out request. Cash-out requests involving suspicious account activities and/or information may be denied. Under some circumstances, the third-party transfer Service provider processing the Cash-Out request may place your Cash-Out funds received on a temporary hold based on minimal transfer amount requirement or no previous transaction history with Company to demonstrate a pattern of positive money exchanges. In the event such a hold occurs, please contact us for details at service.global@liveme.com. The company will not be responsible in any way for any financial holds initiated by your electronic transfer Service providers.

F. If your account has no activity or is deactivated for six (6) consecutive months, all of your unused or unredeemed Virtual Items will be reset to zero. For purpose of this section, the term “Inactive” means that, based on our records: (a) you have not logged into your LiveMe account; or (b) we have been unable to reach you to verify that you intend to continue use your account or to use or cash-out your Virtual Items. Virtual Items may be redeemed or removed from your account or be subject to other limitations at LiveMe’s sole discretion.

If you deactivate or cancel your LiveMe account pursuant to the LiveMe Terms of Service, your ability to redeem or use Virtual Items will be terminated immediately, without any right to refund or any other compensation for you. When we cancel or terminate access to your Virtual Items account balance for violating LiveMe Terms of Service or Community Policies, your right to use your Virtual Items account balance immediately ceases. Further, we may suspend or otherwise limit your access to your Virtual Items if we suspect, in our sole discretion, fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity associated with your account. When we suspend or limit access to your Virtual Items account balance, your right to use your Virtual Items account balance immediately ceases.

To restore any such Virtual Items due to account inactivity, you must email us at service.global@liveme.com and request that we restore the Virtual Items in your account. Upon receipt of your request and review of your information, we will determine whether we will restore any or all of your Virtual Items within three (3) business days.

****10\. Confiscation of Virtual Items Due to Termination or Fraud****

A. IMPORTANT: We take fraud extremely seriously. In addition to taking all applicable and necessary legal actions, we have the right to permanently confiscate any Virtual Items from any User Account that we determine were purchased or acquired using fraudulent measures; which includes but not limited to confiscation of any Gifts received by you from another User in which such Gifts were purchased fraudulently. In the event we determine that the Virtual Items in your possession were fraudulently purchased, we will notify you prior to confiscation and allow you an opportunity to make an appeal via the App.
