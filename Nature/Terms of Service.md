            1. Any notice of termination must be in in writing.

    9. #### Springer Nature’s Liability
        
        1. **For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies:**
            1. For Goods and Digital Products there is a legal guarantee of conformity. Claims arising from that guarantee become statute-barred within two years after the goods have been received or the Digital Product was provided, in the case of the continuous provision of a Digital Product not earlier than 12 months after the end of the provision of the Digital Product.
            2. Springer Nature’s liability shall not be limited in any event for any loss or damage which is (a) due to intent or gross negligence; (b) for loss of life, limb, or health. Strict liability under the German Product Liability Act shall not be limited.
            3. If an essential contractual obligation (i.e. an obligation the performance of which is necessary for due implementation of the contract, the performance of which a contractual partner generally may rely on, and the breach of which jeopardizes the attainment of the purpose of the contract) was breached due to slight negligence, Springer Nature’s liability shall be limited to that loss or damage the occurrence of which is typical with regard to the nature of the contract and was foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract.
            4. In all other cases, Springer Nature shall not be liable, for whatever cause in law.
        2. **For Customers having their habitual residence in North, Central or South America, the following applies:**
            
            Springer Nature warrants that it has the right to grant Customer the rights granted in these Terms and Conditions. Except for foregoing express warranty and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Springer Nature provides all Goods, Digital Content and Subscriptions (the “Content”) “as is” and makes no other representation or warranty. Springer Nature expressly disclaims any liability for any claim arising from or out of the Content, including but not limited to any errors, inaccuracies, omissions, or defects contained therein, and any implied or express warranty as to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Springer Nature shall not be liable for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, even if it has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Springer Nature’s liability for any and all claims under this agreement is limited to the agreed amounts actually paid by the customer at the time of the relevant purchase.
            
        3. Customer is obliged to make regular complete backups of data produced or stored by Customer at reasonable intervals that reflect the value of such data. Springer Nature shall not be liable for any loss of such data which could have been avoided by Customer’s compliance with said obligation.
    10. #### Application of the Terms and Conditions, amendments
        
        1. The contract on the use of the User Account and all contracts concluded in the Online Shop shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions as well as any other terms and conditions or other legal terms applicable to websites on which Customer has created the User Account. Should Customer have its own terms of business, such terms shall only apply where Springer Nature has expressly agreed to them in writing prior to conclusion of the relevant contract.
        2. Springer Nature may amend these Terms and Conditions if Springer Nature deems the amendment necessary to adapt these Terms and Conditions to changes in statutory law or case-law or to technical developments, or due to the introduction of new products or features of products. Springer Nature will notify the User/Customer of its intent to amend the Terms and Conditions and the envisaged date of the amended Terms and Conditions entering into force. If User/Customer does not object to the amendment within one month after receipt of said notification (the “Objection Period”), User/Customer shall be deemed to have agreed to the amended Terms and Conditions. In said notification, Springer Nature shall point out the legal relevance of the Objection Period.
        3. Should User/Customer object to the amendment, Springer Nature may give notice of termination of the relevant contract(s) at the time when the amended Terms and Conditions come into force; in such event Springer Nature shall without undue delay reimburse on a pro rata basis any advance payments of subscription fees.
    11. #### Severability
        
        Should any provision of these Terms and Conditions be or become ineffective or unenforceable, this shall not affect the remainder of these Terms and Conditions. In any such case, the parties shall negotiate in good faith for a clause which is to substitute the ineffective/unenforceable provision, reasonably balancing the parties’ interests.
        
    12. #### Governing law and venue
        
        1. **For Customers having their habitual residence in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania or Australia, the following applies:**
            
            Contracts between User/Customer and Springer Nature shall be governed and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with German law, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). If User/Customer is a natural person who concluded a contract for a purpose which can be regarded as being outside their trade or profession, this shall not have the result of depriving the User/Customer of the protection afforded to them by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement by virtue of the law of the country where the User/Consumer has their habitual residence.
            
            The parties agree that they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Heidelberg, Germany for all legal disputes arising directly or indirectly from the contractual relationship between Springer Nature and the User/Customer in the following circumstances:
            
            1. User/Customer is a registered trader according to the German Commercial Code, a public corporation or a special trust managing public assets;
            2. User’s/Customer’s place of residence or habitual place of abode is outside Germany or User/Customer relocated their place of residence or habitual place of abode outside Germany after the conclusion of the contract;
            3. User’s/Customer’s place of residence or habitual place of abode is not known at the time when legal action is filed.
            
        2. **For Customers having their habitual residence in North, Central or South America, the following applies:**
            
            Contracts between User/Customer and Springer Nature shall be governed and its provisions construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
            
            The parties agree that they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in New York, NY, USA.
            
    13. #### Out-of-court settlements/jury trial
        
        1. We do not engage in out-of-court settlements before consumer arbitration bodies. However, we are obliged to inform you that the European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution, which is available at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
        2. For Customers having their habitual residence in North America, Central America or South America, the following applies: User/Customer expressly waives the right to a trial by jury.
2. ### Special provisions for specific products
    
    1. #### Purchase of Goods

            3. Springer Nature may, in its discretion, add new content to a Personal Collection or replace existing content with revised editions, but Springer Nature shall not be obliged to make such updates.

The same applies if an Institutional Customer is found to have ordered a Personal Collection in breach of clause B.2.4.1.

Guided Open Access Terms and Conditions
---------------------------------------

**Date of version: 6th January 2021**

By submitting your manuscript (your “Article”) for consideration under Nature Portfolio’s Guided Open Access programme, you indicate that you have read and accept these terms and conditions (“the Terms”). If you do not accept all applicable Terms, please do not submit your Article for consideration by the Guided Open Access programme.

Please note that we may change these Terms from time to time without notice so you should review them each time that you plan to submit a manuscript for consideration through Guided Open Access.

In addition to these Terms, Nature Portfolio websites and platforms (“Sites”) that you visit in connection with Guided Open Access have terms and conditions which apply to the Site(s) on which they appear or the services available on the Sites ("Additional Terms"). Please ensure that you read any Additional Terms and the Privacy Policy as they form part of these Terms in respect of the Site(s) to which they relate. To the extent that the Additional Terms conflict with these Terms, these Terms shall prevail.

**We draw your attention to the limitations on liability contained in clause 6 below and to the consents to data transfer and processing contained in clause 5 below.**

1. [Guided Open Access](#guided-oa)
2. [Eligibility](#guided-oa-eligibility)
3. [Charges](#guided-oa-charges)
4. [Right of Withdrawal](#guided-oa-row)
5. [Your personal information](#guided-oa-personal-info)
6. [Our liability](#guided-oa-our-liability)
7. [Severance](#guided-oa-severance)
8. [Variation](#guided-oa-variation)
9. [Applicable law and jurisdiction](#guided-oa-applicable-law)

### 1\. **Guided Open Access**

Guided Open Access (“Guided OA”) is a programme that enables you to submit your Article to one Nature Research journal, and be considered simultaneously by two other associated journals in the Nature Portfolio. See our [Guided OA page](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/open-access/guided-open-access) for further details on the Guided OA programme.

#### a.Initial Submission

In order to participate in the Guided OA programme, you must select the Guided OA option when submitting your Article to a participating Nature Research Journal, and provide all information required pursuant to the submission process. If your Article is deemed appropriate for the Guided OA programme, it will be assigned to a handling editor from one of the participating journals, and you will be asked to arrange payment of an Editorial Assessment Charge (see Charges, below). If your Article is determined not to be suitable for any of the journals in the Guided OA programme, you will be notified and no Editorial Assessment Charge will be payable.

#### b.Editorial Assessment Report

Once your article has been assigned to a handling  editor and you have provided billing details for the Editorial Assessment Charge, your Article will be sent for peer review in accordance with our standard practices. On the basis of their expert judgement, and the feedback from one round of peer review, the Nature Portfolio editor responsible for your Article will prepare an Editorial Assessment Report (EAR). The EAR will typically provide an editorial evaluation of the manuscript, an open research evaluation, guidance for adhering to best reproducibility practice, and help to navigate and interpret the reviewers’ feedback, but contents of individual EARs may vary. If your Article is provisionally recommended for publication after the first round of peer review, the EAR will recommend which journal(s) will be suitable for publication of your Article. If you choose to continue with a recommended journal, the peer review process will continue in accordance with the journal’s standard practice. However, you are under no obligation to continue with a recommended journal, and may use the EAR in connection with preparation for submission of your Article to another journal. **YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN GUIDED OA (1) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR ARTICLE WILL BE PEER REVIEWED AT THE JOURNAL OF YOUR CHOICE, AND (2) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR ARTICLE IN ANY PARTICULAR PARTICIPATING JOURNAL, OR IN ANY OF THE PARTICIPATING JOURNALS.  SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE REVIEWED AND PUBLISHING DECISIONS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGH STANDARDS OF NATURE PORTFOLIO JOURNALS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF A MANUSCRIPT FOR PUBLICATION IN PARTICIPATING JOURNALS UNDER THE GUIDED OA PROGRAMME WILL BE NO GREATER THAN FOR MANUSCRIPTS SUBMITTED TO SUCH JOURNALS UNDER STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION OR OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING TERMS.**

####   c. Publication

Articles published through the Guided OA Programme will be published under a open access under a CC BY-NC-ND (Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International licence) or CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence) licence.

• CC BY-NC-ND: The article can be shared for non-commercial purposes as long as the authors are credited. Permission is needed for commercial re-use or sharing adapted and derivative versions.

• CC BY: The article may be shared and adapted for any purpose, including commercially, so long as the authors are credited. To learn more about OA licences visit our [licensing and copyright guide](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/policies/journal-policies/licensing-and-copyright).

### 2\. **Eligibility**

If you are affiliated with an institution participating in a Fully OA agreement or Transformative (or Compact) agreement that includes Nature Portfolio journals, you will not be eligible for Guided Open Access, where fees are applied before acceptance (Editorial Assessment Charge). Direct Open Access is available to you by selecting the open access option once your paper has been accepted, with your fees covered by the relevant institutional agreement. Please check our  [OA agreement pages](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/institutional-agreements) for further information about what fees are covered.

### 3\. **Charges**

Once your Article has entered the Guided Open Access process, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Editorial Assessment Charge (EAC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the EAC. **THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT CHARGE WILL NOT BE REFUNDED EVEN IF YOUR ARTICLE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN ONE OF THE GUIDED OA JOURNALS PURSUANT TO THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT OR IS OTHERWISE NOT PUBLISHED IN A GUIDED OA JOURNAL FOR ANY REASON.**

If your article is accepted for publication after completion of the peer review process at a recommended journal, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Top-Up Article Processing Charge (APC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the Top-Up APC.

If your Article is published in a Nature Research journal (Nature Physics, Nature Methods or Nature Genetics), the combined amount of the EAC and the Top-Up APC will be lower than the cost of publishing on an open access basis directly through those journals, outside of Guided OA. **IF YOUR ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS OR ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS JOURNALS, THE COMBINED AMOUNT OF THE EAC AND THE TOP-UP APC WILL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE COST OF PUBLISHING ON AN OPEN ACCESS BASIS DIRECTLY WITH ANY OF SUCH JOURNALS, OUTSIDE OF GUIDED OA.** Please see the Nature Research [Guided Open Access page](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/open-access/guided-open-access) for exact costs. 

### 4\. **Right of Withdrawal**

You have the right to withdraw from your agreement to pay the EAC or Top-Up APC within 14 days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (for customers domiciled or established in North, Central or South America: Springer Nature Customer Service Center LLC, 200 Hudson Street, Suite 503, Jersey City, NJ 07311, USA, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email: [ORSupport@springernature.com](mailto:ORSupport@springernature.com); for customers domiciled or established in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Australia: Springer Nature Customer Service Center GmbH, Europaplatz 3, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email: [ORSupport@springernature.com](mailto:ORSupport@springernature.com)) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail).

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

#### Effects of withdrawal

If you withdraw from the contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

The following form may be used to state your withdrawal, but it is not obligatory:

### 7\. **Severance**

If any court or competent authority finds that any provision of these Terms (or part of any provision) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision or part-provision shall, to the extent required, be deemed to be deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of these Terms shall not be affected.
