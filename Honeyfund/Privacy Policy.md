We collect personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, postal address, zip code and other contact details (“Personal Information”). As noted in the following sections, we will also collect additional information based upon a particular interaction with our Site, including registration or in providing a gift to a registered couple or purchasing an eGiftCard. We also collect information about your use of the website including technical information, such as the date and time you access the Site, your internet protocol address, browser name, computing device type, and service usage information such as records and history about transactions and preferences you have made on our Site, and demographic, geographic and psychographic information (collectively, “Browsing Information”).

  

### Information collected at registration

Honeyfund.com, Inc. collects Personal Information when you register with us and when you use Honeyfund services. Honeyfund.com, Inc. will combine this information about you with information we obtain from third party business partners. Our third party business partners include (1) retailers that enable you to choose to use our services in connection with your wedding registry and/or shopping with such retailers; (2) social media networks that permit you to interface your social media account with our Site; and (3) third party advertising companies who sell advertisements on our Site, (4) payment providers who process your payments for gifts or gift cards purchased on our site. During registration, we require members to provide us with Personal Information, and additional information, such as your future spouse's first and last name, your wedding date, preferred honeymoon destination, and demographic information, including your ZIP or postal code. The information we collect regarding your spouse has the chance of revealing your sexual orientation. We do not record any member's sexual orientation, but due to the legally recognized nature of this information, we will collect your explicit consent to process this piece of information only as necessary to render our services through the site to you.

In addition to the questions you answer when you register for Honeyfund.com membership, we collect information necessary to create your honeymoon registry, including but not limited to at least one registry item the couple would like to receive as a gift and a contact person for the account.

Registration information provided to us through the Site is collected via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol (https). Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.

Users who register for our Site through Facebook will be prompted through Facebook's website or application permissions interface to agree to share their public Facebook profile, friend list and e-mail address with us. Facebook is a joint data controller and has collected the information from your public Facebook profile, friend list and email address to provide to us with your affirmative consent. Facebook is responsible for that data, which is provided to Honeyfund.com, Inc.

  

### Information collected from the Give a Gift process

However, some information is collected during the "Give a Gift" or Checkout process, including Personal Information, such as first and last name, e-mail address and/or phone number. This Personal Information may be linked with the member's account for whom the gift is being provided.

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of 18. Honeyfund services are available only to persons who are 18 years of age and over. If we learn that a user is under the age of 18, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information.

#### 2\. How We Use the Information We Collect From you

The Personal and Browsing Information we collect from your membership helps us to create your online account and make your registry available to your guests, improve our content, customize certain pages for you, make third-party payment systems available to you, and with your affirmative consent, provide you with promotional information and updates about Honeyfund.com, Inc. and its affiliates.

The name and e-mail address collected during the “Give a Gift” or eGift Card purchase process is not shared with third parties, but it is used by Honeyfund.com, Inc. and Site members to communicate with the gift giver regarding their gift and to announce future features, product updates and offers.

We use your Browsing Information to identify the geographic locations where our visitors originate, to examine overall Site traffic trends, for system administration, troubleshooting, security and fraud prevention, and to improve and optimize your user experience on the website. We record this information in aggregate form and link to accounts and Personal Information to prevent spam e-mail activities using Honeyfund.com, Inc.'s email feature. We also use Browsing Information to customize portions of our Site to your preferences. For example, Honeyfund.com, Inc. uses a cookie to identify you as a Honeyfund.com member and to provide you with access to your personal account. This way, you don't have to login every time you come to the Honeyfund.com website. If you do not allow your browser to accept cookies, please understand that some of the areas or functionality within our site will be limited.

Unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.

  

#### 3\. How We Share Your Information

Our email delivery providers receive your email address and user ID. Our advertising business partners receive your Browsing Information, including internet protocol address, web history, and other demographic and internet usage information. We will also provide information necessary to our third party payment card processors to prevent fraud or other harm occurring through our Site.

In the event that Honeyfund.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are sold or Honeyfund.com, Inc. is reorganized or merged into another organization, your Personal Information and Browsing Information will be among Honeyfund.com, Inc. transferred assets.

There may be rare instances in which we are required to disclose your Personal Information, Browsing Information, or both as required by law and as necessary to comply with a judicial or administrative proceeding, court order or legal process services on us.
