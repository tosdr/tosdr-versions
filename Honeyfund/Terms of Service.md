Terms of Use
============

Last Updated November 6, 2023 

Honeyfund’s mission is to make the honeymoon happen for all couples! We do this by providing honeyfund.com site users with support, community, tools and information to succeed in planning an authentic wedding, funding a fantastic honeymoon and building a successful marriage.

The Honeyfund websites and app exist for the purpose of providing a personal website and gift registry to users. Any use outside of this purpose is prohibited.

These terms of use apply exclusively to your access and use of Honeyfund.com, and any parts or sections thereof including, but not limited to, web content, member-personalized website or registry information, member profile information, photos, and graphics (herein after referred to collectively as “Site”).

If you do not agree with any of these terms, do not access or otherwise use the Site or any information or materials contained on the Site. Your use of the Site shall be deemed to be your agreement to abide by each of the terms set forth below.

Honeyfund.com strives to maintain the Site in good working order, however, you understand and agree that the Site is provided "AS-IS" and from time to time and for reasons out of Honeyfund.com, Inc.’s control, the Site may not be available. Therefore Honeyfund.com, Inc. does not assume responsibility for your ability to (or any costs or fees associated with your ability to) obtain access to the Site. Nor does Honeyfund.com, Inc. assume any liability for the failure to store or maintain any user communications or personal settings. 

1\. Privacy Policy. Information and data provided by you are subject to our Privacy Policy. This policy, as updated from time to time, may be found at [https://www.honeyfund.com/Privacy](https://www.honeyfund.com/Privacy).

2\. Payment Services. Honeyfund.com, Inc. provides multiple payment services for users to choose from, including links and interfaces to third-party payment services, such as [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) and [Braintree](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/home) which permit gift givers to send funds to users (or user’s representative) registered with Honeyfund.com, Inc. You acknowledge that Honeyfund.com, Inc. does not control and is not responsible for payments made or received through these third-party services. Any use of third-party payment services by you will be subject to the fees, terms and conditions of such third-party payment services, and at your own risk. Please consult the terms for your chosen payment service provider at [PayPal Terms](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full), [Stripe Terms](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal) [Braintree Terms](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/home). In cases where the third-party payment service chosen by you is not available due to incomplete account setup, internet or service outages or any other reason, you acknowledge that Honeyfund.com, Inc. may collect payment on your behalf in order to facilitate a successful gift transaction for your Honeyfund page visitors.

For users of Honeyfund in the US and certain other countries, Honeyfund offers a bank account payments solution powered by Stripe, a third-party payment processor. In order for you to use these payment processing services on Honeyfund, you will be registered with Stripe as a merchant and therefore agree to their terms of service. You also agree to be charged and pay the fee for this service as published on Honeyfund.com and in your Honeyfund account, which is subject to change at any time. You further agree that funds processed to your Stripe merchant account that go unclaimed for a period of 120 days will be moved into your Honeyfund account, stored in the Honeyfund Wallet gift card balance and locked for your security. (See below for more information about the Honeyfund Wallet and how to claim funds.)

By accepting this agreement with [Honeyfund — The Free Honeymoon Registry](http://honeyfund.com/) , Inc., you agree that you have reviewed the Stripe Terms of Service. If you have questions regarding the Stripe Terms of Service, please contact Stripe at [Contact Us | Stripe](https://stripe.com/contact) .

Honeyfund.com, Inc. collects payments via its merchant processors (such as Stripe) in order to add funds to your Honeyfund Wallet – a digital gift card balance inside your Honeyfund account that can be redeemed in a variety of ways including but not limited to nearly 200 digital gift card brands.  Further, unclaimed funds processed via the member’s own Stripe merchant accounts that go unclaimed for a period of 120 days are converted to the Honeyfund Wallet gift card balance. See [Honeyfund Gift Card Terms of Use](https://www.honeyfund.com/gift-card-terms) for more information about the Honeyfund Wallet gift card balance and how to claim the funds. A full list of Honeyfund digital gift card partners can be found [here](https://www.honeyfund.com/products/).

Further, Honeyfund.com, Inc. may collect payment on your behalf in order to facilitate a successful gift transaction for your Honeyfund page visitors. In these cases, the funds will be available in your Honeyfund Wallet gift card balance in your Honeyfund account where they can be redeemed for digital gift cards provided by Honeyfund partners, or in your PayPal account in the case of a PayPal outage. 

In some circumstances and in order to reduce transaction fees, [Honeyfund.com](http://honeyfund.com/) may collect and pay PayPal fees on behalf of the user. You acknowledge these fees will automatically be paid to Honeyfund.com from your PayPal account.

PURCHASES

Honeyfund strives to maintain a safe and secure gifting service. However for reasons out of Honeyfund’s control, when payment is sent directly to the registered user or user’s representative via a third-party payment service such as Stripe, Venmo or PayPal, Honeyfund.com, Inc. cannot be responsible for lost payments, identity theft, fraud or refunds.

In some cases when you purchase a gift via the Site for a registered party, you are purchasing "Honeyfund Wallet" funds in the amount of your gift. The gift recipient uses the Honeyfund Wallet funds to purchase the item you selected at the date of their choosing. The registered wedding party may elect to retain your gift as Honeyfund Wallet funds in the amount you paid. They may use the Honeyfund Wallet funds to purchase other items at Honeyfund. Unredeemed Honeyfund Wallet funds may be escheated in accordance with applicable state law.

Honeyfund Wallet funds never expire and can be used for any digital gift card that Honeyfund sells. Honeyfund Wallet funds cannot be redeemed or used for cash, or be applied toward items purchased from another website, unless specifically allowed and covered under a third-party arrangement with Honeyfund’s government-regulated vendors such as PayPal/Venmo and Stripe. In addition, Honeyfund Wallet funds cannot be retroactively applied to past orders. From time to time Honeyfund may make available limited-time offers for marketing, goodwill, referrals or other promotional purposes. These offers expire on the dates disclosed at the time the offer is issued.
