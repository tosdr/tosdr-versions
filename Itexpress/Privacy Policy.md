​

ITExpress respects the privacy of our clients in our mobile applications, our website [https://uni-accounting.com](https://uni-accounting.com/) and our Business Software. Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection provisions of the federal government (Data Protection Act, DSG), everyone has the right to the protection of their privacy and protection against misuse of their personal data. We adhere to these regulations.

In close cooperation with our hosting providers, we strive to protect the databases as well as possible against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or falsification.

The data is not transmitted to us or passed on to third parties. To delete the financial data in the local database, uninstall the mobile app. For the Business Software, the local database and backups can be deleted.

Some of our mobile apps have the possibility to access personal photos, and use calendars to set dates in the app.
