Terms & Conditions
==================

ESSENTIAL BRANDS, INC. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Please read the following Terms and Conditions (the “**Terms**”) carefully before using any website of Essential Brands, Inc.  or its affiliates, successors, or assigns (“**Kiddie Academy**”, “**our**” or “**we**”), as well as any online features, services and/or programs offered by Kiddie Academy (collectively, the “**Website**”).

Kiddie Academy is the franchisor for a franchise system relating to the establishment and operation of child care and early childhood educational centers throughout the United States (each an “**Academy**”). Under the terms of Kiddie Academy’s franchise agreement, Kiddie Academy provides certain authorizations, licenses and other rights to third party franchisees (each an “**Authorized Franchisee**”). Authorized Franchisees own and operate their own Academy(ies) under the quality assurance and other guidelines established by Kiddie Academy, but each Academy is otherwise independent of Kiddie Academy’s control. Kiddie Academy is not responsible for the conduct of its Authorized Franchisees, including any Internet sites that they may operate (whether or not linked to a Website, as defined below) and their collection and use of personal information. However, as a convenience to our Authorized Franchisees, we host the web pages maintained by Authorized Franchisees on the Website. These Terms also apply to all web pages maintained by Authorized Franchisees on the Website.

These Terms do not apply to web pages operated and/or owned by an entity other than Kiddie Academy. Users of web pages operated and/or owned by entities other than Kiddie Academy should refer to the Terms and Conditions in effect for the applicable web page owner.

By accessing or using the Website, you acknowledge the information set forth above and agree to the following Terms. If you do not agree to any portion of these Terms, you should not access or otherwise use the Website. The Website is not intended for, or designed to be used by or attract, children under the age of sixteen (16).

CONVENIENCE AND INFORMATION ONLY
--------------------------------

The Website is provided to you as a convenience and for your information only. By merely providing access to the Website, neither Kiddie Academy nor any Authorized Franchisee warrants or represents that: (a) any materials, documents, images, graphics, logos, design, audio, video and any other information provided from or on the Website (collectively, the “**Content**”) is accurate or complete; (b) the Content is up-to-date or current; (c) Kiddie Academy or any Authorized Franchisee has any obligation to update any Content; (d) the Content is free from technical inaccuracies or programming or typographical errors; (e) the Content is free from changes caused by a third party; (f) your access to the Website will be free from interruptions, errors, computer viruses or other harmful components; and/or (g) any information obtained by you in response to questions asked through the Website is accurate or complete.

SITE USE AND CONTENT
--------------------

You may view, copy or print pages from the Website solely for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not otherwise use, modify, copy, print, display, reproduce, distribute or publish any information from the Website without the express, prior, written consent of Kiddie Academy. We may make changes to the Website and/or to the services described in these Terms at any time and without further notice to you.

I. DISCLAIMERS
--------------

(a) **NO WARRANTIES**. You expressly agree that your use of the website is at your sole risk. The website and the content are provided “as is” and “as available” for your use, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, unless such warranties are legally incapable of exclusion. Neither Kiddie Academy nor any authorized franchisee make any representations or warranties that the website, the content or any services offered in connection with the website are or will remain uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected or that the web pages on the website, or the servers used in connection with the website, are or will remain free from any viruses, worms, time bombs, drop dead devices, trojan horses or other harmful components. Neither Kiddie Academy nor any Authorized Franchisee guarantees that you will be able to access or use the website at times or locations of your choosing, or that Kiddie Academy will have adequate capacity for the website as a whole or in any specific geographic area. The entire liability of Kiddie Academy and any Authorized Franchisee, and your exclusive remedy with respect to the use of any service or product provided on or through the website, will be the refund of the purchase price for any products or services found to be inadequate.

(b) **INDEMNIFICATION**. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Kiddie Academy and Authorized Franchisees, and their respective owners, directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, liabilities, judgments, losses, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) assessed or incurred by Kiddie Academy or any Authorized Franchisee, directly or indirectly, with respect to or arising out of: (i) your failure to comply with or your breach of these Terms; and/or (ii) your use of the rights granted hereunder, including without limitation any claims made by any third parties.

(c) **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**. In no event will Kiddie Academy or any Authorized Franchisee be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages arising from your use of the website and/or any products or services provided in connection with the website or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the website and/or any products or services provided in connection with the website. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions the liability of Kiddie Academy and Authorized Franchisees will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

(d) **NO GUARANTEE OF ADMISSION**. The availability of the Website does not constitute an offer for placement at an Academy or a guarantee of availability of services by any Authorized Franchisee.
