Preamble
--------

Premiumize.me enables the user to use our servers to perform the very same tasks that would normally be executed locally on his computer.

Since the downloading, accessing files and media is handled remotely on our servers (“in the cloud”), the user will greatly benefit from the servers connectivity to the Internet.

The user further benefits through our aggregated premium connections to many different websites and datacenters. This results in higher speed, reduced wait times and increased convenience.

Terms of Service
----------------

### Introduction

The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Premiumize.me website and all content, services and products available at or through the website (collectively, the Website", "Site" or "Service"). The Website is owned and operated by Phonalyse SPRL (the "Company"), doing business as Premiumize.me ("Premiumize.me", “we”, “us”, or “our”). The Website is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Website (collectively, the “Agreement”).

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or using any part of the Website, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access the Website or use the Service. The Website is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old.

You should periodically review the most up-to-date version (https://www.premiumize.me/legal). We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Service, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Premiumize.me may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms of Service and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.

### Intellectual Property Rights

Unless otherwise stated, the Website and Service is our property. This includes all source code, databases, functionality, software, designs and graphics (collectively, the "Content"), and the trademarks, service marks and logos (the "Marks") contained therein. Unless otherwise indicated the Content, as well as our Marks, are owned or controlled by or licensed to us and are protected by copyright and trademark laws, as well as various other intellectual property and unfair competition laws, international copyright laws, and international conventions. The Content and the Marks are provided on the Site "as is" solely for your information and personal use. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Service, no portion of the Site and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, summarized, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose of any kind without our express prior written permission.

An exception is made for resellers officially licensed by us, who may use logos of the Marks, as well as excerpts of the Content, for their distribution.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Site, the Content and the Marks.

### License and Access

Provided that you comply with these Terms of Service and pay the applicable fees, Premiumize.me grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and make personal and non-commercial use of the Service. Unless explicitly agreed in a written form, this license does not include resale or commercial use of the Service or its content.

All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms of Service are reserved by Premiumize.me and shall remain with us.

You may not misuse the Service. You may use the Service only as permitted by law. The licenses granted by Premiumize.me to use the Service shall expire if you violate these Terms of Service.

### User Obligations

By using the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, login credentials (including, but not limited to, passwords and API Key), and restricting access to your computer and mobile devices, and agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password to the extent permitted by applicable law. You should take all necessary steps to ensure that the password and API Key is kept confidential and secure, and you should notify us immediately if you have reason to believe that your password or API Key has become known to another person or if the password or API Key is or may be used in an unauthorized manner. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide to us is accurate and complete, and for notifying us of any changes to the information you provide.

An e-mail address is required for registration on the Website. When registering via external services such as Google, the e-mail address stored there is used for registration. The use of so-called "trash mails", "disposable mails" or "fake mails" is not permitted. This includes all providers of e-mail services that do not permanently and exclusively assign an e-mail address and the associated mailbox to a single person.

Premiumize.me reserves the right to exclude certain e-mail providers or their domains. Accordingly, registration with such an e-mail address is not possible. Existing registered users are not affected by this.

The use of the cloud storage is subject to a storage limit. It is the responsibility of the user to comply with this. If this storage limit is exceeded, Premiumize.me reserves the right to arbitrarily delete files from the cloud storage until the storage limit is complied with again.

### Purchases, Payment and Products

All products are subject to availability. We reserve the right to discontinue any products at any time for any reason. Prices for all products are subject to change.

Premiumize.me accepts all major credit cards, cryptocurrencies and other payment methods.

You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made through the Site, if required to be provided during the payment process. You also agree to promptly update your account and payment information, including e-mail address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we may complete your transactions and contact you as needed. Sales tax or VAT will be added to the price of purchases as we deem necessary. We may change prices at any time. All prices on our website are quoted in Euros, however payment may be made in another currency. Only the payment amount displayed when completing the payment with our payment service providers or their partners are explicitly valid. Premiumize.me is not responsible for any discrepancies between the actual prices paid and the prices displayed on the website, if such discrepancies are due for example, but not limited to, taxes, foreign transaction fees, fees for payments in other currencies or exchange rates.

You agree to pay all charges at the prices then in effect for your purchases, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider for any such amounts upon placing your order. If your order is subject to recurring charges, then you consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until such time as you cancel the applicable order/contract. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if we have already requested or received the payment.

We reserve the right to refuse any order placed through the Site or to prevent any order from being placed in advance (e.g. by blocking payment options or products). We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These limits may also apply to orders placed from the same customer account or under the same payment method, and/or to orders using the same billing or shipping address. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole discretion, appear to have been placed by dealers, unlicensed resellers or distributors. There are no claims to purchase a product, even if it may be available for purchase by other users.

Should Premiumize.me receive a chargeback or dispute relating to a payment you have made, or should your payment be identified as fraudulent or otherwise unlawful, irregular or contrary to this Terms of Service, the Service and the related license will be suspended and you will be liable to repay the relevant amount plus any fees incurred. We also reserves the right to revoke any and all Services until such time as any disputed amounts plus any fees and charges incurred (including for the avoidance of doubt, any relevant payment processing fees) have been repaid. This claim can also be handed over to a collection agency by Premiumize.me or our payment processing partners.

If a contract cannot be extended due to payment problems (e.g., but not limited to, outdated payment data or rejected payments by payment service providers), the user will be informed of this by the payment service provider. Premiumize.me grants a grace period of 72 hours, during which the problem can be solved. A legal claim to this grace period does not exist. After this period, the contract may be terminated by Premiumize.me without notice in accordance with this Agreement and access to the Services may be blocked.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, a month is defined as 30 days. This also applies to premium packages with multi-month terms (e.g., but not limited to, 3-month and 12-month packages) and other specifications in months (e.g., but not limited to, expiration dates for voucher codes and booster packages). Premiumize.me reserves the right to make exceptions from this clause unilaterally and without informing the customer. However, in no case less term days may be credited. Term days credited in addition to the purchased package are mandatory free of charge. A legal claim does not exist.

Voucher codes from licensed resellers are valid for 12 months after creation by the reseller, unless otherwise stated by Premiumize.me. Coupons which are provided free of charge (e.g. for promotions or trials) are valid for at least one day after creation, unless otherwise stated by Premiumize.me.

Booster packages are valid for 12 months (360 days) after purchase. Any unused booster points expire after this time without replacement.

### Refunds and Contract Termination

All sales are final and no refund will be issued regardless of usage. This means that the contract can only be terminated at the end of the contract term.

Premiumize.me reserves the right to make exceptions to this rule at its sole discretion, especially in cases of fraud, typing errors, etc.

All overcharges or billing disputes must be reported within 60 days of the time the dispute occurred.

For user accounts that have been blocked due to a violation of these Terms of Service, no refund is possible.

Premiumize.me allows the termination of a contract at any time by the end of the contract period. The termination is possible through the account area at any time. The cancellation period is 24 hours before contract renewal. Cancellations received by Premiumize.me via alternative channels, such as but not limited to telephone, telefax, mail, e-mail, social media or contact form, must be demonstrably delivered to Premiumize.me at least 14 days prior to contract renewal.

In the event of contract termination or after automatic contract end, access to the service is no longer possible and all data in the cloud storage will be irretrievably deleted.
