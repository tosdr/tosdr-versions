What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, such as helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.

Our Website may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them). We use two broad categories of cookies:

1. **First party cookies** – served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognise your computer or mobile device when it revisits Our Website; and
2. **Third party cookies**, which are served by service providers or business partners on Our Website, and can be used by these parties to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising and social media features.

You can set your cookie preferences using your browser. Many browsers provide information regarding cookies through their “Help” menu, and additional information may be found online, e.g. at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

They collect information such as the number of visitors within various age ranges, the gender of visitors (only where you have personally entered this information into your Think Academy profile) and other analytic categories. Again, this data is aggregated so you cannot be identified personally, i.e. we are provided with a percentage of visitors who fall into various categories. |
