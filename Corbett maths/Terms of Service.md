Terms and Conditions
====================

Terms of Use
------------

All the resources on Corbettmaths, videos, worksheets, 5-a-day and everything else, have been created, over 1000’s of hours, by Corbettmaths. The resources are free (**and will always be free**) to use for individual use or for use by teachers for their classes.

I only ask that you keep in consideration the amount of work that I have put into the website and content, and **if in doubt over your planned use of the resources, please feel free to ask me directly** (there is a Contact button on the right hand side).

I encourage colleagues to “link” to my resources on their school websites, VLEs or personal website rather that uploading copies of my files. The main reason for this is that I constantly update and improve my worksheets and this avoids older versions of my files being found online.

Under no circumstances can any Corbettmaths resource be used by anyone for profit making purposes.

Under no circumstances can any Corbettmaths resource (including individual questions) be used within other resources that are redistributed. An example being, copying Corbettmaths questions and then uploading on any teaching resources websites.

Please **never** pass any of my work off as your own (including individual questions) as all work is copyrighted. Make sure it is very clear that it is if a resource is being linked to, that Corbettmaths is the owner of the resource and its use is subject to our Terms of Use.
