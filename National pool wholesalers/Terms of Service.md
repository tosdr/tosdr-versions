Liner Purchase Issue!

This liner size is only allowed to be purchased at the present time with a swimming pool due to lack of inventory available nationally.  
  
Once more product arrives in August, we may be able to sell them as stand-alone liners again.  
  
In order to sell a pool, it needs a liner, so we must retain a certain number of liners to sell with the pools we have in our warehouse.
