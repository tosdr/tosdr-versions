Please read the below information as you need to understand your rights as a consumer and what you need to do at delivery. READ THE PAPERS YOU ARE SIGNING. It clearly states your rights and what you are signing. Be sure to note ANY exceptions on the BILL OF LADING prior to signing.  
  
If you receive missing or damaged merchandise, you need to notify the carrier upon receiving the order. Note on the freight bill the problem you encountered.

We are only responsible for goods if we have a signed copy of the BOL from you indicating the goods are damaged, with a detailed description of the problem. You have 48 hours to check the goods and file your own concealed damage claim. Companies do not always pay on concealed damage so you should fully check the entire order upon delivery.

Liner Purchase Issue!

This liner size is only allowed to be purchased at the present time with a swimming pool due to lack of inventory available nationally.  
  
Once more product arrives in August, we may be able to sell them as stand-alone liners again.  
  
In order to sell a pool, it needs a liner, so we must retain a certain number of liners to sell with the pools we have in our warehouse.
