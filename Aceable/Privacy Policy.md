Privacy Policy
==============

**Last Updated:** _September 20__, 2024_

This Privacy Notice describes how Aceable, Inc and its various brands, including Aceable(“**we**”, “**us**,” “**our**”) collects, uses and discloses information about individuals who use any of our websites (including [https://www.aceable.com/](https://www.aceable.com/)), applications, services, tools and features, or otherwise interact with us (collectively, the “**Services**”). For the purposes of this Privacy Notice, “**you**” and “**your**” means you as the user of the Services, whether you are a customer, website visitor, job applicant, representative of a company with whom we do business, or another individual whose information we have collected pursuant to this Privacy Notice. Please note that the Services are designed for users in the United States only and are not intended for users located outside the United States.

Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. By using any of the Services, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Notice. If you do not agree to this Privacy Notice, please do not use or access the Services.

  

**1\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE**

We may modify this Privacy Notice from time to time, in which case we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to the way in which we use or disclose information we collect, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (such as by emailing you at the last email address you provided us, by posting notice of such changes on the Services, or by other means consistent with applicable law) and will take additional steps as required by applicable law. If you do not agree to any updates to this Privacy Notice, please do not continue using or accessing the Services.

  

**2\. COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

When you use or access the Services, we collect certain categories of information about you from a variety of sources.

_Information You Provide to Us_

Some features of the Services may require you to directly provide us with certain information about yourself. You may elect not to provide this information, but doing so may prevent you from using or accessing these features. Information that you directly submit through our Services includes:

  

* **Basic contact details**, such as name, address, phone number, and email. We use this information to create and maintain your account and provide the Services, and to communicate with you (including to tell you about products or services that may be of interest to you).
    
* **Account information**, such as username, password, and security questions that you select and the answers you provide. We use this information to provide the Services and to maintain and secure your account with us. If you choose to register an account, you are responsible for keeping your account credentials safe. We recommend you do not share your access details with anyone else. If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us immediately.
    
* **Payment information**, such as bank account, credit or debit card information, and billing address, which we collect using a third party payment processor and do not store or otherwise process ourselves. This information is used to process your payment and provide the Services.
    
* **Information required by licensing authorities,** such as the last 4 or 5 digits of your social security number, your driver’s license number, state ID card or other identifiers, racial and ethnic origin and gender. We use this information to provide licensing authorities with the information needed to grant you your license after completion of your course.
    
* **Applicant details**, such as information included in your resume or CV, references, and job history. We use applicant details to process your application for employment and to evaluate your candidacy.
    
* **Information provided when you choose to take a virtual exam,** such as photographs and voice recordings, which is collected by a third-party exam proctor and which we do not store or otherwise process. Our third-party exam offeror uses this to verify your identity and otherwise provide exam-proctoring services.
    
* **Any other information you choose to include in communications with us**, for example, when sending a message through the Services or interacting with our artificial intelligence-powered chat bots. We use this information to communicate with you.
    

_Information We Collect Automatically_

We also automatically collect certain information about your interaction with the Services (“**Usage Data**”). To do this, we may use cookies or other tracking technologies (“**Tracking Technologies**”). Usage Data includes:

  

* **Device information**, such as device type, operating system, unique device identifier, and internet protocol (IP) address.
    
* **Location information**, such as approximate location.
    
* **Other information regarding your interaction with the Services**, such as browser type, log data, date and time stamps, clickstream data, keyboard strokes, interactions with marketing emails, and ad impressions.
    

We use Usage Data to tailor features and content to you, market more effectively to you, provide you with targeted offers or promotions, run analytics and better understand user interaction with the Services. For more information on how we use Tracking Technologies and your choices, see the section below, _Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_.

_Information Collected From Other Sources_

We may obtain information about you from outside sources, including information that we collect directly from third parties and information from third parties that you choose to share with us. Such information includes:

* **Analytics data** we receive from analytics providers such as Google Analytics, TikTok Pixel and Meta Pixel.
    
* **Information we receive from career websites**, which we use to process your application for employment.
    
* **Information we receive from certain business partners regarding individuals who have completed courses**, which we use to create and deliver course completion certificates.
    
* **Information we receive from third-party coupon providers**. This information, which includes name, email, phone, voucher code, product and price, is used to verify your purchase and provide our Services to you.
    
* **Information we receive when you choose to link any social media platforms to your account or otherwise engage with us or others through our social media platforms**, such as Facebook or X, which we use to maintain your account and login information and engage with you.
    

Any information we receive from outside sources will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided to us by third parties and are not responsible for any third party’s policies or practices. For more information, see the section below, _Third Party Websites and Links_.

In addition to the specific uses described above, we may use any of the above information to provide you with the Services and to maintain our business relationship, including by enhancing the safety and security of our Services (e.g., troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, system maintenance, and reporting), providing customer support, sending service and other non-marketing communications, monitoring and analyzing trends, conducting internal research and development, complying with applicable legal obligations, enforcing any applicable terms of service, and protecting the Services, our rights, and the rights of our employees, users or other individuals.

Finally, we may deidentify or anonymize your information such that it cannot reasonably be used to infer information about you or otherwise be linked to you (“**deidentified information**”) (or we may collect information that has already been deidentified/anonymized), and we may use such deidentified information for any purpose. To the extent we possess or process any deidentified information, we will maintain and use such information in deidentified/anonymized form and not attempt to re-identify the information, except solely for the purpose of determining whether our deidentification/anonymization process satisfies legal requirements.

  

**3\. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you may be able to control the way in which your devices permit the use of Tracking Technologies. If you so choose, you may block or delete our cookies from your browser; however, blocking or deleting cookies may cause some of the Services, including certain features and general functionality, to work incorrectly. If you have questions regarding the specific information about you that we process or retain, as well as your choices regarding our collection and use practices, please contact us using the information listed below.

Your browser settings may allow you to transmit a “do not track” signal, “opt-out preference” signal, or other mechanism for exercising your choice regarding the collection of your information when you visit various websites.

**5\. SOCIAL FEATURES**

Certain features of the Services allow you to initiate interactions between the Services and third-party services or platforms, such as social networks (“**Social Features**”). Social Features include features that allow you to access our pages on third-party platforms, and from there “like” or “share” our content. Use of Social Features may allow a third party to collect and/or use your information. If you use Social Features, information you post or make accessible may be publicly displayed by the third-party service. Both we and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of both the Services and the third-party service.

**6\. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND LINKS**

We may provide links to third-party websites or platforms. If you follow links to sites or platforms that we do not control and are not affiliated with us, you should review the applicable privacy notice, policies and other terms. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of, or information found on, these sites or platforms. Information you provide on public or semi-public venues, such as third-party social networking platforms, may also be viewable by other users of the Services and/or users of those third-party platforms without limitation as to its use. Our inclusion of such links does not, by itself, imply any endorsement of the content on such platforms or of their owners or operators.

  

**7\. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Services, and we do not seek or knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected information about a child under 13 years of age, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided us with their personal information, you may contact us using the below information to request that it be deleted.

  

**8\. **DATA SECURITY AND RETENTION  
****

Despite our reasonable efforts to protect your information, no security measures are impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee “perfect security.” Any information you send to us electronically, while using the Services or otherwise interacting with us, may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to send us sensitive or confidential information.

We retain your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes specified in this Privacy Notice. When determining the length of time to retain your information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to provide you the Services, satisfy a state regulatory requirement, resolve a dispute, or enforce our contractual agreements.

Participation in these promotions is voluntary, and no purchase is required. While we cannot calculate the precise value of your information, our promotional programs generally reflect the value of the relationships that we have with the individuals who participate in them. You may opt out from our email communications at any time.

You may have a right to request that we confirm whether we process information about you and give you access to that information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another business without impediment.
