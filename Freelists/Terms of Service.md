Terms of Service
----------------

**Updated May, 2018**

This page describes FreeLists, a Service of Avenir Technologies, LLC., including "FreeLists", "us," "we," and "our." We describe what the Service is, how it's used, how the service is terminated, and what is expected of you as a user of the Service. **By using the Service you agree to these Terms.**

### What FreeLists does

FreeLists provides a mailing list (sometimes called "group") functionality where by one or more subscribers "posts" (sends an email) to an address at the Service that results in emails further being sent to other subscribers who have opted to receive the communications. It might be thought of as a giant, automated Cc: list. Lists take the form of both newsletters (one-way) and discussion fora (many-to-many).

Our customers self-manage thousands of such lists. Their subscribers (list members) must opt-in and consent to receive the content posted.

Posted content is public. We archive everything as a means of growing public knowledge.

### What FreeLists does not do

The Service is not a marketing service, platform, or conduit. We don't participate in advertising, lead generation, analytics, or any form of tracking. We aren't an e-commerce platform. We don't provide "leads" or "contacts." We don't send SPAM.

The Service is not commercial. Though we do our best to provide a reliable offering, we provide no warranty for fitness of the service, express or implied -- see below. The Service is provided free of charge.

Violation of another's rights may result in immediate termination of Service; repeat offenders guarantee termination;
5. Agree that your posts (content) may not include pornography, adult content or nudity. We foster an open and inclusive environment but ask you to use common sense judgement when it comes to how acceptable content will be;
6. Agree that any suggestions or comments you submit to FreeLists, including but not limited to ideas for or potential improvements to the Service are both non-confidential and become our property.
