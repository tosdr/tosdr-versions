### 1.2 Submission Detail

Keywords, Ratings, Categories, Themes, and Species are used to define images as they appear in Fur Affinity's search engine. Abuse of these (misleading, inaccurate, or false) is not allowed. This does not apply to the Gender section. Submission file type should correspond to submission type. Intentionally listing inaccurate keywords in the description is not allowed.

2\. All Media
-------------

### 2.1 Submissions Used as Reminders

Users may post reminder submissions so long as they meet all of the requirements below:

* One (1) submission used as a reminder may be uploaded per 24 hour time frame. This limit applies to all accounts owned by the creator.
* Submission rating must match the highest content rating of the submission(s) being promoted.
* Reminders may not be posted on behalf of other creators.

### 2.2 Sales Submissions

Users may post sale submissions so long as they meet all of the requirements below:

* Goods being sold through submissions may only be user-created or handcrafted items.
* Sales submissions cannot be removed and reposted more than once every 24 hours.
* Once a sale submission is uploaded, that same sale may not be uploaded to any other accounts owned by the creator.
* Sales posts may not be posted on behalf of other creators.
* The submission rating must reflect the final product.

### 2.3 Stream Notices

Submissions used to inform users that they are streaming are allowed. The rating of the submission must appropriately reflect the rating of the stream's content according to our Content Guidelines (see section 1.1). Stream notifications may be removed and reposted only after 4 hours have elapsed and you are still streaming. Streaming notices must still comply with all other rules in this document.

### 2.4 Stream Restrictions

Users may not link to streams whose sole purpose is the broadcasting of copyrighted content (movies, TV shows, music). This does not apply to Let's Play or game streams.

### 2.5 Citing Sources

Content that was not made explicitly by you that is used as part of your submission (such as free-to-use lineart, backgrounds, or royalty-free content) must cite its original source and be used with permission from the copyright holder. All permissions and copyright holders must be cited in the content's description. If an artist or character owner wished to be kept anonymous they must be credited as anonymous.

### 2.6 Content Not Made By You / For You

Content that was neither made by nor for the uploader is not allowed, unless part of a derivative work (see section 2.5 for more information), or a group that has permission from the copyright holder. All permissions and copyright holders must be cited in the content's description. A group is defined as a user account dedicated to showcasing content of a chosen theme with others who share similar interests for the purpose of building a community and giving artists exposure.

### 2.7 Content Involving Minors

Content featuring minors is not allowed when the minor is in the presence of sexual activity, sexual objects, or nudity, though exceptions may be made for non-sexual depictions of birth and breastfeeding. Presence is defined as being in the same scene, such as sharing a comic panel, contiguous image, reference sheet, or specific section of a story where characters are engaging each other.

Minors may not have detailed bulges or outlines of normal or hyper genitalia, clothed or otherwise. Minors may not be fetishized. Minors may not be depicted as pregnant. Minors are defined as real or fictional humanoids with a childlike body or younger than 18 years old, and any adolescent animals or fantasy creatures.

### 2.8 Content Lacking Artistic Merit

Content lacking artistic merit is not permitted on FA, and includes such items as:

* Photography focusing on body parts without creative content.
* Placeholder content with empty documents or blank submissions.
* Text-only imagery.
* Content modified to be generally unviewable through use of filters, blurring, or censorship.

### 2.9 Duplicate Content

Duplicate content is not allowed.

### 2.10 Flashing Images

Content that may be seizure inducing or contains rapidly flashing images is not allowed.

### 2.11 Traced, Plagiarized, or Stolen Content

Traced, plagiarized, or stolen content is not allowed. This includes any character that is heavily derived from another user's unique character.

### 2.12 Content Involving Real Hate Groups or Terrorist Organizations

Content which displays imagery, language, or rhetoric associated with real world hate groups (e.g. Nazism, ISIS, KKK), terrorists, mass murderers, or serial killers is not allowed whether that content promotes, denounces, or incidentally features these groups and their symbols.

### 2.13 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Content made using AI, machine learning, or similar generators is not allowed, including derivative works created from it (e.g. stories, audio, backgrounds, paint-overs, using one's own content to generate new content).

3\. Photography
---------------

### 3.1 Sexual Activity

Photography featuring sexual activity (human or animal) is not allowed.

### 3.2 Adult Objects

Photography displaying adult toys (sex toys or sexually modified objects) is not allowed unless you created them from scratch, they are not in use, not being worn, don't show signs of having been in use, and you mark them with the adult content rating.

### 3.3 Indecent Photography

Photography depicting nudity or physical contact with nudity (exposed buttocks, breasts, bulges, outlines of genitalia, etc.), indecently-clothed models (undergarments, diapers, lingerie, etc.) is not allowed. Exceptions may be made for swimsuits worn in public locations, such as a pool or beach, but not activities such as breastfeeding.

### 3.4 Bodily Fluids, Gore, Injuries, Death

Photography containing bodily fluids (with the exception of saliva), gore/injuries, or death is not allowed, unless the content is fake, special effects, or the final product of taxidermy when the pelt is preserved in good condition and the presentation is in good taste. This includes freeze dry and wet taxidermy as well as bones and finished pelts, but excludes anything raw or gory.

### 3.5 Photos Of Others’ Work

Photography focusing on artwork or photographs that you do not own or have express permission to photograph and display is not allowed.

### 3.6 Animals Eating

Photography of animals eating other animals, living or pre-frozen, is not allowed. This does not include foodstuff like chicken breasts, steak, or kibble.

4\. Screenshots and 3D Models
-----------------------------

### 4.1 Screenshots

Screenshots of applications, copyrighted content (movies, tv shows, etc), or websites are not allowed, unless showcasing new, original, user-created content (models, textures, etc). This rule does not apply to games with user created content (Garry's Mod, Second Life, Minecraft, IMVU, etc).

5\. Music and Audio
-------------------

### 5.1 Disruptive Audio

Audio that is intentionally disruptive (e.g. loud, screeching) is not allowed.
