* Every member of staff must be alert for the possibility that AC Group’s services could be used for money laundering purposes, or that in the course of their work they could become aware of criminal or terrorist property.
* Alertness to the possibility of money laundering must be combined with an appropriate knowledge of Platform User’ normal arrangements so that members of staff become aware of abnormal factors which may represent possible causes of suspicion.
* A member of staff becoming aware of a possible suspicion shall gather relevant information that is routinely available to them and decide whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering. Any additional information acquired, in particular any explanations for unusual instructions or transactions, should be recorded on the accounts registered on the platform in the routine manner, but no mention of suspected money laundering is to be recorded in any such accounts.
* The requirement to gather relevant information does not extend to undertaking research or investigation, beyond using information sources readily available within AC Group.
* If after gathering and considering routinely available information, the member of staff is entirely satisfied that reasonable grounds for suspicion are not present, no further action should be taken.
* A member of staff who on consideration decides that there may be grounds for suspicion shall in normal circumstances raise the matter with the responsible AC Officer. If after discussion they both agree that there are no grounds for suspicion, no further action should be taken.
* No member of staff is obliged to discuss a suspicion of money laundering with the responsible AC Officer. They may, if in the circumstances they prefer, contact the Compliance Officer directly without giving a reason.
* If following the raising of a possible suspicion by a member of staff, or resulting from their own observations, the responsible AC Officer decides that there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering, he or she must submit a suspicion report to the Compliance Officer, in the format specified by the Compliance Officer for that purpose.
* An internal suspicion report does not lead to the breach of confidentiality, and no member of staff shall fail to make an internal report on those grounds.
* If a suspicion report results from a matter raised by a member of support staff, the responsible AC Officer must advise them in writing that a report has been submitted by reference to the matter discussed on the given date, without including the name of the person(s) suspected. This confirms to the member of staff who raised the matter that their legal obligation to report has been fulfilled. (reporting procedure format)
* In the circumstance where any member of staff forms a suspicion of money laundering but the responsible AC Officer does not agree that there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, the member of staff forming the suspicion must fulfil their legal obligation by submitting a money laundering suspicion report to the Compliance Officer , in the format specified by the Compliance Officer for that purpose. The responsible AC Officer must recognise this legal requirement and assist the staff member in fulfilling it.
* A member of staff who forms or is aware of a suspicion of money laundering shall not discuss it with any outside party, or any other member of staff unless directly involved in the matter causing suspicion.
* No member of staff shall at any time disclose a money laundering suspicion to the person suspected (including an outside party). If circumstances arise that may cause difficulties, the member of staff must seek and follow the instructions of the Compliance Officer .
* No copies or records of money laundering suspicion reports are to be made, except by the Compliance Officer who will keep such records secure, and separate from AC Group’s Platform User accounts and other repositories of information.

POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR FORMAL DISCLOSURES TO THE AUTHORITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------

### POLICY

It is the policy of AC Group that the Compliance Officer shall receive and evaluate internal suspicion reports, and decide whether a formal disclosure is to be made to the authorities. If so deciding, the Compliance Officer will make the formal disclosure on behalf of AC Group, using the appropriate mechanism.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-----------------------

* On receipt of a money laundering suspicion report from a member of staff, the Compliance Officer shall acknowledge its receipt in writing, referring to the report by its date and unique file number, without including the name of the person(s) suspected. This confirms to the member of staff that their legal obligation to report has been fulfilled.
* The Compliance Officer shall open and maintain a log of the progress of the report. This log shall be held securely and shall not form part of the Platform User account.
* Following receipt of a report, the Compliance Officer shall gather all relevant information held within AC Group, and make all appropriate enquiries of members of staff anywhere in AC Group, in order properly to evaluate the report. The Compliance Officer shall then decide whether they personally believe there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, and make a decision on AC Group’s obligation to make a formal disclosure to the authorities.
* Before actually making a formal disclosure to the authorities, the Compliance Officer will have to seek advice from AC Group’s owner. AC Group’s owner will have the final decision on whether to make a formal disclosure to the authorities.
* All members of staff, anywhere in AC Group, shall respond in full to all enquiries made by the Compliance Officer for the purposes of evaluating a suspicion report. Information provided to the Compliance Officer in response to such enquiries does not breach any confidentiality/professional privilege, and no member of staff shall withhold information on those grounds.
* If it has been decided that a formal disclosure to the authorities is required, the Compliance Officer shall make such disclosure by the appropriate means.
* The Compliance Officer shall document in the report log the reasons for deciding to make or not to make a formal disclosure.
* The Compliance Officer shall where appropriate inform the originator of the internal report whether or not a formal disclosure has been made.
* The Compliance Officer shall inform all those, and only those, members of staff who need to be aware of the suspicion in order to protect them and AC Group from possible money laundering offences in connection with any related business.
* Following a formal disclosure, the Compliance Officer shall take such actions as required by the authorities in connection with the disclosure.

POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR BLOCKING/CONTINUING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRED ON THE PLATFORM FOLLOWING A SUSPICION REPORT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### POLICY

It is the policy of AC Group that from the moment a suspicion of money laundering arises, the registered account will be blocked. Neither commercial considerations nor the difficulty in responding to the enquiries of the persons registered on the platform on the matter shall be permitted to take precedence over AC Group’s legal obligations in this regard.

### CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

* As soon as a member of staff forms or becomes aware of a suspicion of money laundering, the registered account will be blocked.
* If there is any likelihood of the awareness that the registered account has been blocked, for example because an anticipated transaction has not gone through, the member of staff concerned must contact the Compliance Officer for instructions on how to handle the matter.
* On receipt of a suspicion report, the Compliance Officer shall instruct the originator of the report and any other staff involved to block the registered account giving rise to suspicion
* When an registered account has been blocked, the Compliance Officer shall carry out the evaluation of the suspicion report as quickly as possible to decide whether a disclosure must be made to the authorities.
* If the Compliance Officer decides that there are not reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering, he or she will give consent for continuing the registered account on his or her own authority.
* If the Compliance Officer decides that a disclosure must be made, he or she will request consent to continue from the AC Group’s owner as quickly as possible. The AC Group’s owner will have the final decision on AC Group’s continuation of the registered account.
