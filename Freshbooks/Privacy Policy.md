Privacy Policy
==============

****Last Updated:** March 22, 2023**

This is the Privacy Policy of (i) the FreshBooks website: [https://www.freshbooks.com](https://www.freshbooks.com/) (the “Site”), (ii) any other website where this Privacy Policy is hosted that is owned and operated by 2NDSITE Inc.

De C.V. \[Facturama\], and FreshBooks d.o.o., and any future affiliates or subsidiaries, (“FreshBooks”, “we”, “us”, “our” and terms of similar meaning) (such other websites are, for purposes of this Privacy Policy included in the definitions of “Site”); and (iii)  our related products and services. It describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we disclose and secure this information. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.

By accepting the Privacy Policy in registration or by visiting and using the Site, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our [Terms of Service](https://qa-web-k8s.freshenv.com/policies/terms-of-service).

In this Privacy Policy, we use the following terms to describe different types of visitors to our Site. Our customers are called “Subscribers” and our Subscribers’ customers are called “Customers”. We use the word “staff” to describe persons to whom Subscribers give “staff” access on the Site. Together with registered users of our forum or other interactive areas of the Site, these people are collectively described in this Privacy Policy as “Users” of our Site.

* **Subscribers and Customers Information:** In the normal operation of the Site Subscriber timesheets (including information entered by “staff” members) and invoices are disclosed to the applicable Customers, and Customer information is disclosed to the applicable Subscriber. In general, information you enter on the Site is available to the other persons – whether they are Customers, Subscribers, staff members or others – to whom you give access to your account or to whom you give access to the information through the normal operation of the Site.
* **Payment Information:** We use credit card and other personally identifiable information (such as payment processor email addresses) you submit to us on the Site, and other information that we collect, as required, to process payments you make through the Site through our payment processor intermediaries.

We may also share personally identifiable information with our payment processor intermediaries for risk management and fraud prevention.

If you do choose to request such products or services, we will provide your information to the relevant third party on your behalf, as required to provide the products or services you have requested. We do not control the use, storage, retention, processing, or disclosure of your information by such third parties, and this Privacy Policy will not apply to them. Your relationship with these third parties will generally be subject to their separate terms and conditions as well as privacy policies or statements, and we recommend that you carefully review these documents before requesting their products or services.

For example, we may use the services of third party hosting companies to host the operation of the Site. This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable, have equivalent or better security safeguards in place than us, and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information.

We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

**Consent for Withdrawal**

We provide you a way for you to withdraw your information being processed for individuals within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the State of California.

Contact us at privacy@freshbooks.com to initiate the steps required. We will verify your information prior to processing and proceed with the steps necessary within the applicable laws and regulations.

If you are not a resident of the EEA or the State of California but wish to no longer be subscribed to emails or direct mail campaigns, please reach out to our support team at [help@freshbooks.com](mailto:help@freshbooks.com)

**Correcting, Updating, and Transferring Your Personal Information**

Upon written request FreshBooks will provide you with information about what personal information we have about you. To review, delete, and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate, you may login into your account to make the changes, or you may contact us at [privacy@freshbooks.com](mailto:privacy@freshbooks.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe, and typically within one month of the request being made. We may ask you for further information from you to help us respond to your request, including asking for government-issued identification to verify your identity before we provide the personal data. If you are a EEA resident requesting the porting or an export of your information, you may reach out to us at [privacy@freshbooks.com](mailto:privacy@freshbooks.com) and we will proceed with the steps necessary.

**Account Deletion**

FreshBooks is a complex business network that connects millions of users. FreshBooks manages a business eco system that brings together contractors, companies and customers. This network relies on the exchange and sharing of information that is important to others in your network. Tracked hours, sent invoices, paid invoices, contractor invoices are all vital to other people that work with you. These are the official history of work done and moneys paid. The complexity and connected nature of the system requires that this history exists for as long a time as necessary to accommodate proper function and accounting for the other systems that you have connected to via contracting hours, invoices, estimates. FreshBooks will reasonably assure that information, where it is no longer required for the proper functioning of the service, will be deleted in a compliant manner and will consider any deletion request within the requirements of applicable law.

When a customer chooses to close an account we will remove your information from our marketing and billing systems. This will ensure that there are not further mailings or billings directed towards the canceled user.

**Data Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

Our goal is to retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations and accepted accounting principles, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; this retention period may extend past the point at which you close your account.

The criteria that will be for determining periods of retention will be based on the type of data. For example, data relevant to accounting information will be retained for at least 7 years, whereas temporary cookie data of a web visitor may not be retained at all.

**International Transfer of Personal Information**

Other than as specified within this Policy, we do not share your personal information with third parties. Where we do transfer your personal information to third parties or service providers, appropriate arrangements will be made in order to ensure correct and secure data processing in compliance with applicable data protection law.

We store personal information about Website Visitors and Subscribers within Canada, the United States and in other countries and territories. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which FreshBooks has operations. Therefore, your personal information may be processed outside of the UK, the EEA and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the UK Secretary of State or the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the UK or the EEA.

In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior and explicit consent to such international data transfers.We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA. For further details on the transfer of your personal information, including a list of the organizations with whom said information may be shared**,** please reach out to our team at [privacy@freshbooks.com](mailto:privacy@freshbooks.com).

**Security Safeguards**

For more details on how we protect your data, please see our [https://qa-web-k8s.freshenv.com/policies/security-safeguards](https://qa-web-k8s.freshenv.com/policies/security-safeguards) page.

**Supplemental Policy Information**

_Invitations:_ 

You have the opportunity to invite others to work with you through your FreshBooks account. To do that, FreshBooks asks you to import or to manually enter your contacts’ email addresses. As you direct, we then send them an invitation on your behalf or other notices reflecting changes you make to their status in your account.

If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the FreshBooks site and go to the site you selected. If you elect to use a third party product or service in conjunction with FreshBooks, you yourself enter into a license agreement with the third party for use of their product or service and their use of your data. This will be notified to you at the relevant time. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as FreshBooks. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a FreshBooks site, you should read that site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information.

With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at [privacy@freshbooks.com](mailto:privacy@freshbooks.com).

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

_Residents of Canada_

Personal information (as the term is defined in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of Canada (“PIPEDA”)) will be collected, stored, used and/or processed by the FreshBooks in compliance with the FreshBooks’s obligations under PIPEDA.

_California Residents_

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which is effective as of January 1, 2020, regulates how we handle personal information of California residents and gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information.

FreshBooks is both a “business” and a “service provider” under the CCPA. The following supplemental privacy policy applies to information we collect in our role as a business—this is when we interact directly with you.

When we act as a service provider (for example, by providing our services to another company that you interact with), we follow the instructions of the business that engaged us with respect to how we process your personal information. If you would like more information about how your personal information is processed by other companies, including companies that engage us as a service provider, please contact those companies directly.

This supplemental privacy policy is effective as of January 1, 2020, shall apply only to residents of California, and may be subject to change. The general privacy policy shall continue to apply to the extent that it applies to you as a resident of California. If you are a resident of California, we are required to disclose certain uses and disclosures in a certain format, as well as to inform you of certain rights you may have. Any capitalized terms used in this supplemental privacy policy shall have the same meaning as in the general privacy policy.

_European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) Visitors_

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to provide you with our Services), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time why we need to use your personal information. If we process personal information in reliance on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.

If you have questions about, or need further information concerning, the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information in any specific instance, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” section below.

In the UK, FreshBooks provides you with regulated account information services as an agent of Plaid Financial Ltd., an authorised payment institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (Firm Registration Number: 804718) for the provision of payment services, including account information services.

**Notification of Privacy Statement Changes**

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.
