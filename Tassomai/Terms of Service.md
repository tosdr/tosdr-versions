Tassomai may be accessed online via our Website or via the Tassomai App and the

Student Users may begin the Tassomai Course once their user profile is completed.



5.2. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Tassomai Course you have selected is

suitable for the Student Users. Student Users should be aware that completion of each

Tassomai Course requires significant effort and regular participation. Some modules of

a Tassomai Course may require more effort and time than other modules and

progression through a Tassomai Course is not linear. In some cases, there may be

more effort required at the end of the Tassomai Course than in the earlier stages.



5.3. Courses are designed around the specifications set by the relevant Examination Body.



5.4. We undertake to you that the Tassomai Course(s) provided will be in accordance with

acceptable industry practice and standards.



5.5. Access to Tassomai Courses is usually for a specified time such as the academic year

and Student Users are encouraged to complete the particular course during the

recommended time.



5.6. Tassomai Course content may change over time in order to take account of changes in

the National Curriculum and/or exam specifications. Some changes may be made to

clarify ambiguities, correct errors or to revise or update language.



5.7. It is your responsibility to regularly monitor the Student User engagement and

attainment to ensure that the Student User is making the expected progress.



6. Our “9 to 5” Grade Guarantee Courses



6.1. For Student Users who successfully participate and complete our designated “9 to 5”

Grade Guarantee Courses we guarantee that the Student User will obtain a “9 to 5”

GCSE Grade in that particular subject examination (excluding coursework and practical

work) by the relevant Examination Board or we will refund the Refund Amount for that

Tassomai Course in respect of that particular Student User only.



6.2. The Refund Amount is calculated based on the unit price per Student User per course

as stated on the Tassomai Setup Form which is then split evenly between the different

examinations being taken by that Student User (“Fee Split”) and the amount to be

refunded shall be equal to the Fee Split for each paper where the Student User has

achieved the level required on Tassomai and has not achieved a 9 to 5 Grade.



6.3. In order to operate the “9 to 5” Grade guarantee and to also enable Tassomai to

assess the efficacy of the content and software, to correlate results with students’

usage and to further enhance or improve our provision of the learning resource in

future, we require all Schools to provide full results of Student Users’ examination

scores and grade results irrespective of whether the School believes the Student User

may have qualified for the guarantee refund.



6.4. In order to claim a Refund Amount the following conditions must be met to our

reasonable satisfaction:



6.4.1. The Student User must have participated and completed 80% of all modules

and achieved a progress score of at least 80% in each and all topic tests within

each module of the specific “9 to 5” Grade Guarantee Course;



6.4.2. The Student User must not have received assistance from another source,

internet bot or tool, computer program or another person;



6.4.3. The Tassomai Course must not have been accessed by anyone other than the

Student User;



6.4.4. The examination which the Student User sits must award grades with “9” being

the highest grade. International Baccalaureates or other examinations which

award different merits such as points do not qualify for the guarantee;



6.4.5. You must notify us within 14 days of the GCSE result date of the results

achieved by each of the Student Users.



6.4.6. It is for the School and the Teacher to ensure that the Student User optimises

their use of Tassomai in order to ensure maximum benefit and to avail of the

guarantee. Tassomai is not at fault for the Student User not achieving the

guarantee.

6.5. If we have reasonable grounds to believe that any one of the requirements set out in

Clause 6.4 is not met then we reserve the right not to make a refund.



6.6. All refunds will be made within 30 days of receipt of the refund application and will, at

our option, either be paid via bank transfer to your nominated bank account or a

credit issued against the next Licence Fee.

Agreement and we shall ensure that any such third party processor is obliged to

party processor, we shall first notify you. If, within 5 business days of receipt of such

grounds then we shall not appoint the proposed third party processor until reasonable

steps have been taken to address the objections raised by you and you have been

provided with reasonable written explanation of the steps taken.
