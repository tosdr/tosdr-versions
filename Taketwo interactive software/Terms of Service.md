**1\. Your Use of the Services****.**
-------------------------------------

**1.1 Age Restrictions and Legal Responsibility.** As used in this Agreement, “you” or “your” means the individual user interacting with our Services; if such user is under 18 (or the minimum legal age of adulthood in your country), then “you” or “your” means the user’s parent or legal guardian entering into this Agreement on the user’s behalf. You, or any person under your supervision, should only use the Services if you, or the person under your supervision, are above the minimum age rating for the applicable Service. Minors under 18 (or the legal age of adulthood in your country), must ask their parent or guardian to review and explain this Agreement to them, and to agree to this Agreement on their behalf. If you accept this Agreement on behalf of a minor, you should supervise the minor’s use of the Services, including any Virtual Items or Account used by such minor. If you are the parent or guardian of a minor and you agreed to this Agreement on their behalf, you agree that you will be responsible for all uses of the Services, including any Virtual Items or Accounts, by your child whether or not such uses were explicitly authorized by you. You are legally and financially responsible for all of your actions while using or accessing the Services, including the actions of anyone you allow to access the Services or your Account.

**1.2 Modifications to This Agreement.** We reserve the right to modify this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. We will endeavor to notify you of any such modifications in advance of the modified Agreement taking effect. If you do not wish to agree to the terms of the modified Agreement, you may no longer be able to access the Services once the modified Agreement takes effect. We will try to inform you about this legal consequence when notifying you of the modified Agreement. By actively accepting the modified Agreement, or by continuing to use the Services after the modified Agreement becomes effective, you agree to be bound by the modified terms of this Agreement. If you do not wish to agree to the modified Agreement, you may terminate your use of the Services without any charge being payable to us (but you remain liable for any unpaid amounts due and payable to any Digital Storefront as set out in Section 4 below).

**1.3 Your Account.** Some elements of the Services may require that you create an account, whereas for other Services, an account may be automatically created for you when you access the Services for the first time (each an “**Account**”). To create an Account, you may be asked to provide your age information and country/region, and then provide an email address, a username, a password, and such other information as we may deem necessary in connection with the creation of your Account, all of which will be processed and stored in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.take2games.com/privacy). You must provide accurate, current, and complete information about you when creating an Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account username and password secret. You also agree not to sell, transfer, or share your Account, or your Account’s username or password, and you agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account. We have the right to deny the creation of any Account, for any legitimate reason, and we reserve the right to terminate any Account that violates this Agreement in accordance with the termination provisions below and to delete any Account information in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.take2games.com/privacy).

**2\. Limited License****.**
----------------------------

**2.1 We Reserve All Rights to our IP.** We, and our licensors, own and reserve all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services, Virtual Items, and your Account (excluding any tangible medium the Services may be supplied on), including all: (1) information, text, data, files, code, scripts, designs, graphics, artwork, illustrations, photographs, sounds, music, titles, themes, objects, characters, names, dialogue, locations, stories, plot, animation, concepts, audio-visual effects, virtual goods and in-game currency (including Virtual Items), interactive features, gameplay, methods of operation, the compilation, assembly, and arrangement of the materials of the Services, Virtual Items, or your Account, and all other copyrightable material; (2) trademarks, logos, trade names, trade dress, service marks, and trade identities of various parties, including ours; and (3) other forms of intellectual property (all of the foregoing, collectively “**Content**”).

**2.2 Your Personal, Non-Commercial Use.** Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Services, including Virtual Items and your Account, for your personal, non-commercial enjoyment. The Services, Virtual Items, or your Account, including the Content, but excluding any tangible medium the Services may be supplied on, are licensed, not sold. This license is personal to you only and does not give you any ownership rights in any of the Services, Virtual Items, or your Account (or in or to any of their features or Content).

**2.3 Restrictions.** The limited license granted in this Agreement does not give you any right to, and you may not, sell, copy (except under applicable legal exceptions such as the “private copy” exception under applicable law), loan, lease, distribute, disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, derive source code from, reverse engineer (except where permitted under applicable legal exceptions deriving from EU Directive 2009/24 or other applicable law), modify, create derivative works, commercialize, or otherwise exploit the Services (including the Content), Virtual Items, or your Account unless subject to separate, express written terms provided by Take-Two permitting such conduct. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing in the limited license granted in this Agreement authorizes the use of the Services (including the Content), Virtual Items, or your Account in any manner to develop, train, enhance, or provide source material for, or promote, any Generative AI Tools; and for the avoidance of doubt, any such uses are hereby explicitly prohibited. “**Generative AI Tools**” means any tool or computer program that uses algorithms or technology commonly known as artificial intelligence or machine learning to create or generate content such as, but not limited to, software code, written text, still or moving images, musical works, human voice emulation, audio material, or other creative works based on text, image, sound prompts, or other inputs. If we terminate your Account or this Agreement in accordance with the provisions below, any license from us to you to use the Services, Virtual Items, your Account, or any Content, ends immediately.

**2.4 Legal Effect.** This license describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country. This license does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country don’t permit it to do so.

**3\. Virtual Items****.**
--------------------------

“**Virtual Items”** means any virtual currency, goods, items, boosts, or effects such as, but not limited to, coins, points, gems, tokens, weapons, vehicles, cards, skins, power-ups, apparel, equipment, trophies, rewards, badges, or any other in-game virtual asset made available, purchased from a Digital Storefront, earned, or otherwise acquired through the Services. Virtual Items are licensed under the terms of this Agreement and nothing herein shall be interpreted as transferring any rights or ownership interest in such Virtual Items to you. Virtual Items are only available to users in certain locations, and, unless otherwise stated in your agreement with the relevant Digital Storefront, you may not purchase or use Virtual Items if you are not in an approved location. Virtual Items may only be redeemed for content made available through the Services, which is generally game-specific. Virtual Items have no monetary value, cannot be used outside of the Services, and may not be sold, transferred or redeemed for real money or items of value outside of the Services unless subject to separate, express written terms provided by Take-Two permitting such conduct. We have the right to modify, delete, move, remove, or suspend any Virtual Items at any time with or without notice to you and with no liability of any kind to you. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Items that may be held for any one game or that may be held in your Account in the aggregate. We may limit the period of time during which you may hold or use Virtual Items related to any particular game or other aspect of the Services. Additionally, the price and availability of Virtual Items to purchase or acquire are subject to change. You agree that you have no ownership or other rights in or to any Virtual Items or your Account.

**4\. Purchases, Billing, and Subscriptions**.
----------------------------------------------

**4.1 Digital Storefronts.** Some aspects of the Services and some Virtual Items may require you to pay a fee through a storefront operated by us or a third-party (each a “**Digital Storefront**”). Your contractual partner in providing these Services and Virtual Items to you will be the Digital Storefront. Your purchase through the Digital Storefront is subject to any applicable terms or conditions imposed by the Digital Storefront (“**Storefront Terms**”), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. You are responsible for all charges in relation to your purchase from such Digital Storefront and must provide accurate and complete payment information to the Digital Storefront. We may suspend or cancel the applicable Services or supply of Virtual Items if the Digital Storefront informs us that they did not receive full payment from you after reasonable prior notification, or if you obtain, or attempt to obtain, refunds in violation of the applicable Digital Storefront’s policies. Suspension or cancellation of the Services or Virtual Items for non-payment to the Digital Storefront could result in a loss of access to and use of your Account and any Content or Services. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no liability to you in the event that your access to any of the Services is terminated by a Digital Storefront as a result of your breach of their Storefront Terms.

**4.2 Subscriptions.** Some aspects of the Services may be offered on a subscription basis with automatic, recurring payments at the start of each billing period (“**Subscription**”). We reserve the right to modify the terms on which such features are offered for purchase at any time on thirty (30) days’ notice. Please note some Subscriptions are offered subject to additional terms and conditions, which may modify the terms below.

**(1)3 Purchase.** Subscriptions can be purchased from a Digital Storefront. To use a Subscription, you must: hold a valid entitlement to the product or service related to the Subscription; have a valid account with the Digital Storefront including a current, valid, and accepted method of payment registered to that account; and have an internet connection. The Digital Storefront will bill the applicable Subscription fee (and any applicable taxes) (“**Fee**”) to your chosen method of payment on each Subscription renewal date. After purchase, your Subscription(s) will activate, and you will receive access to the benefits associated with the Subscription listed at the time of your enrollment.

**(2) Automatic Renewal & Cancelation.** Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period. The Digital Storefront will charge your payment method for the then-current Fee unless you cancel your Subscription through the applicable Digital Storefront before your current billing period ends. You may cancel a Subscription at any time, which will prevent auto-renewal and terminate the Subscription at the end of your current billing period. If you cancel, you will continue to receive benefits until the Subscription terminates at the end of your then-current billing period. Please see the Storefront Terms for applicable refund policies, if any.

**(3) Changes to Subscriptions**. The terms of any Subscription and the benefits included in such Subscription may change from time to time. Benefits changes may include altering or removing previously claimed benefits. Take-Two may also retire a Subscription at any time on no less than thirty (30) days’ notice. Any such changes will be updated on the Digital Storefront’s Subscription product page, and you may receive email notice from Take-Two and/or the Digital Storefront about any such changes before they occur. **Please read any notification of changes carefully. If you do not cancel your Subscription after receiving notice of a change to the terms of the Subscription – including the amount of the Fee – or the benefits included in the Subscription, then you will be deemed to have accepted those changes. Changes will go into effect upon auto-renewal of your Subscription or the date on which you otherwise explicitly accept any such changes, if earlier.**

**5\. User Generated and Custom Content****.**
----------------------------------------------

**5.1 User Generated Content.** “**UGC**” includes all digital content or communications that users create, upload, or distribute via the Services, including but not limited to: text, posts, audio, or audio-visual communications; code, scripts, textures, models, maps, files, or other assets or documents; photos, images, video, or any other audio or audio-visual works; and any feedback or suggestions related to the Services. UGC specifically excludes Custom Content (defined below). You are solely responsible for the UGC that you create, upload, or distribute via the Services (“**Your UGC**”) and you hereby represent to us that Your UGC will not violate this Agreement including, without limitation, the terms of Section 6.

**5.2 Rights to UGC**. You retain whatever rights, if any, you may have under applicable law in Your UGC. If you do hold any such rights to Your UGC, including any copyright or other intellectual property interest, then, in exchange for the rights licensed to you in this Agreement, you hereby grant us an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and sublicensable right to use, reproduce, edit, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on, publish, distribute, transmit, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit Your UGC within or via the Services or for any other commercial and non-commercial purpose related to the Services, including but not limited to the improvement of the Services, without compensation or notice, for the full duration of the intellectual property rights pertaining to Your UGC (including all revivals, reversions, and extensions of those rights). Without limiting the foregoing, the rights licensed to Take-Two herein explicitly include the right for Take-Two to allow other users to use Your UGC as part of our operation of the Services. By creating, uploading, or distributing Your UGC to or via the Services, you represent to us that you own any rights in and to Your UGC on a sole and unencumbered basis, and that any such rights you grant to us in this Section, and our exploitation of those rights, will not violate or infringe the rights of any third parties.

**5.3 Custom Content.** Some of our Services allow you to use our tools, editing software, in-game functionality, or other features provided by us (“**Our Tools**”) to edit the Content to (for example) create custom levels, maps, in-game assets, designs, apparel, characters, livery, courses, games, or other content based on the Content (“**Custom Content**”). Custom Content includes, without limitation, all content created using Our Tools including in-game assets, maps, screenshots, videos, recordings of in-game audio, gameplay clips, and livestreams. You may only use Custom Content with the Services and/or only as authorized by us. You are solely responsible for the Custom Content you create and agree that such Custom Content will not violate this Agreement including, without limitation, the terms in Section 6.

**5.4 Rights to Custom Content.** Take-Two reserves all rights to and ownership of all Custom Content under applicable law. If, under applicable law, your creation of Custom Content results in you holding any intellectual property rights in such Custom Content then, in exchange for the rights licensed to you in this Agreement, you hereby freely assign us, upon the creation of such Custom Content, all right, title, and interest in and to such Custom Content, including without limitation, all intellectual property rights throughout the world for the full duration of such intellectual property rights (including all revivals, reversions, and extensions of those rights). If, despite the foregoing assignment, you for any reason retain any intellectual property interest or other rights in the Custom Content, then you hereby grant to us an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and sublicensable right, to use, reproduce, edit, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on, publish, distribute, transmit, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit such Custom Content within or via the Services or for any other commercial and non-commercial purpose related to the Services, including but not limited to the improvement of the Services, without compensation or notice, for the full duration of the intellectual property rights pertaining to such Custom Content (including all revivals, reversions, and extensions of those rights). Without limiting the foregoing, the rights licensed to Take-Two herein explicitly include the right for Take-Two to allow other users to use such Custom Content as part of our operation of the Services.

**5.5 Content Moderation; Right to Remove.** We have no obligation to host, maintain, support, or distribute any of Your UGC or the Custom Content that you create. We have not necessarily reviewed and are not obligated to actively monitor any UGC or Custom Content that may be available via the Services. We do not confirm the security, quality, or originality of any UGC or Custom Content. UGC and Custom Content do not represent the views of Take-Two or its management, employees, or any other person associated with us. You understand that we may modify, take-down, suppress, block, hide, remove, or delete any or all UGC or Custom Content, and report any illegal UGC or Custom Content and any related user information to the appropriate authorities. Consistent with our obligations under applicable law, if we take adverse action against Your UGC or the Custom Content you create from the Services, suspend or ban your Account, or otherwise restrict your access to some or all of the Services, Virtual Items or your Account as a result of Your UGC or the Custom Content you create, we will endeavor to notify you of the same.

We may notify law enforcement or other government agency or regulatory body, and provide any associated personal data as set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.take2games.com/privacy), if the breach involves a threat to the life or safety of yourself or others, or any other activity that we believe to be unlawful. We reserve the right to take adverse action against you based on information we might receive from third parties including, without limitation, other users, law enforcement, government agencies or other regulatory authorities. We are not liable for any violation of this Agreement by you or by any other user.

**6.8 Monitoring; User Tools and Automated Systems.** We may (but are not obligated to) actively monitor use of the Services for a variety of different purposes, including preventing cheating and hacking; ensuring your compliance with this Agreement; enforcing the terms of this Agreement; and improving the Services.

The Services may employ moderation and filtering systems, such as automated word filters and content or symbol-recognition software, which are intended to prevent or cease the distribution of Material that violates this Agreement.

**9\. Your Responsibilities to Us****.**
----------------------------------------

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Take-Two from and against any and all direct liabilities, damages, losses arising out of or in connection with: (1) your breach of this Agreement; (2) any information or content provided by you that infringes the rights of a third party when used by us in accordance with this Agreement; and (3) your unlawful acts or omissions. We can assist, at our own expense, in the defense of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with us, and we will take reasonable steps to mitigate our losses. However, you are not required to indemnify Take-Two in respect of any liabilities, damages or losses arising out of or in connection with the negligent acts or omissions, fraud, or willful misconduct by Take-Two, Take-Two’s officer’s employees, contractors or agents, or to the extent you are not responsible for the breach.

You are solely responsible for any third party costs you incur to use the Services, Virtual Items or your Account.

For any Services, Virtual Items, and/or Account provided to you for an indefinite period of time, we have the right to terminate this Agreement and your access to the Services, Virtual Items and your Account, or cease providing such Services, at any time for any reason in our sole discretion. If we have reasonable means to contact you and where practicable, we will try to inform you reasonably in advance of any such termination or cessation of Services taking effect. Where it is not practicable to inform you in advance, we will try to inform you promptly afterwards. If your habitual residency is in Germany, the right of both parties to extraordinary termination for good cause shall remain unaffected. Good cause exists if the terminating party, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of both parties, cannot reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship until the agreed termination or until the expiry of a notice period.

We may immediately terminate or suspend your right to access any aspect of the Services, Virtual Items, Content, and/or your Account if you: breach this Agreement; use the Services, Virtual Items, or your Account fraudulently, illegally or in any manner other than for its intended purposes; initiate any adverse proceeding against us; or if we are under a legal obligation to do so. If we decide to terminate or suspend your right to access some or all of the Services, Virtual Items, or your Account, we will try to inform you in advance of such termination or suspension unless the action is taken under a legal obligation that does not require us to inform you or if it is not practicable for us to do so.

You acknowledge and agree that if this Agreement is terminated (or we end your right to access any of the Services, Virtual Items, Content, or your Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), the licenses granted to you under this Agreement (or in respect of such Services, Virtual Items, Content, or Account) shall immediately terminate.

**15.5 Dispute Resolution: Binding Individual Arbitration; Waiver of Class Actions and Jury Trials.** If you have an issue with the Services that cannot be resolved by contacting our [Customer Support](https://www.take2games.com/support), this Section 15.5 (the “**Arbitration Agreement**”) explains how you and Take-Two agree to resolve any Disputes by binding, individual arbitration, subject to limited exceptions described below.

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY— IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**(1) Binding Individual Arbitration.** You and Take-Two agree that, if not resolved through the informal negotiation process described below, any Disputes between us shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the exclusions in Section 15.5(10), a “**Dispute**” means any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or related to the Services, including those related to the formation, breach, termination, enforcement, scope, validity, or applicability of the Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, or your rights under those agreements. All Disputes are subject to the Arbitration Agreement regardless of whether they arose before or after you accepted the Agreement.

The arbitrator – not a federal, state, or local court, or government agency – shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Disputes, including those related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, and any claim that all or part of the Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have authority to determine all threshold arbitrability issues, including related to whether the Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement are unconscionable or illusory; whether the Arbitration Agreement has been disaffirmed under applicable law; and any defense to arbitration including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. The arbitrator may award the same remedies as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy the individual Dispute at issue.

**(2) Class Action / Jury Trial Waiver.** You and Take-Two each waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding involving any Disputes in any forum. You and Take-Two each waive all rights to participate in any purported class, collective, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. Unless you and Take-Two agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of consolidated, representative, group, or class proceeding. All Disputes shall be arbitrated on an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis only. This means that the arbitrator will resolve your individual Dispute with Take-Two separate from any other Dispute, and that your Dispute cannot be consolidated or joined with another person’s or party’s claims. The arbitrator may award relief permitted by applicable law only with respect to the individual party seeking relief, but to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, may not award relief respecting any person other than that individual party seeking relief. If any court or arbitrator determines that this Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Take-Two shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes.

**(3) Applicability; Your Right to Opt Out.** This binding individual arbitration requirement will not apply to the extent prohibited by the laws of your country or state of residence. You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept this Agreement (“**Opt-Out Notice**”) unless a longer period is required by applicable law.

Your Opt-Out Notice must be sent to:

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — ARBITRATION OPT-OUT

110 West 44th Street,

New York, New York, 10036

The Opt-Out Notice must include: (1) your full name; (2) your mailing address; (3) your Account name, if you have one; and (4) a clear, signed statement that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement. You are responsible for ensuring our receipt of your Opt-Out Notice; you therefore may want to send your notice using a delivery method that provides you with a written receipt of delivery.

**(4) Dispute Resolution Procedures.** Except for claims brought under Section 15.5(10),any Dispute between you and Take-Two must be resolved through the following steps:

Step 1: Notice of Dispute. If you have a Dispute with us, you must send written notice of the Dispute (“**Notice of Dispute**”) to us at the following address:

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — NOTICE OF DISPUTE

110 West 44th Street,

New York, New York, 10036

To be considered complete, your Notice of Dispute must include the following information: (1) your name, (2) Account name or registered email address you use to access the Services, (3) your mailing address, (4) how to contact you, (5) what the problem is, and (6) what you want us to do about it.

If Take-Two has a Dispute with you, we will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us or, if these options are not available, to other reasonable contact information you have provided us.

Step 2: Informal Negotiation. To help us get to a resolution faster and reduce the costs for both parties, you and Take-Two agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Dispute for at least 30 days. Those informal negotiations will start on the day you or Take-Two receive a written Notice of a Dispute.

Step 3: Binding Arbitration**.** If we cannot resolve the Dispute informally, the Dispute (except as set out in Section 15.5(9) and (10) below) will be resolved exclusively via binding individual arbitration conducted by the [Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.](https://www.jamsadr.com/) (“**JAMS**”) subject to the terms in this Arbitration Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.

**(5) Demand for Arbitration.** The party starting an individual arbitration must send JAMS a “**Demand for Arbitration**” (using the form available on its website), pay any applicable filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. If you have a Dispute with us, you must send a copy of your Demand for Arbitration to:

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION

110 West 44th Street,

New York, New York, 10036

Take-Two will send our copy of our Demand for Arbitration to your registered email address and any billing address you have provided us or, if these options are not available, to other reasonable contact information you have provided us.

**(6) Individual Arbitration Procedure.**

Rules. Individual arbitration between you and Take-Two will occur under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures issued by JAMS as of the date of the Notice of Dispute (the “**JAMS Rules**”) and as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. Please see [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/) for more information about JAMS and the JAMS Rules. You and Take-Two agree that the arbitration will be conducted in English and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Arbitration Agreement.

Discovery and Evidence. Discovery in the arbitration shall be limited to the production of documents that are directly relevant to significant issues in the case or to the case’s outcome. The arbitrator shall make all determinations related to the admissibility or relevance of evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Dispositive Motions & Hearing Location. The arbitrator shall allow for dispositive motions. The location and method of the parties’ appearance at the arbitration proceeding, if any, will be determined by the JAMS Rules.

Confidentiality. The arbitrator shall issue an order providing that the arbitration proceedings and all notices, pleadings, motions, discovery responses, testimony, and documents exchanged or filed related to such proceedings be kept strictly confidential.

Fees. The parties will bear any arbitration costs as determined by the JAMS Rules.

Decision & Award. The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless otherwise agreed, any decision or award shall set forth the factual and legal basis for the award. The arbitrator shall be permitted to award only those remedies permitted by applicable law or in equity which are supported by credible relevant evidence as determined by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Unless Take-Two expressly consents, the arbitrator may not award relief against Take-Two respecting any person other than you. Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on the parties, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and can be enforced like any other court order or judgment.

**(7) Time Limit for Claims.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, if a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or Take-Two must start arbitration of all Disputes within two (2) years of the events giving rise to the Dispute. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two (2) years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Take-Two encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. Failure to timely engage in dispute resolution will permanently bar all claims.

**(8) Non-Arbitrable Claims.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the arbitrator may not legally adjudicate or award a particular legal or equitable claim or remedy, such claim or remedy shall be stayed until all other claims and remedies are final and the arbitration completed. Thereafter, the remaining claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York and, if meritorious, such court may award the remaining remedy. To the extent any claims are allowed to proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, group, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims remaining in arbitration. In all cases described in this Section 15.5(8), the federal or state court shall be bound under the principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator. Suits brought in state court may be removed to federal court by either party if permissible under applicable law.

**(9) Exception – Mass Arbitration Procedure.**

Mass Arbitration. A “**Mass Arbitration**” means 5 or more Disputes relating to the same or similar subject matter, which share common issues of law or fact, or in which the counsel or other organization representing the parties in such Disputes are the same, cooperating, or working in coordination. A “**Mass Arbitration Dispute**” means an individual Dispute that forms a part of a Mass Arbitration. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as authorizing a consolidated, representative, group, or class proceeding. Take-Two reserves all rights and defenses as to each and any Demand for Arbitration and claimant.

Rules for Mass Arbitration. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to have all Disputes administered by JAMS on an individual basis, you and Take-Two agree that if your Dispute is (or becomes) a Mass Arbitration Dispute, it shall not be governed by the JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, Mass Arbitration Disputes shall be administered by New Era and governed by the New Era Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration Disputes are filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “**New Era Rules**”), and this Arbitration Agreement. The New Era Rules are available at [www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures](https://www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-procedures/). For clarity, the New Era Rules shall be modified by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.

Batching of Mass Arbitration Disputes. To facilitate efficient resolution of Mass Arbitrations, after 60 Mass Arbitration Disputes have been accepted related to a single Mass Arbitration (the “**Initial Batch**”), New Era shall not accept any additional Demands for Arbitration related to such Mass Arbitration until 60 days after the final resolution of all Bellwether Cases from the Initial Batch and the subsequent Settlement Conference provided for under the New Era Rules. Thereafter, any additional Mass Arbitration Disputes related to the ongoing Mass Arbitration may be accepted and resolved under the New Era Rules on the same terms as if such Mass Arbitration Disputes had been filed and accepted as part of the Initial Batch. The delay in the acceptance of a Mass Arbitration Dispute under this provision shall be excluded when calculating the relevant time limit to bring a Dispute under this Arbitration Agreement. Take-Two and the party to any Mass Arbitration Dispute that would otherwise be delayed under this provision may agree to waive the delay and include such Mass Arbitration Dispute in the Initial Batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith to implement this batch-based process.

Severability for Mass Arbitration. If any court or arbitrator determines that this Section 15.5(9) is void or unenforceable for any reason, or if New Era declines to administer any Mass Arbitration Dispute as a Mass Arbitration, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and you and Take-Two shall be deemed not to have agreed to arbitrate such Disputes.

**(10) Exclusion from Arbitration.** Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through binding individual arbitration, you and Take-Two may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts any of the following claims: patent infringement or invalidity; copyright infringement (including, without limitation, based on use of the Services following a breach of, or termination of rights under, the Agreement); moral rights violations; trademark infringement; trade secret misappropriation; or computer fraud and abuse. Either party to a Dispute may seek relief in a small claims court for any individual Disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction, including by seeking to have an arbitration pending under this Arbitration Agreement moved to such small claims court on this basis.

**(11) Limitation on Changes to Arbitration Provision.** We may update this Agreement, including the Arbitration Agreement, at our discretion in accordance with Section 1.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, if Take-Two changes any of the terms of this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first accepted the Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Arbitration Agreement), you may reject the new changes. To reject the new changes to the Arbitration Agreement, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the effective date of the changes you seek to reject, as indicated by the “Last Updated” date above. Your rejection notice must be sent to:

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT — REJECTION OF CHANGES TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

110 West 44th Street,

New York, New York, 10036

The rejection notice must include (1) your full name; (2) your mailing address; (3) your user account name, if you have one; and (4) a clear, signed statement that you reject the changes to this Arbitration Agreement. For clarity, if you previously accepted the Arbitration Agreement, your rejection of changes to the Arbitration Agreement does not mean that you opt out; you and Take-Two will still arbitrate any Dispute between you and Take-Two under the terms of the Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed or the effective date of the last version of the Arbitration Agreement you accepted (as indicated by the “Last Updated” date above), whichever is later.

**(12) Severability.** Except as set forth in Sections 15.5(2) and (9), if any clause within this Arbitration Agreement is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, that clause or portion will be severed, and the remainder of this Dispute Resolution section will be given full force and effect.
