==============

Last revised on: June 5, 2024

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. At Circleboom, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

Information Circleboom Gather and Tracks
----------------------------------------

##### Circleboom gathers three types of information about users:

* Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate feedback forums and from participation in competitions and surveys:
* Information Circleboom gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views and actions performed throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our features to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience.
* Information collected from third party services for which you provide Circleboom with Twitter API access credentials. Information collected from these services will be used to provide you with functionality visible on Circleboom. We may also utilize this data in to produce aggregate reports such as infographics or to produce additional value added information such as influence ranking to the public.

##### Circleboom Gathers User Information in The Following Processes:

* Electronic newsletters policy  
    We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Circleboom gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page.
* Feedback forums  
    Users of the site's Feedback Forums must register separately for this service in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.
* Twitter  
    User who connect their Twitter account with Circleboom should be aware that this provide us with full access via Twitter's API to the details contained in your Twitter account. This includes, but is not limited to; your entire tweet stream, all of your friends and followers, your account settings and your account details. This does not include your Direct Messages or password.  
      
    Circleboom will use this API access to provide you with the functionality on our website. We will collect information from this API about your social graph to provide you with unfollow tools. We will collect information from this API about your Tweet stream to provide Tweet related tools.  
      
    Circleboom may republish public information you provide in another public forum. This includes information about your Twitter account to provide influence ranking tools. We will never republish private information publicly and will always abide by Twitter's rules regarding Third Party Developers.  
      
    You can, at any time, revoke Circleboom's access to your Twitter account from your settings page on Twitter. You can also contact us and request we remove any information we have cached about you.  
      
    
* Google  
    Circleboom’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.
* Competitions  
    We may offer optional voluntary competitions where we will collect explicit information which you provide. If you are currently logged into Circleboom we may track your entry to the competition with its connection to the Circleboom account.
* Surveys  
    Circleboom may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.
* Children  
    Consistent with the United State Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. In order to use Circleboom, users must have a valid Twitter account.
* Usage tracking  
    Circleboom tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Circleboom does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).  
      
    Circleboom sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
* Cookies  
    We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Circleboom uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.  
      
    You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do need cookies in order to use most of the functionality on this site.

Use of Information
------------------

Circleboom uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Circleboom never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. Circleboom creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We may also disclose information about any individual user to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
