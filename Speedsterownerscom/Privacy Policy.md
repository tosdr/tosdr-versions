Terms Of Service / Privacy Policy / Data Deletion Instructions
==============================================================

**PRIVACY POLICY**

This policy may be amended from time to time.  
The data we collect and what we do with it.

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to all products, services, and websites operated by IDIDTHAT, LLC. and its related entities, including SpeedsterOwners.com / SpyderOwners.com ("SpeedsterOwners", "we", "us", "our"), when you:

* Visit websites that display or link to this Policy;
* Receive communications from us, including emails phone calls, or texts; and
* Enter into service agreements/subscriptions.

Our host Crowdstack, Inc (Crowdstack) complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield. Crowdstack has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Crowdstack’s certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov.

Collectively, we refer to the EU-U.S Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as the "Principles".

**INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT**

**Information That You Provide Us:** When you sign up for any account or service operated by us, we store all information that you provide to us. This may include personal information like email addresses, your name, passwords, phone numbers, birth date, gender, and address information. For services that require payment, we also collect credit card information, which is stored in encrypted form on secure servers, including PCI-compliant third-party vendors.

If you register and grant access to a third party social network (e.g., Facebook) or integrated service (e.g., Google), we will collect the personal information directly associated with those accounts. This includes your name, email address and the unique identifier provided by the service. The information collected from these third parties will be managed in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Browser Cookies:** When you use one of our services, we may store certain information in browser cookies. These cookies identify your browser and allow us to enhance your online experience. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies, but you may change your browser's settings so that you are informed every time a cookie is set, or to prevent cookies from being set at all. Please note, however, that many of our services do not function properly if cookies are disabled. Advertisers or other third parties do not have access to our cookies. However, such advertisers may set their own cookies. Such cookies are subject to the advertisers' own privacy policies, not this Policy.

**Analytics:** On sites that we own (e.g. crowdstack.com), we track overall usage and traffic on our own sites, including page views, visits, IP addresses, and traffic sources, using third party services like Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to track usage and traffic on an aggregated basis, including page views, visits, and traffic sources.

**Visit Information Via Server Logs:** We record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and page request.

**User Communications:** Any email or written correspondence that you send us may be stored.

**Transaction Records:** Data from any monetary transaction taking place via our service may be stored.

**USES OF COLLECTED INFORMATION (Purpose of Processing)**

We use collected information to enhance your experience online, authenticate you when you sign in, send notifications, fulfill your requests for services, contact you, customize the advertising or content that you see, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

**Do Not Track Notice**: We do not track your activity between sites using our services, or from one of our sites to another; therefore "do not track" requests are not applicable for our platforms and services. If you are on a site hosted by us that is serving third party ads, that particular ad partner is responsible for its response to your browser's Do Not Track request.

**Information Sharing:** We do not share personal information with other individuals, organizations, or companies outside of our company and its related entities, unless we have your consent or unless:

* We are working with trusted partners who agree to abide by the rules of this Policy or have signed a confidentiality agreement.
* We are transmitting data in order to fulfill a service. For instance, credit card transactions are routed through transaction processing firms.
* We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, in response to a lawful request by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
* We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
* If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets that does not involve a related entity, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Note that we may share certain aggregated, non-personal information, such as demographic information, browser type, and usage statistics. In such cases, the information does not identify you personally.

While we do not provide any personal information to advertisers, it is possible that, if you view a certain ad, it may have been delivered to you based on targeting demographic criteria (for example, men who are between 18-24 years of age). Please note that in such situations, the advertiser does not know any specific personal information about you. You understand, however, that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet its particular targeting criteria. We may also share conversion data with advertisers.

**DATA INTEGRITY**

We process personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected, and in accordance with the Principles. We review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the personal information needed.

**DATA DELETION INSTRUCTIONS**

No part of this work may be reproduced or copied in any form or by any means -- graphic, electronic, or mechanical, including photocopying, taping, or information storage and retrieval systems -- without the prior written permission of SpeedsterOwners.com/SpyderOwners.com.

**DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE**

SpeedsterOwners.com/SpyderOwners.com currently provides users with access to a collection of on-line resources, including web file space for automotive and hobby related content (the "Service").  
  
You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on this site. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.  
  
However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use this content. Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our site, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content.

In consideration of use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.

**SPAM / DAMAGES**

SpeedsterOwners.com/SpyderOwners.com will immediately terminate any account which it believes, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk email.

**MEMBER CONDUCT**

You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.

SpeedsterOwners.com/SpyderOwners.com does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, objectionable or incorrect. SpeedsterOwners.com/SpyderOwners.com may suspend or terminate your account at it's sole discretion.

However, this restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.
