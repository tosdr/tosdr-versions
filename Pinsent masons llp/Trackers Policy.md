Cookie Policy
=============

Our website uses a number of cookies for a number of reasons. We explain these in this policy. Before we can use some - but not all - of these cookies, we need your consent.

You may alter your consent preferences - including to withdraw consent to non-essential cookies which you have previously given - at any time by moving the on/off toggles below, or by clicking 'Reject all non-essential cookies' to reject all optional cookies.  Any selections you make will be automatically saved and you may navigate away from the Cookie Policy.

### Your cookie settings

#### Essential cookies

These are used to operate the core functions of our website, so that you may visit and move around it, and use its features. We do not require your consent to use these cookies. [More information](#ESS)

#### Experience enhancing cookies

At present, we do not use these types of cookies. Choosing to 'Allow all cookies' or moving this toggle to 'on' will have no impact. If we wish to use these types of cookies in the future, we will provide details of the cookies so that you can make an informed choice as to whether you consent to our use of them at that time. [More information](#EPC)

#### Analytics cookies

These help us to understand how visitors use and move around our website, which inform improvements and adaptions to our website. Rejecting these cookies prevents us from collecting such data. The performance of our site will not be affected. [More information](#AC)

#### Advertising cookies

These provide us with anonymised demographics and browsing activity information, and help us tailor and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on different sites. Rejecting these prevents us from relating your visits to our website to our social media and other marketing campaigns and prevents social media sites and our digital marketing partners from setting cookies on your device via pinsentmasons.com.

If you have any queries concerning our use of your personal information, please email [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please also visit our [Privacy Policy](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices/privacy-policy), which explains how we collect your personal information, what we do with it and your rights in respect of it.

1\. What are cookies?
---------------------

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Software on your device, for example a web browser, stores the cookies and sends them back to a website next time you visit. Cookies allow websites to recognise your device and preferences, and provide information to the owners of sites which can be used to improve your online experience.

You can find more information about cookies and similar technologies at [www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/).

2\. The types of cookies that we use
------------------------------------

This section sets out information about the cookie technology that we use on our site for which we are responsible. Where 'personal data' is processed by these cookies, Pinsent Masons LLP is the 'data controller' of that information, within the meaning of applicable data protection legislation. For an explanation of the meaning of these and other data protection legislation terms, and for comprehensive information about our responsibilities when handling personal data - including transfers of personal data across the Pinsent Masons business worldwide - and your rights in respect of any personal information of yours that we process, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices/privacy-policy).

Third party providers of the cookie technology that we use may process data collected by the cookies on our site, in an aggregated form, for their own purposes. If this is the case in respect of any of the third party cookie providers that we use, we have indicated as much in the tables set out in this section.

### Basic performance – 'necessary' or 'essential' cookies

We use essential cookies to operate the core functions of our website, so that you may visit and move around it, and use its features. We do not require your consent to use these cookies but you may be able to block these cookies yourself on your device/browser (see section 4 of this Policy). However, without these cookies, our site is unlikely to work as you would expect and certain services that you may ask for, for example, signing into your online account, cannot be provided.

Where we process 'personal data' using these essential cookies, we do so on the basis of our legitimate interests to provide a website for visitors to use and to promote our business.

* [### More information about our use of essential cookies](#)
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | Purpose of essential cookies | The essential cookies that we use on our website are technically necessary for the site to function properly.<br><br>For example, essential cookies are required so that you can log into your account, set your preferences and complete forms. They remember you and your settings, and save you having to retype information when navigating between pages. They ensure our pages load quickly by distributing the workload. Essential cookies are also necessary for our site to distinguish between browsers, differentiate users behind a shared IP address so as to deliver correct content, and to recognise trusted traffic and apply security settings. |
    | Data processed by essential cookies | When you navigate to and around our website our essential cookies collect your session ID, a time stamp of your visit and log in, and session verification data. Our essential cookies may also collect information about your browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system and mobile network. |
    | Recipients | We process data collected by essential cookies on our own servers. Data collected by certain essential cookies may be collected, in aggregate form only from which no one visitor to our site can be identified or distinguished from another, by our third party essential cookie providers such as Sitecore, for their own purposes. |
    | Transfers | Our global presence means that your personal information may be transferred across the business worldwide due, for example, to our shared IT systems and datacentres, and cross-border working practices. For more information about such transfers across our business please see section 3 of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices/privacy-policy). |
    | Duration | Certain of our essential cookies are session cookies, meaning they expire once you exit your session and close your browser.<br><br>Other of our essential cookies may last for six months or longer, for example to remember your cookie preferences for this period and to recognise trusted traffic, or for as long as you retain an online account with us. |
    

### Help us to improve – 'analytics' cookies

Analytics cookies are used by us for statistical analysis purposes. This helps us to understand how visitors use and move around our website, which inform improvements and adaptions to our website to best meet our visitors' needs by, for example, making the most popular features the easiest to find and access or ensuring that our site works properly on the devices and technologies that our visitors use.

These cookies work by using a distinctive sequence of characters from which your browser or device can be identified ('unique ID'), which, for example, can be used by us to recognise the date and time of your visit(s) to our site. Our analytics cookies may also collect information about your browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system and mobile network. This information is used to distinguish you from other visitors to our site, but it cannot be used to identify you as a named individual.

We will only set these types of cookies where you have provided us with your consent to do so by either choosing to 'Allow all cookies' or by adjusting your cookie settings via the ['Your cookies settings'](#CS), above. Where we process your personal information using these types of cookies, we do so on the basis of that consent.

Rejecting our analytics cookies will prevent us from collecting the data described above to improve our site for you and other visitors. The performance and functionality of our site will not be affected.

    #### Google Analytics
    
    Google Analytics is a widely used platform for measuring the performance of a website. It helps us to understand things like what our visitors are reading and what technology (e.g. browsers) we should prioritise for testing. This information is used to help us give you the best possible experience – more of what you want, and less of what you don’t.
    
    We process the data collected by these Google Analytics cookies. Google Analytics may provide us with technical support. Data may be collected - in aggregate form only from which no one visitor to our site can be identified or distinguished from another - by Google Analytics to help improve Google Analytics' products and services.
    
    Rejecting analytic cookies will prevent us from using Google Analytics cookies to collect data about your visit(s) to our site, which would be used by us in aggregation with other visitors' data to understand visitors' behaviour and how many visits are made to our site. This will not affect any consent to the use of Google Analytics cookies that you may give to other websites.
    
    | Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | \_ga | To distinguish users. | 2 years |
    | \_ga\_<container-id> | Used to persist session state. | 2 years |
    
    #### Sitecore Analytics
    
    Sitecore is the content management system on which our website sits.
    
    The Sitecore cookie that we use serves a similar purpose to Google Analytics cookies. It is used to measure the performance of our website and help us to improve the experience of visitors.
    
    We process the data collected by the Sitecore Analytics cookie. Sitecore Analytics may provide us with technical support. Data may be collected - in aggregate form only from which no one visitor to our site can be identified or distinguished from another - by Sitecore Analytics for its own purposes.
    
    Rejecting analytics cookies will prevent us from tracking your visit to Pinsentmasons.com using Sitecore technology. This will not affect any consent to the use of Sitecore cookies that you may give to other websites.
    
    | Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | SC\_ANALYTICS\_GLOBAL\_COOKIE | This stores an ID that represents the device (issued by Sitecore) and a true/false value indicating whether visitor classification was guessed (robot or not robot). Used by the tracker to [identify a returning contact](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/93/sitecore-experience-platform/en/tracking-contacts.html). | 2 years |
    

### Advertising cookies

We have configured the advertising plug-ins on our website to only set cookies on devices used by logged-in members of those advertisers, e.g. social media platforms. For example, we may advertise the services that we provide and job opportunities on certain third party websites such as LinkedIn. We use cookies from those third parties' sites on our own website to:

* provide us with anonymised demographics and browsing activity information of the logged-in visitors to our own website;
* help us to tailor our advertising on the websites of those third parties to previous logged-in visitors to certain pages of our own site; and
* help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

These cookies work by using a distinctive sequence of characters from which your browser or device can be identified ('unique ID'). Social media and other advertising cookies may also collect information about your browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system and mobile network. This information is used to distinguish you from other visitors to our site, but it cannot be used to identify you as a named individual.

We will only set these types of cookies where you have provided us with your consent to do so by either choosing to 'Allow all cookies' or by adjusting your cookie settings via the ['Your cookies settings'](#CS), above. Where we process your personal information using these types of cookies, we do so on the basis of that consent.

Rejecting these cookies will prevent us from relating your visits to our various marketing campaigns. It will also prevent any cookies that you have given consent for LinkedIn and/or other advertisers to use to better understand your browsing behaviour to be stored on your device via pinsentmasons.com.

* [### The advertising cookies that we use](#)
    
    #### LinkedIn
    
    These cookies help us understand the performance of any advertising we do on the LinkedIn platform. They also allow us to deliver adverts to people who are likely to be interested in them (based on what they have read on our website). For example, we might promote the new version of an annual report to those who read the previous year's report.
    
    We process the data collected by these LinkedIn cookies. LinkedIn may provide us with technical support. Data may be collected - in aggregate form only from which no one visitor to our site can be identified or distinguished from another - by LinkedIn for its own purposes.

3\. Note on 'Experience Enhancing' cookies   
---------------------------------------------

At present, we do not use experiencing enhancing cookies. Experiencing enhancing cookies would allow us to tailor content for you, for example to make our site and information displayed on it more relevant to your interests.

Choosing to 'Allow all cookies' or moving the on/off toggle for 'Experience enhancing' to 'on' in your 'Manage my cookies' preference centre will have no impact at this time. We have included this section and consent toggle functionality as we anticipate that in the future we may wish to use these types of cookies with your consent. _**If we wish to process your personal information using these types of cookies in the future, we will do so on the basis of your informed consent at that time.**_ This means that we will provide details of the cookies so that you can make an informed choice as to whether you consent to our use of them.

4\. Cookie set by third parties 
--------------------------------

'Third party cookies' are cookies set by a domain other than the one that you are visiting. When you visit our website, third party organisations may place cookies on your browser, even if you are not a logged-in member of those organisations. This is because third party cookies do not require you to actively engage with the third party's content or visit their site, just load a page on which the third party's technology sits. For example, we use third party technologies such as video and audio hosting platforms to enable you to watch videos and listen to podcasts on our website. The providers of these technologies may deploy cookies to your browser when you visit the pages on our site where we are using their technologies.

These cookies may inform the third party organisations about your visit to our site which may be used by those organisations to deliver targeted messages and advertising to you. In all cases, we do not set these cookies and we have no access to the information that they gather. Such cookies are subject to the third party organisations' own cookie policies.
