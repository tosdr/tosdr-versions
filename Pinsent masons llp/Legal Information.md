Privacy Policy
--------------

Pinsent Masons may use your personal information together with other information for providing legal services, credit checks, anti- money laundering, marketing, administration and training, and we may disclose information to our service providers and agents for these purposes. We take the privacy and security of your information seriously. Worldwide we follow a global privacy policy and we will only use such personal information as set out in this privacy policy. For further information, see a full copy of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices/privacy-policy). 

Anti-Money Laundering Policies and Procedures
---------------------------------------------

Before accepting any new instruction, we will ask for information about the potential client and the nature of the proposed work for the purpose of conflict checking, credit checking, client verification procedures and other bona fide purposes. Please note that, to assist in fulfilling our professional and regulatory obligations, this information (which may include personal data) may be shared with any Pinsent Masons affiliated entity for such purposes. Any personal data received in order to comply with our anti-money laundering obligations will only be processed for the purpose of preventing money laundering, terrorist financing or proliferation financing unless such processing is permitted by law, or any other purposes to which you have consented. 

When first taking your instructions, we are required to identify both our client and (if relevant) the ultimate beneficial owner of our client, and to verify that identity in a number of ways.  We may need your assistance to satisfy these requirements.  Without compliance with these obligations, we will not be able to act for you.

It is our policy that the requirements for identifying and verifying a client's identity which are in force in the UK, shall also apply in our offices outside the UK unless local laws impose higher requirements, in which event we shall apply those higher standards. For further information, see [Anti-Money Laundering](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices/money-laundering).

    #### Financial Regulation
    
    We are not authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, nor are we regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. If, while we are acting for you, you need advice on investments, we may have to refer you to someone who is authorised to provide the necessary advice. However, we may provide certain limited investment advice services where these are closely linked to the legal work we are doing for you. This is because we are members of the Law Society of England and Wales, which is a designated professional body for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
    
    The Solicitors Regulation Authority is the independent regulatory arm of the Law Society. The Legal Ombudsman provides an independent complaints review process for most clients of solicitors’ firms. If you are unhappy with any investment advice you receive from us, you should raise your concerns with either of these bodies.
    
    #### Insurance Distribution
    
    We are not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. However, we are included on the register maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority so that we may carry on insurance distribution activity, which is broadly the advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of our business, including arrangements for complaints or redress if something goes wrong, is regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The register can be accessed via the Financial Conduct website: [https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register](https://www.fca.org.uk/register)
    
    In relation to insurance distribution activities please note that we operate as an ancillary insurance intermediary and that we do not develop or manufacture insurance products. We are required to inform you that we act for you as our client in this regard and not the insurers.
    
    If you are unhappy with any insurance advice you receive from us, you should raise your concerns with either the Solicitors Regulation Authority or the Legal Ombudsman.
    
    All requests for further information or any client complaints about Pinsent Masons LLP (including complaints concerning our fees and charges) should be addressed in the first instance with your client partner, failing which, they should be addressed to the Senior Partner of Pinsent Masons LLP at 30 Crown Place, London, EC2A 4ES, United Kingdom.
    
    If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint, then you may be entitled to ask the Legal Ombudsman of England and Wales to consider the complaint. A complaint to the Legal Ombudsman must normally be made within six months of the date of the conclusion of the Firm's complaints procedure. Details on how to contact the Legal Ombudsman and further information on the procedures involved can be found at [http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk](http://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/). (Note: the Legal Ombudsman can only deal with complaints from members of the public, very small businesses, charities, clubs and trusts).
    
    If you are a consumer (i.e. an individual acting for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside your trade, business, craft or profession) alternative complaint bodies exist which are competent to deal with complaints about legal services should both you and the firm wish to use such a scheme. For further information please refer to our Complaints Policy a copy of which is available on request from [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

    We recognise that Alternative Dispute Resolution Regulations have implemented ADR/EDR Directive 2013/11/EU to promote alternative dispute resolution as a means of redress for consumers in relation to unsatisfactory services. We have however chosen not to adopt an ADR process.
    
    The Client Protection Fund (the operating name of the Scottish Solicitors' Guarantee Fund) is a fund established by Section 43 of the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980 to protect clients who have lost money because of the dishonesty of a solicitor or a member of their staff. The Client Protection Fund is a fund of last resort and in most cases will only compensate those who have tried all other options to recover their losses. The Guarantee Fund is controlled and managed by the Law Society of Scotland. For details see: [https://www.lawscot.org.uk/for-the-public/client-protection/client-protection-fund/](https://www.lawscot.org.uk/for-the-public/client-protection/client-protection-fund/).
