Privacy Policy
==============

Last updated: October 2024 

1.  Introduction
----------------

As a global professional services business with law at its core, we are committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of the personal information in our care.  This policy explains how we collect your personal information, what we do with it and your rights in respect of it.  We have a separate policy which sets out similar information relating to the cookies that we use, which can be found [here](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices/cookie-settings).

When we say 'we', 'our', 'us' or 'Pinsent Masons' in this policy, we are referring to all or any of the entities which make up the international Pinsent Masons group, as the context requires.  An explanation of some of the other terminology that we use in this policy is set out in section 11.

2.  Who and where we are
------------------------

Pinsent Masons provides legal and other professional services globally via a number of entities.  These include Pinsent Masons LLP, its subsidiaries and any affiliates which practise under the name Pinsent Masons, or which Pinsent Masons LLP or its partners operate as separate businesses, e.g. Out-Law, Vario and MPillay.  

For country specific information about our business, including a list of our offices and the jurisdictions in which we operate, please click [here](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/legal-notices). 

Our global reach means that we are subject to the differing data protection regimes of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  We strive to achieve uniformity of data protection practices across the Pinsent Masons group, whilst also complying with all data protection laws.  This policy reflects the EU GDPR standard of protection of personal information and references the relevant Articles of the EU GDPR where appropriate.  In those jurisdictions where data protection regimes differ significantly to the EU GDPR, elements of this policy may not apply, for example individuals' rights in relation to their personal information, and this policy does not establish rights or obligations which are additional to those prescribed in the applicable local data protection law.

### 2.1 Data Controller

We are the data controller of the personal information that we process, i.e. the organisation which determines, alone or jointly with another party, how your personal information is processed and for what purposes.  This means that we are legally responsible for ensuring our systems, processes, suppliers and people comply with data protection laws in relation to the personal information that we handle. 

Most of Pinsent Masons' main IT systems are located in the UK or EU and controlled by Pinsent Masons LLP.  Much of Pinsent Masons’ internal business operations are also centralised in the UK, operating out of Pinsent Masons LLP to support the business globally.  Pinsent Masons LLP is the data controller of personal data processed for these centralised services.  However, depending on the jurisdiction from which our legal or other services are provided to you, or in which your personal information is otherwise processed by us, Pinsent Masons LLP or another entity in the Pinsent Masons group may be the data controller in respect of your personal information. 

Where we transfer your personal data to third parties, in certain circumstances those third parties may also be data controllers.  More information about this is provided in the 'Disclosure' sections of the tables in section 5 of this policy.

### 2.2 Contacting us

We want to offer you a means of contacting the right people in our organisation as swiftly and easily as possible. We therefore have in place dedicated email addresses, which are managed by our team of Privacy specialists, who support our global network on Privacy matters. 

You may contact our Privacy specialists with any questions about this policy, or our Privacy practices more generally at [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You have rights in respect of the personal information of yours in our care.  More information about these rights is set out in section 8 of this policy.  You may exercise your rights by emailing our Privacy specialists at [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Whilst our team of Privacy specialists operate through our centralised business operations in the UK, for which Pinsent Masons LLP is the data controller, the team works closely with information law and data protection specialists working from PM offices across our global network.  As such, our dedicated email addresses have global reach, and your communications are directed to the appropriate data controller within the Pinsent Masons group, as appropriate. 

You are of course welcome to contact any of our offices directly (relevant contact information is found [here](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/office-finder)). In addition, we have a dedicated email address for Privacy matters relating to our operations in South Africa: [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).  (Please also see section 13.1 of this policy for more information about how we comply with applicable data protection law in South Africa.) 

3.  Transfers of personal information across our business and to our suppliers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our global presence means that your personal information may be transferred across the business worldwide due, for example, to our shared IT systems and datacentres, and cross-border working practices.  Personal data transfers are facilitated across the Pinsent Masons group by way of an intra group agreement which applies contractual protections and other appropriate safeguards required under applicable data protection law to all such transfers of personal data within the Pinsent Masons group.  Such contractual protections include obligations on PM entities outside the EU and UK to resist and challenge demands for data made by local government agencies, to the extent possible.

We also use a number of suppliers and service providers in connection with the operation of our business who may have access to the personal information that we process, e.g. IT suppliers when providing us with software support or cloud services, or a company which we use for a marketing campaign when processing your contact information on our behalf.  In all cases, your personal information is handled and protected in accordance with applicable data protection law.  Where we use cloud services, our data will generally be hosted within the UK or EU, those being the locations which offer the highest level of data protection regulation of all the regions in which we operate.  Where any personal data is processed by suppliers outside the EEA in countries that the UK and/or the EU have not assessed as providing an adequate level of data protection, we ensure that personal data is adequately protected in accordance with applicable data protection law, and in particular Article 46 of the UK GDPR and the EU GDPR, by ensuring information security and other appropriate safeguards are in place, and using approved model contract clauses to cover the transfer or by ensuring that the supplier has Binding Corporate Rules in place.

4.  Whose personal information do we process?
---------------------------------------------

We collect and process the personal information:

5\.  How do we process your personal information?
-------------------------------------------------

We will only process your personal information where we are permitted to do so by law, meaning when we have one or more legal basis to do so.  The following subsections explain how we process your personal information depending on the context of how personal information typically comes into our care, and include further information about the legal basis or bases that we rely on in those circumstances. 

In certain circumstances, we rely on the legal ground known as 'legitimate interests' to process your personal information.  This is where the processing of your personal information is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which is reasonably expected as part of running our business, but which is not detrimental to you and would have minimal impact on your privacy.  We undertake an assessment of any potential impact on your privacy before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests.

Insofar as we wish to use your personal information for purposes other than those mentioned above, we will check whether these additional purposes are compatible with the original purposes within the meaning of Article 6(4) of the EU GDPR.  Depending on the circumstances, we will inform you about the change of purpose and obtain your consent for the further processing of your personal information.

If you would like more details about the specific legal basis we are relying on to process your personal information where more than one legal basis has been set out in the relevant subsection below, please email us as at [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

6\. Our Use of New and Novel Technologies
-----------------------------------------

We strive to be at the forefront of innovation, both when providing legal services to our clients, as well as ensuring that our back-office processes are as efficient and cost-effective as possible. To this end, we may occasionally adopt new technology tools and develop innovative digital solutions of our own. Such tools may leverage artificial intelligence or cloud-based technologies owned by third parties. 

New technology tools may be used for the following purposes:

* To automate repetitive tasks;
* To assist with our anti-money laundering (AML) and know your client (KYC) procedures;
* To help manage emails, meetings and tasks;
* To assist with reviews of large volumes of documents;
* To generate machine translations; and
* To develop, test and train the tools themselves.

Prior to the adoption of any tool which takes advantage of artificial intelligence or cloud-based functionality, we conduct an extensive due diligence process in line with industry best practice, including with reference to our internal data privacy policies and security certifications. This ensures that confidentiality, security and the transparent, ethical use of new technologies are always prioritised. Where such tools are used as part of the provision of legal services to our clients, any outputs they generate will be vetted by appropriately-qualified and experienced members of our fee-earning team. Where necessary, we will seek client consent for the use of any tool which is used for client work outside of our normal business operations.

7.  For how long do we keep your information?
---------------------------------------------

Your personal information is retained by us in accordance with applicable law and regulation.   Our data retention periods vary depending on the location, nature and context of the personal information that we have in our care, and are calculated taking into account the following factors:

* potential claims or litigation;
* guidance from official bodies such as relevant data protection supervisory authorities and professional regulatory bodies;
* how long we need to keep the data to fulfil the original purpose for which it was collected;
* the nature and sensitivity of personal data; and
* legal obligations to which we are subject.

This means that, in general, we delete personal information when: the purpose for its processing has been fulfilled or the contractual relationship with our client, you or your company has ended; all mutual claims have been fulfilled; and there are no other legal obligations to retain the personal information nor legal bases for further processing.  Typically, we retain personal information in client files for 10 years after the completion of the matter, unless there are specific circumstances compelling us to retain the client files for a longer period.

More information about your rights in respect of the personal information of yours in our care, including how to contact us to exercise these or with questions around our retention practices in respect of your personal information, is set out in section 8 of this Policy.

14\. Our personnel vetting practices in respect of criminal offences
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Criminal offence information may be requested of prospective PM people and prospective Varios as part of our UK recruitment processes before an offer of employment is made unconditional.  This practice is limited to our UK operations.  This Privacy Policy is regularly reviewed and updated, and should our practice of requesting criminal offence information of prospective PM people and prospective Varios for certain roles expand outside the UK, we will tell you here.  Our vetting practices are carried out always in accordance with applicable law.

If we are not permitted to or are not justified in seeking information about criminal offences for a role, we will not ask candidates for criminal offence information. We will not seek criminal offence information from any source other than the individual concerned, a criminal record bureau or a checking organisation.

Criminal offence information will only ever be used by the firm for the purposes for which it was originally collected. Criminal record certificate information will be handled, kept, and disposed of in accordance with the firm's Pre-employment Checks Policy: candidates may email [\[email protected\]](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to request a copy.

### Recruitment of ex-offenders policy statement

We are committed to the fair treatment of our people, prospective PM people and users of our services, regardless of their offending background.

The firm promotes equality of opportunity for all with the right mix of talent, skills and potential. Having a criminal record will not necessarily bar an individual from working with us and we welcome applications from a wide range of candidates, including those with criminal records.

The firm selects all candidates for interview based on their skills, qualifications and experience.

### Circumstances in which candidates may be asked to provide criminal offence information

A criminal record check or a request for criminal offence information from an individual is only requested after a thorough risk assessment has indicated that doing so is both proportionate and relevant to the position concerned.

The type of criminal records information and level of criminal record check that the firm is entitled to request will depend on the nature of the role for which the individual's suitability is being assessed. When recruiting for a role, we assess whether:

* it is appropriate to limit the criminal offence information sought to offences that have a direct bearing on suitability for the job in question; and
* the information provided should be verified with a criminal record bureau.

### If candidates are asked to provide criminal offence information

Where we request criminal offence information from an individual but do not request a criminal record check, we will ask the individual to provide only criminal offence information in relation to convictions and cautions that the firm would be legally entitled to see in a criminal record check for the relevant role.

If it is assessed that we should verify criminal records information with a criminal record check, we will comply with any criminal record bureau code of practice to which we are subject and provide the individual concerned with a copy of the firm's Pre-employment Checks Policy.

The firm will not rely on previously-issued criminal record certificates.

### Criminal offence information verified through a criminal record check

Once criminal offence information has been verified through a criminal record check, we will:

* if inconsistencies emerge between the information provided by the individual and the information in the criminal record certificate, give the individual the opportunity to provide an explanation; and
* record that a criminal record check was completed and whether it yielded a satisfactory or unsatisfactory result.

### Where an unprotected conviction or caution is disclosed

If we have concerns about the information that has been disclosed by a criminal record bureau, or the information is not as expected, we will discuss our concerns with the candidate and carry out a risk assessment.

Our risk assessment will take into account the circumstances and background of any offences and whether they are relevant to the position in question, balancing the rights and interests of the individual, PM people, clients, suppliers and the public.

We treat all applicants fairly but reserve the right to withdraw an offer of employment if an individual does not disclose relevant information, or if a criminal bureau check reveals information which we reasonably believe would make an individual unsuitable for a role.

### Disputing the content of a criminal record certificate

Individuals may raise a dispute with a criminal record bureau if they believe that there has been a mistake in the contents of their certificate, for example a mistake in:

* the records provided, for example incorrect or irrelevant information on convictions; or
* their personal details.

Dispute processes may vary by criminal record bureau and the relevant criminal record bureau should be contacted directly for guidance on how to raise a dispute.
