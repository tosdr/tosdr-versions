Terms and Conditions
====================

The Unlock Surveys Community (the "**Community**") and the [www.unlocksurveys.com](http://www.unlocksurveys.com/) website (the "**Website**") are operated by Maru Group Canada Inc. ("**MARU**" or "**we**"). By joining the Community and becoming a Community member (a "**Member**") or by using the Website, you agree to be bound by the following terms & conditions (the "**Terms**"):

Registration Requirements
-------------------------

In order to receive invitations to participate in Community surveys you must first register as a Member of the Community by providing us with accurate, complete and updated registration information as required by the profiling survey. The profiling survey will ask you questions about your residence, age, your habits and attitudes, family status, gender, education level and so on.

To ensure the integrity of the Community, you may not (i) activate or use more than one Member profile account; (ii) use a name subject to rights of another person without authorization from that person; (iii) use a false or misleading name, address, or email address to activate or use an account; or (iv) provide any false or misleading information. If we have reason to believe that you have violated any of these provisions, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to use of and/or participation in the community.

We are in the business of researching and reporting on public opinion on a wide variety of issues, from politics to consumer products. Any personal information we collect remains confidential and is used for research purposes only, as set out in our corporate Privacy Policy available here: [https://www.unlocksurveys.com/static/privacy](https://www.unlocksurveys.com/static/privacy)  
You are responsible for all usage or activity on your account, including use of the account by any third party (which is prohibited), whether or not such use is authorized by you or is the result of you authorizing a third party to use your username and password.

Membership in the Community is open only to persons residing in the 50 states of the United States or the District of Columbia and who are 14 years of age or older. Employees of MARU, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and members of their immediate family are not eligible to participate.

At any time, you may update your email address and/or other registration information by visiting the Update Profile section of the Website and entering the information requested. You may also terminate your participation at any time by sending an email with the subject line "remove me" to [support@unlocksurveys.com](mailto:support@unlocksurveys.com)

Community Participation
-----------------------

As a Member, you must be willing to participate in at least one survey per quarter (3 months). Your participation is completely voluntary, and there is no obligation for you to participate in every survey we conduct. However, we reserve the right to terminate your account (including cancelling the points in your account) if you do not complete a survey for more than 3 consecutive months.

Members are invited to participate in surveys based on demographic information or randomly, depending on the survey criteria. We do not guarantee any minimum number of surveys and you acknowledge and agree that we are under no obligation to provide you with a particular number of opportunities to participate in surveys.

Points & Redemption
-------------------

As a reward for completing surveys, you will receive "points" which will be posted to your account within 30 days of the completion of a survey. The number of points received for each survey may vary and will be announced prior to each survey - not all surveys qualify for points.  
From time to time we may offer sweepstakes, with prizes to randomly selected Members, rather than points (in which cases we will clearly identify invitations that provide entry to sweepstakes and provide a direct link to the related sweepstakes rules and regulations).  
Once your account has a minimum balance of at least 2500 points, you may redeem the points by visiting the Website and clicking on 'Redeem Points Now'. Points may be redeemed:  
• for a Paypal transfer, or  
• Virtual & Physical Master Card,  
• many other gift card options (such options are subject to change).

MARU is not responsible for changes to or discontinuance of any third party programs or rewards earned through your participation in the Community. You are responsible for assessing any tax implications that may arise through the point program and for the payment of any applicable taxes. Redeeming points in amounts less than 2500 points is not permitted. Once you redeem points, the number of points redeemed will be deducted from your account.  
Rules governing the method for earning points when a Member participates in special promotions are subject to the specific terms and conditions of the particular promotion, as specified in the terms and conditions for any such promotion.

We reserve the right to suspend, terminate, revalue or modify, without liability or the provision of advance notice to Members, all or part of the points value structure and offers. We further reserve the right to adjudicate all point discrepancies in our sole discretion, and you agree to abide with any such adjudication. We reserve the right to change the Points value structure or other incentives within the recruitment for a study. In the event the point program is terminated, Members will be notified and given at least 2 months in which to redeem their points (above the 2500 point threshold) in accordance with these Terms.

The points are not considered to be property and, as such, may not be sold, transferred, pooled or assigned to or with any other person or account under any circumstances. Points have no monetary value and cannot be used for any purpose other than redeeming them in accordance with these Terms.

We take reasonable care to ensure points are accurately deposited in Members' accounts, however you are responsible for ensuring that your account balance is accurate and we will not be held liable for any errors or omissions concerning points.

BY UTILIZING THE POINTS PROGRAM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MARU IS NOT A BANK OR ANY OTHER KIND OR FORM OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND THAT MARU DOES NOT MAINTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN THOSE SPECIFIED HEREIN. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE "POINTS" CREDITED TO YOUR ACCOUNT ARE NOT ACTUAL CASH DEPOSITS AND ARE ONLY ACCOUNT ENTRIES THAT ENTITLE YOU TO REDEEM THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDITED POINTS IF YOU REDEEM THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY REDEEM THE AMOUNTS IN YOUR ACCOUNT IN THE MANNER AND ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES DESCRIBED IN THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHICH WE MAY AMEND FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.
