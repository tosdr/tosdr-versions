Effective Date: November 15, 2014

[California Privacy Notice](https://www.securerights.org/ccpa.html)

  
SecureRights is a third party verification service dedicated to protecting consumers from fraud and privacy violations. We work with other businesses displaying the SecureRights logo such as the one from whose website you transferred to get to this site (collectively the "Site" or "Company"). We provide a secure platform for these businesses to manage and oversee the collection and transfer of consumer information. SecureRights verifies information submitted through its system by individual consumers seeking information on financial products and services from the businesses that provide them.

  
SecureRights is affiliated with LeadPoint, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Los Angeles, California and maintains an online marketplace that helps match businesses that provide residential mortgages, debt financing and other financial products and services to consumers who have expressed an interest in seeking such products and services. SecureRights is an independent third party verification service that is dedicated to combating fraud and protecting consumer privacy. When consumers seeking financial products and services submit their information through websites prominently displaying the SecureRights logo, we will collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for such products and services. SecureRights also provides a mechanism for consumers to report fraud or violations of their privacy.  
Your privacy is important to us. We understand that in seeking information on a mortgage refinance or other financial product or service you are entrusting us with your personal financial information. We take privacy seriously, and want you to feel comfortable using the Site. This page describes our online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").

This Privacy Policy describes how we use personal information that you submit to us through a website or advertisement displaying the SecureRights logo, how that information is protected, and what safeguards are available to you if you believe that your privacy has been violated or your personal information misappropriated.

By requesting information on our products and services, providing information to us, or otherwise using the Site in any way, you are further indicating your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and our Terms and conditions.

The Site collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to the list herein, which is inclusive of online or offline. (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means) methods. In these methods, the Site may ask an individual to provide various information, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, user behavior, other demographic information and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Personal Information"). Providing information is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Personal Information to the Site.

The personal profile information you submit to the Site remains your property, but by submitting that information to the Site, you grant the Site and its Affiliates, the right to use that information for marketing purposes. The Site may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes.  The Site reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event the Site believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its AUP the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if the Site is sold or acquired, or when the Site deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when the Site, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.  
  
    a. Information Collected from You  
  
        a.i.     Survey Information. Survey information is for the purposes of providing data to the Site to represent to its customers and to assist the Site in improving its experience for its customers.  
        a.ii.     Quote Information. Quote information is for the purposes of providing consumers with quotes for services from service providers including but not limited to various mortgage loans, insurance products, credit card offers and other service offerings.  
        a.iii.     The Site Membership or Registration. To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from the Site, this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from the Site and its partners, whether at our Website or otherwise.  
        a.iv.     "Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for the Site's services, via registration at our website. The Site collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic mailings and website use.  
        a.v.     Requests for Assistance or Service. When an individual requests assistance through the Site€™s customer service department, and when an individual voluntarily subscribes to the Site's service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").  
  
    b. Automated collection of information  
  
The Site currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The Site may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").  
        b.i.     Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The Site to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in the Site 's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.  
        b.ii.     Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows  The Site to track certain website an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The Site might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where shoes are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in The Site's database, visits the shoe website,  The Site receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the shoe the Site, and  The Site would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in shoes.  The Site may thereafter present offers of shoe related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on its and its affiliates web pages,  The Site also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The Site's database.  
        b.iii.     New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The Site's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The Site strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.          
       b.iv.     Usage Tracking and Log Files.  The Site tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.  
        b.v.     IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather information on your proximity to improve the Site experience and to administer The Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.  
        b.vi.     Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective the Sites to this The Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.  
  
    c. Outside Information.
