When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

### Contact forms

We use a WordPress plugin for the contact form on the Contact Page of this website. This plugin does not store any of the sent messages on our webserver or in a database. The message is instead sent to our email inbox at Gmail.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

We use dedicated security software that uses cookies to protect this website from attacks and malicious activity.

Google Analytics uses cookies to better understand how a visitor uses our website (explained in more detail below).

We are an affiliate of Bluehost webhosting and Clickbank and if you click one of our affiliate links then they will use cookies to better understand how a visitor uses their website. If a page on this website contains an affiliate link then that is clearly mentioned early on that page or near the affiliate link itself.

### Mediavine Programmatic Advertising (Ver 1.1)

The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.

First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at [All About Cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.

The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:

* IP Address
* Operating System type
* Operating System version
* Device Type
* Language of the website
* Web browser type
* Email (in hashed form)

Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor’s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.

We use Google Analytics to better understand what people look at one this website.

When someone visits the site then information about their visit such as what pages they looked at, how much time they spent on those pages and what country this visitor is browsing the site from is is sent in an anonymous form to Google Analytics.

This data only contains information about anyone who is browsing our website from your computer and there is no way to identify a specific individual from this data.

We ensure that no personally identifiable information is ever contained within the data sent to Google Analytics.

As analytics information is not personal data, we do not specifically ask for your prior consent.

### Email list addresses

If a visitor consents to joining one of our email lists such as the free to join Positivity Newsletter then they will be sent regular emails containing information about personal development and information about our premium courses. A few of the emails for the Positivity Newsletter contains affiliate links (these are clearly marked as affiliate links within the text).

To join an email list they need to put in their email address into one of the sign up forms on this website, click the “Sign Up” button below the email form and then they will be sent to a page were they will receive more detailed information about the content of the emails they can choose to receive. This page will also display a step-by-step guide for how the visitor can confirm his or her subscription to the email list by clicking a button in an email they have just been sent.

All the email lists on this website (one is free as mentioned above and the rest is connected to our premium course material delivery and course signup availability) are double optin email lists. This means that person subscribing has to click the button in the email that was sent to confirm their subscription. And this procedure is set in place to make sure we get that subscriber’s clear consent to send him or her emails via the email list.

### Order forms

If a visitor joins one of the Positivity Blog premium courses then the payment processing for the course is handled by fastspring.com.

### How we protect your data

We take the security of personal data and this website very seriously.

The data collected is protected in a number of ways:

* **Access control:** The data is only accessed by one person, the owner of this website: Henrik Edberg.
* **Dedicated security software:** We operate dedicated security scanning and access control software on this website. This software limits login attempts to our site, blocks potentially malicious attempts to access our services, and regularly performs full file system scans.
* **Data encryption:** This website is secured with SSL encryption, which means that all traffic to and from our servers is encrypted. This also applies to our own administrative access to the website.
* **Selection of third party service providers:** we use a minimal number of third party service providers, but some are essential for the provision of physical hosting environments and email list services. One of the core factors in the selection of such providers is their ability to provide secure systems and processes.

### What data breach procedures we have in place

As this website is run by one person (Henrik Edberg) are there no internal reports about a potential data breach. Security breaches is regularly scanned for by using dedicated security software and all programs used on this website are always updated to the latest version. If any data breach was to be detected then all other tasks are put on hold and the breach becomes the top priority to handle.

### What third parties we receive data from

We receive data about email list subscribers from Aweber.com that hosts all of our email lists. Such data could for example be what emails a particular and subscribed email address has opened or how long they have been subscribed to that a certain email list.

We can also access limited information about our customers that have joined the premium courses via fastspring.com’s payment processing. That includes information about the name and email address of the customer but not the payment information (this is protected and safely stored by fastspring.com).
