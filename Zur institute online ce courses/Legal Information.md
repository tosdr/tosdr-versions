**Grievance Procedure**
-----------------------

**Zur Institute** is fully committed to conducting all activities in strict conformance with the American Psychological Association’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists. **Zur Institute** will comply with all legal and ethical responsibilities to be non-discriminatory in promotional activities, program content and in the treatment of program participants. The monitoring and assessment of compliance with these standards will be the responsibility of the Director of Operations, in consultation with the Director of **Zur Institute, Glenn Marks, Ph.D.**

While **Zur Institute** goes to great lengths to assure fair treatment for all participants and attempts to anticipate problems, there will be occasional issues which come to the attention of the staff which require intervention and/or action on the part of the staff or the Director of **Zur Institute**. This procedural description serves as a guideline for handling such grievances.

When a participant, either orally or in written format, files a grievance and expects action on the complaint, the following actions will be taken.

1\. If the grievance concerns an author, the content presented by the author, or the style of presentation, the individual filing the grievance will be asked to put his/her comments in written format. The Director of Operations, will then pass on the comments to the author, assuring the confidentiality of the grieved individual.

2\. If the grievance concerns the **Zur Institute** CE program in a specific regard, the Director of Operations, will attempt to arbitrate. Zur Institute’s policy is that the participant is welcome to exchange the course purchased if it does not meet their needs or receive full refund-no questions asked. If the participant would like a refund on a course not completed, they should please send an email to support@zurinstitute.com with that request. We will issue the refund and let the participant know we have done so. NOTE: we can only refund orders within 6 months of the date of purchase.
