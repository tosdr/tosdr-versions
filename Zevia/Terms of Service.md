We encourage you to reach out to us at [privacy@zevia.com](mailto:privacy@zevia.com) if any of your contact details have changed, or if you believe that the information, we hold about you is incorrect. You may have specific rights and choices regarding your personal information under applicable data privacy laws. [Click here](https://www.zevia.com/data-subject-request-form)  to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data privacy laws. These rights may include:

_Access to personal information:_ Under certain state privacy laws and international privacy regulations, you may have the right to confirm that we have collected your personal information and request access to your personal information. In these cases, we will comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).

_Correction and deletion:_ In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal information if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Please note that such a request could be refused because your personal information is required to provide you with the products or services you requested, e.g., to deliver a product or send an invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable law.

We currently do not respond to DNT signals.

Our retention periods vary based on business, legal, and regulatory needs and obligations.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or other legal purpose to process your personal information, we will either delete or deidentify it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

### 9\. DOES ZEVIA TRANSFER MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES?

### 11\. I HAVE ENTERED A CONTEST, PROMOTION OR SURVEY – HOW DO I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT?

Zevia and its preferred third-party service providers or business partners may offer sweepstakes, contests, promotions and surveys (each, a **"Promotion"**).

Where we do this, we will use your personal information as set out in this Policy, or as otherwise notified to you. However, in certain cases, a third party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information that you provide in connection with such Promotion. Before entering any Promotion, we encourage you to check who is operating the Promotion in question, and the terms, conditions, policies and rules that apply to it.

### 12\. HOW OLD DO I HAVE TO BE TO USE THE ZEVIA SITES OR OTHER DIGITAL OFFERINGS?

You must be aged 13 or over to use the Zevia website and our other digital offerings.

We take your privacy very seriously and we understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children who use our products and services. We do not solicit or knowingly collect personal information from children aged 13 and under. If we are made aware that we have received such information, or any information in violation of our Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.

_California Minors:_ If you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: [privacy@zevia.com](mailto:privacy@zevia.com). When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don't follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the content or information. Removal of your personal information from the Services does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.

### 13\. DOES THIS POLICY EVER CHANGE?

We may update or modify this Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. We will obtain your consent to any material Policy changes if and where required by applicable data protection laws. The date of the most recent version of this Policy will appear at the top of the page.

When we update our Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. For example, we will notify you of any changes to this Policy by posting a new Policy and updating the "last modified" date at the top of this page.

_Your Rights and Choices_

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

### A. Right to Access Personal Information and Data Portability Right

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
    
* The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
    
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
    
* The categories of third parties with whom we disclose that personal information.
    
* If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the business purpose for which personal information was disclosed, and the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
    
* The categories of personal information that we sold or shared and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the information
    

You also may request that we inform you of specific pieces of personal information that we collected about you. In some instances, you may request that any of this information be provided to you in an electronically portable format.

### B. Right to Delete

You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. If we cannot delete all of your personal information, we will let you know why.

### C. Right to Correct Inaccurate Information

If you believe that any of the personal information, we hold about you is not accurate, you may submit a request for us to correct that information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the information according to your request.

### D. Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing

You may opt out of the sale of your personal information or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising. To opt out, [click here.](https://www.zevia.com/data-subject-request-form)

### E. Non-Discrimination

You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

### F. Exercising Your Rights

To exercise the access, data portability, correction, opt-out, or deletion rights described above, please submit your request to us:

* [Via webform](https://www.zevia.com/data-subject-request-form); or
    
* Via toll free number at: 855.GO.ZEVIA (855.469.3842)
    

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will reach out to you for additional information as necessary for us to verify your identity. If you are submitting on someone else's behalf, we may ask you and/or your representative for additional verification. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
