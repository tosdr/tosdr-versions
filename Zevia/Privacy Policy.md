We encourage you to reach out to us at [privacy@zevia.com](mailto:privacy@zevia.com) if any of your contact details have changed, or if you believe that the information, we hold about you is incorrect. You may have specific rights and choices regarding your personal information under applicable data privacy laws. [Click here](https://www.zevia.com/data-subject-request-form)  to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data privacy laws. These rights may include:

_Access to personal information:_ Under certain state privacy laws and international privacy regulations, you may have the right to confirm that we have collected your personal information and request access to your personal information. In these cases, we will comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).

_Correction and deletion:_ In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal information if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Please note that such a request could be refused because your personal information is required to provide you with the products or services you requested, e.g., to deliver a product or send an invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable law.

We currently do not respond to DNT signals.

Our retention periods vary based on business, legal, and regulatory needs and obligations.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or other legal purpose to process your personal information, we will either delete or deidentify it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

### 9\. DOES ZEVIA TRANSFER MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES?

### 11\. I HAVE ENTERED A CONTEST, PROMOTION OR SURVEY – HOW DO I FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT?

Zevia and its preferred third-party service providers or business partners may offer sweepstakes, contests, promotions and surveys (each, a **"Promotion"**).

Where we do this, we will use your personal information as set out in this Policy, or as otherwise notified to you. However, in certain cases, a third party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information that you provide in connection with such Promotion. Before entering any Promotion, we encourage you to check who is operating the Promotion in question, and the terms, conditions, policies and rules that apply to it.

### 12\. HOW OLD DO I HAVE TO BE TO USE THE ZEVIA SITES OR OTHER DIGITAL OFFERINGS?

You must be aged 13 or over to use the Zevia website and our other digital offerings.

We take your privacy very seriously and we understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children who use our products and services. We do not solicit or knowingly collect personal information from children aged 13 and under. If we are made aware that we have received such information, or any information in violation of our Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.

_California Minors:_ If you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: [privacy@zevia.com](mailto:privacy@zevia.com). When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don't follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the content or information. Removal of your personal information from the Services does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.

### 13\. DOES THIS POLICY EVER CHANGE?

We may update or modify this Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. We will obtain your consent to any material Policy changes if and where required by applicable data protection laws.

_Your Rights and Choices_

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

### A. Right to Access Personal Information and Data Portability Right

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information we collected about you.
    
* The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
    
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
    
* The categories of third parties with whom we disclose that personal information.
    
* If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the business purpose for which personal information was disclosed, and the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
    
* The categories of personal information that we sold or shared and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the information
    

You also may request that we inform you of specific pieces of personal information that we collected about you. In some instances, you may request that any of this information be provided to you in an electronically portable format.

### B. Right to Delete

You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. If we cannot delete all of your personal information, we will let you know why.

### C. Right to Correct Inaccurate Information

If you believe that any of the personal information, we hold about you is not accurate, you may submit a request for us to correct that information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the information according to your request.

### D. Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing

You may opt out of the sale of your personal information or sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising. To opt out, [click here.](https://www.zevia.com/data-subject-request-form)

### E. Non-Discrimination

You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

### F. Exercising Your Rights

To exercise the access, data portability, correction, opt-out, or deletion rights described above, please submit your request to us:

* [Via webform](https://www.zevia.com/data-subject-request-form); or
    
* Via toll free number at: 855.GO.ZEVIA (855.469.3842)
    

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We will reach out to you for additional information as necessary for us to verify your identity. If you are submitting on someone else's behalf, we may ask you and/or your representative for additional verification. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

### 14\. PRODUCT PURCHASES

Product purchases made through this website are subject to our Terms of Sale set forth below in this Section 14 (the "Terms of Sale"). Please review the Terms of Sale carefully prior to making a purchase through the website. The Terms of Sale are incorporated by reference in these Terms.

#### Terms of Sale

These Terms of Sale apply to the purchase and sale of products through the Services and are subject to change by Zevia without prior written notice at any time, in our sole discretion. By placing an order through the Services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to the Terms of Sale in their entirety and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree to the Terms of Sale, please do not order any product through the Services. Any exclusions and limitations of liability listed below in Section 16 and any disclaimers listed in Section 18 shall apply to these Terms of Sale.

#### General Requirements

By placing an order, you represent and warrant that:

* You are at least 18 years of age (19 in Alabama and Nebraska; 21 in Mississippi);
    
* If you are an individual consumer, the product is being ordered solely for your personal use, and you will not market, resell or otherwise distribute the product to any third party for commercial purposes;
    
* If you are a business, the product is being ordered on the Services solely to promote your own products or services by distributing the product to your customers and others at no cost to the recipient as business gifts or advertising items. You will not resell the product.
    

#### Product Descriptions

We use our reasonable endeavors to make sure that every product available for purchase on the Services is shown accurately and that prices are correct. However, product descriptions, specifications, features and images are subject to change at any time without notice, and occasionally there may be small variations in color, typefaces and layout. Without limiting any of Sections 16 or 18 below, we do not warrant, represent, undertake or covenant in any way that any product description or related information, material or Content accessible using the Services will be accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free, and we are not responsible for errors (typographical or otherwise) in any of the foregoing.

#### Order Acceptance and Cancellation

You agree that your order is an offer to buy, under these Terms, all products listed in your order. All orders must be accepted by us or we will not be obligated to sell the products or services to you. We may choose not to accept any orders in our sole discretion. When you place an order (by choosing your product and completing the online checkout process), we will send you an order acknowledgement by email. This will detail the products you have ordered. Please note that your completion of the online checkout process does not constitute our acceptance of your order. Our acceptance of your order only takes place when we ship it. A contract of sale between you and Zevia is therefore made at the point of shipment, rather than at the point of payment. If you have cancelled your order, or if we notify you that we cannot accept your order, then no contract of sale will have been made. From time to time, we may not be able to accept an order, including for the following reasons: (i) where we cannot obtain authorization for your payment; or (ii) if you do not meet any eligibility criteria set out in the "General Requirements" section of these Terms of Sale. We reserve the right to cancel your order at any time and issue a full refund. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of products to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction.

#### Prices and Payment Terms

All prices posted on the Services are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes. Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email. We are not responsible for pricing, typographical, or other errors in any offer by us and we reserve the right to cancel any orders arising from such errors.

Terms of payment are within our sole discretion and payment must be received by us before our acceptance of an order. We accept major credit or debit cards, PayPal, Shop Pay, or Google Pay for all purchases. You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any.

#### Shipments; Delivery; Title and Risk of Loss

We will arrange for shipment of the products to you. Please check the individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges specified during the ordering process. Orders containing multiple items may be shipped separately.

Title and risk of loss pass to you upon delivery. Shipping and delivery dates are estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments. If any of the details you have given us in your delivery address are incorrect, we are not liable for any items which are not received.

#### Circumstances Beyond Our Control.

Neither we, nor any courier or carrier service that we use, shall be liable for any failure to perform under these Terms, where such failure or delay results from any circumstances outside our reasonable control. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, adverse weather conditions, such as snow, flood, extreme winds, fire, explosion, accident, traffic congestion, obstruction of any private or public highway, acts of governmental authorities, pandemic, riot, terrorism, act of God, or from any industrial dispute or strike.

#### Subscribe and Save Program Terms

If you enroll in our "Subscribe and Save" subscription program when you place an order for Products through the Services, you are: (i) signing up for and agreeing to **automatic, continual shipments** (each, a "Subscription Order") of all such Products that are eligible for the subscription program ("Subscription Products") in accordance with the schedule you select during checkout; and (ii) expressly authorizing Zevia to charge your payment method on a recurring basis as set forth herein without further affirmative authorization from you. Subscription Products may be eligible for an additional percentage discount on Zevia's everyday low prices. You may change your Subscription Order shipping schedule, shipping method, shipping address and payment method and the Subscription Products included in your Subscription Orders at any time (provided that such changes will not apply to any Subscription Order authorized in accordance with these terms prior to Zevia's receipt of your change request). Such changes may be made by signing into your account on [https://www.zevia.com](https://www.zevia.com/)  and selecting the "Manage Subscriptions" link under Account Details or Order History.

**Your subscription program (and the associated Subscription Orders) will continue until canceled by you (provided that such cancellation will not apply to any Subscription Order authorized in accordance with these terms prior to Zevia's receipt of your cancellation request). You may cancel at any time by signing into your account on** [**https://www.zevia.com**](https://www.zevia.com/) **and selecting the "Manage Subscriptions" link.**

When you place your initial Subscription Order, your payment method will be charged and the Subscription Order will be processed immediately. For each subsequent Subscription Order (which will be placed automatically per the schedule you have selected), at least three days prior to the date you are scheduled to be charged, you will receive a pre-shipment email notification reminding you of your upcoming shipment that includes (i) the prices for the Subscription Products in the applicable Subscription Order, as well as all applicable discounts, taxes, fees, shipping charges and other charges (collectively, the "Total Fees"), (ii) the period during which you may request changes to the applicable Subscription Order, and (iii) the scheduled shipment date. Following your receipt of such notification, you may edit or cancel such Subscription Order through our website, [https://www.zevia.com](https://www.zevia.com/), until 11:59 pm. Eastern Time on the day immediately preceding the applicable shipment date. If you do not cancel the Subscription Order by such time, the Subscription Order will be deemed authorized, and a credit card authorization hold will be placed on your payment method in the amount of the Total Fees. You will see a pending charge during this time as we process the Subscription Order. Once your Subscription Order is processed and shipped, your payment method will be charged for the Total Fees. Note that a payment authorization hold is not an actual charge, and although the hold may appear on your payment method account, you will be charged only one time for each Subscription Order. A payment authorization hold may impact the amount of credit available to you under your payment method. Any credit balances you may have on your subscription program account may be applied toward the balance of your order and Zevia will charge the remaining balance to your payment method. If we are unable to process payment, you will receive a "card declined" notification. If a valid payment method is not updated within the account, our system will wait a day and then send out an additional notification each day, for up to 8 days. If a valid payment method is not updated within the account after the 8th day, you will receive an email cancelling the Subscription Order, any active subscriptions, and removing any pending charges.

Zevia reserves the right to change or cancel the "Subscribe and Save" program (or any element or benefit thereof, including without limitation eligible Products, Subscription Product prices, discount amounts, delivery schedule and delivery method options, payment method options, and terms and conditions applicable to the program), at any time, with or without notice to you (provided that Zevia will not change prices for a Subscription Order that has been authorized in accordance with these terms). You expressly acknowledge and agree that certain elements, benefits and offers of your subscription program may change over time (for example, prices, discounts, availability, shipping charges and taxes), and Zevia does not guarantee that any of the foregoing will remain the same during your subscription program. All Subscription Products are subject to availability. Zevia reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any Subscription Order or terminate your subscription program at any time, with or without notice to you, including without limitation due to an invalid payment method. Your subscription program is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred to any third party. Your subscription program, and all Subscription Orders and Subscription Products, are subject to all terms and conditions set forth under "Terms of Sale" above and all other terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.

#### Refund Policy

Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns or exchanges of product. If your order was damaged in transit, or if you've received the wrong order, please reach out to our Customer Care team immediately, by emailing [shop@zevia.com](mailto:shop@zevia.com) or calling 1.855.GO.ZEVIA (1.855.469.3842), and we will either send you a replacement or offer you an equal exchange credit. If you believe there is a quality issue with your product, please take note of the Lot Code (a series of numbers with a timecode that is printed near the Expiration Date), so that we can trace the specific batch of product you have received. These inquiries will be handled on a case by case basis.

### 15\. PROMOTIONS

From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one or more sweepstakes, contests, challenges, activities, surveys, or similar promotions made available through the Services (each, a "Promotion"). Each Promotion will be governed by specific rules that are separate from these Terms. By participating in any such sweepstakes, contest, challenge, activity, survey, or other promotion, you will become subject to those rules, which may vary from the terms and conditions set forth herein. We urge you to read the applicable rules, which are linked from or otherwise made available in connection with the particular Promotion, and to review our Privacy Policy which, in addition to these Terms, governs any information you submit in connection with such Promotion. If you engage in any fraudulent or unsportsmanlike activity or act contrary to the applicable rules, these Terms or any laws, your participation and account privileges may be suspended or terminated, resulting in the loss of offers, prizes or other items.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, we reserve the right to modify, terminate or suspend the availability of Promotions and to correct errors or inconsistencies in Promotion-related materials. CAUTION: ANY ATTEMPT BY ANY INDIVIDUAL TO DELIBERATELY UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF A PROMOTION IS A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM SUCH INDIVIDUAL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

### 16\. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

### 23\. COPYRIGHT POLICY

#### Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements

Zevia takes claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any materials accessible on or from the Services infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials (or access to them) from the Services by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated below. In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) ("DMCA"), the written notice (the "DMCA Notice") must include substantially the following:

1. Your physical or electronic signature (or the signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the applicable copyrighted work);
    
2. Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works on the Services, a representative list of such works;
    
3. Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material;
    
4. Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address);
    
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
    
6. A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate;
    
7. A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
    

If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the Services is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

#### Designated Copyright Agent

Our designated copyright agent to receive DMCA Notices is:

#### Counter Notification Procedures

If you believe that material you posted on the Services was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter notification with us (a **"Counter Notice"**) by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated above. Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter Notice must include substantially the following:

The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten (10) business days of receiving the copy of your Counter Notice.

Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the Services was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.

#### Repeat Infringers

If we determine that an individual is the subject of multiple DMCA notices, then we may, in our sole discretion, take any number of steps, such as issuing warnings, suspending or terminating the individual's account, or any other measures that we deem appropriate.

### 24\. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

These Terms of Use and any disputes arising from or in relation to them, whether contractual or non-contractual, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of California.

#### Dispute Resolution Terms (Please Read Carefully)

#### Binding Arbitration

Certain portions of this Binding Arbitration section are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Zevia agree that we intend that this section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.

You and Zevia agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to use of the Services or any aspect of the relationship between you and Zevia (each, a **"Dispute"**). The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (**"AAA"**) Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect. If for any reason, AAA is unable or unwilling to conduct the arbitration consistent with these terms, we will pick another arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S. Code §5. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.

Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts.

Zevia's procurement teams build long-term working relationships with Suppliers to ensure they can identify opportunities for improvement and work together towards common objectives. Zevia makes sure every buyer is aware of Zevia's expectations of Suppliers, knows how to evaluate them and is familiar with sustainability issues related to specific commodities.

It is Zevia's intention that the sustainability performance of its Suppliers will be rated by [EcoVadis](https://ecovadis.com/) , an independent evaluation company. EcoVadis evaluates Suppliers for criteria such as environment, carbon management, human rights, and fair business practices.
