##### **MobileJump DMCA Policy**

MobileJump is a service provider of transitory digital network communications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") 17 U.S.C. p. 512(a). Accordingly, it is MobileJump's policy to promptly terminate without notice the accounts of those determined by MobileJump to be repeat infringers, where a repeat infringer is an end user of the MobileJump Services who has been notified by MobileJump of infringing transmissions activities more than twice ("Repeat Infringer Policy"). Because of the ephemeral nature of transmissions imitated at the direction of persons using the MobileJump Service, it is generally not possible for MobileJump to take-down content from its system, but it will use all reasonable efforts to identify the offending persons in order to enforce its Repeat Infringer Policy.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
