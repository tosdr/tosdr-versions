Uploadfiles Premium Accounts - Payment, Renewal and Cancellation
----------------------------------------------------------------

Premium Services (“Subscription”) require you to pay a fee, which is described in greater detail below. You agree to pay all fees and charges you incur, in US dollars with a major credit card accepted by Uploadfiles. Subscription fees are non-refundable except as expressly set forth below. You hereby authorise us to charge your credit card to pay for the ongoing cost of Subscription. Payment for the appropriate Subscription and/or Services will be made by automatic charges to your credit card. Upon its expiration, your Subscription will be automatically renewed for a term (1) equal to the original subscription term or (2) in accordance with the terms of a special subscription offer (“Promotion”), and continually renewed for equal terms thereafter, unless you terminate your Subscription pursuant to the process set forth below. You acknowledge and agree that the authorisation to charge your credit card for our Subscriptions shall automatically transfer to any successors or assigns of the Services.

The billing period ends each term on the anniversary of your activation date. You agree to pay all fees and charges that you incur through your account, including, but not limited to, applicable taxes. You will be responsible for charges for any products or services that you purchase that are offered for sale through our Services. In addition, you are responsible for paying any amounts billed to your credit card by someone who uses your card, such as a secondary card holder or family member, or if you authorised use of your card by someone else for the initial Subscription. If payment cannot be charged to your credit card or your payment is returned to us for any reason, including chargeback, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your account and our obligations under this Agreement. If you provide us with a new/updated card and are successfully charged, your renewal period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.

PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE RENEWED AT THE THEN CURRENT NON-PROMOTIONAL FEE. SOME YEARLY PLANS, WERE OFFERED FOR THE INITIAL 12 MONTHS ONLY AND MAY BEGIN BILLING MONTHLY STARTING THE 13TH MONTH AFTER SIGNUP. From time to time, we may offer different subscription plans and the fees for such plans may vary. A detailed description of current premium services and features can be found on the Product Matrix page or by contacting Customer Service.

You may cancel a Subscription at any time through your My Account page. Your account will remain active for the remainder of the term for which you have previously paid after which it will revert to a standard free account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account. Cancellation of your Subscription will not relieve you of any obligations to pay accrued charges, including any prorated charges accrued for the billing cycle in which your Subscription is cancelled. We are not responsible for any accounting errors or oversights older than sixty (60) days. Uploadfiles may, without compensation or proration, cancel your Subscription in the event of nonpayment or dispute of payment or if you violate any terms or conditions of this Agreement.

_Which means: Your credit card will automatically be charged for renewals. Promotional and some yearly subscription plans, at renewal, are billed monthly at the then current fee. You can cancel at any time from your account, or contact customer service. You can buy an upgraded account or services._

Refund Policy:
--------------

Uploadfiles may approve a thirty (30) day money-back refund at their discretion, **after a review of Services utilised**, which would apply only to the initial charge of your first Subscription with Uploadfiles. This does not apply to re-established subscriptions, changes in subscriptions or creations of subsequent subscriptions. Your account will then revert to a free account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account.

REFUND REQUESTS should be submitted to Uploadfiles by email at [\[email protected\]](https://ufile.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

_Which means: First time users may request a refund of their first month Subscription fee and be converted to a free account user, **if they have not used the service or downloaded any files**._

As-Is Services

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

NEITHER UPLOADFILES NOR ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL UPLOADFILES AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN UPLOADFILES AND YOU.

The Services are controlled and offered by Uploadfiles from its facilities in the United Kingdom. Uploadfiles makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

_Which means: Also standard contract capitalised language. This clarifies that we limit our responsibility if something goes wrong._

Indemnity
---------

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Uploadfiles and its affiliates, and both Uploadfiles and their respective officers, directors, owners, employees, agents, information providers and licensors harmless from and against any and all claims, liability, losses, damages, obligations, costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by any Uploadfiles Party in connection with any Content or use of the Services, whether via your password and/or by any other person, whether or not authorised by you. Uploadfiles reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with Uploadfiles's defense of such claim. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the Services.

_Which means: If we get in trouble because of something you did or should have done, you’ll defend us in court or help us defend ourselves._

Miscellaneous Legal
-------------------

The Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Uploadfiles without restriction.

The Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Uploadfiles each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the HM Courts & Tribunals Services ("Courts") with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to the Agreement or to the Services and /or Content and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such as action, suit or proceeding; additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts.

These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by Uploadfiles on the Services, the Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of the Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of the Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.

No failure in delay in exercising or enforcing this policy shall constitute a waiver of the Agreement or any other right or remedy. If any provision of the Agreement is deemed unenforceable due to law or change in law, such a provision shall be disregarded and the balance of the Agreement shall remain in effect.

YOU AND UPLOADFILES AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
