#### Purchases/Returns Policy

We at The Sensory KidsÂ® Store care about our customers, which is why we provide you with a 30-day return policy\* for all full-priced merchandise. If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, simply request aÂ Â **Return Authorization**Â within 30 days of your purchase date.

* * *

All returns must be in re-sellable, as-new condition. Any 'boxed' items must be returned in original, unopened packaging with all packing materials, manuals, registration and warranty cards.

* * *

Due to the nature of our business and the importance of protecting your kids, The Sensory KidsÂ® Store cannot accept any returns of items that appear to have had a prior use. This policy applies, but is not limited to; washed or used clothing, soft goods, chews and other special-order medical items. These items are not returnable unless due to a manufacturer's defect or otherwise specified. All returns will be inspected by our returns specialist. The Sensory KidsÂ® Store reserves the right to use its discretion in determining "prior use."

All returns must be authorized by The Sensory KidsÂ® Store within 30 days from the original invoice date. Shipping and Handling charges are non-refundable. The Sensory KidsÂ® Store cannot accept any return without prior authorization. To request a Return Authorization Number (RA#), please email the following information toÂ [info@sensorykidstore.com](mailto:%20info@sensorykidstore.com):

* * *

1. Your Name
2. Email Address
3. Sensory Kidsâ¢ Invoice Number
4. Invoice Date
5. Item Number/s and description/s of product/s being returned
6. Reason for return

* * *

If any of this requested information is missing from your email, NO Return Authorization will be issued. NO EXCEPTIONS

Once we have approved your return, we will issue you a Return Authorization Number (RA#). Clearly mark this number on the outside of your return packaging. You should receive your Return Authorization Number via email within 2-3 business days. Return Authorization Numbers will only be issued within 30 days of the original invoice date and are good for a period of 15 days from the date of issue, during which period returns must be received at The Sensory KidsÂ® Store.

Customer is responsible for any and all return shipping charges. Returned items that were purchased with free shipping will be refunded the product cost less our shipping expense. We recommend using one of our approved carriers, ensuring your shipment and obtaining proof of delivery in case of loss or damage in transit.Â The Sensory KidsÂ® StoreÂ assumes no responsibility for returns that are damaged or lost in transit.

Please allow 14-30 days for your return to be inspected and for accounting to issue your credit, refund or exchange. If a credit card refund is requested a 5% handling fee will be charged. While Sensory Kidsâ¢ will always try our best to provide you with exactly what you need â due to our rapidly changing inventory â we can not guarantee exchanges.

#### Defective Items Policy

If your item is defective, please follow the return policy above. Should you have any additional questions about our warranties or guarantees, please contact us and see ourÂ [Terms & Conditions](https://www.sensorykidstore.com/terms-and-conditions). You must notify us in writing within 15 days of receipt of purchase for the exchange or refund of a defective product.

#### Order Cancellation Policy

Order cancellations must be submitted to The Sensory KidsÂ® Store in writing prior to Midnight EST the same day as the placement of the order with the exception of expedited orders. Orders cancelled after the Midnight EST limit, but before shipment, will be charged a 10% cancellation fee. Once the order has shipped, it becomes the customer's responsibility and aÂ **Return Authorization Number**Â must be obtained once your order has arrived if you wish to return the package.

#### Shipping Policy

Most orders ship within 1 to 2 business days after credit/gift card approval. Please expect to receive your items within 7-10 business days when shipped via First-Class, Ground or Standard Post. We will upgrade your shipping to USPS Priority Mail whenever possible. Please note that while USPS estimates their Priority deliveries as 1-2 day shipping, they do not guarantee delivery within those times. If 1 or 2 day delivery is essential, please choose USPS Express Mail service, UPS Overnight or UPS 2-Day shipping. The Sensory KidsÂ® Store ships during normal business hours with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Orders placed on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays will not ship until the next available business day. For shipping purposes, the date of purchase is considered the following business day for any orders received after 3PM CST.

Your order will always be processed as quickly as possible. However, shipping and delivery times may vary based on the products you order. Shipping times may be subject to delay without notice. If there is any unforeseen delay, you will be notified.

We currently ship products anywhere in the United States and Canada (Canada customers are responsible for all tax and duties that apply). If you are outside of our shipping area, please call for special shipping rates and availability.

The Sensory KidsÂ® Store currently uses USPS and UPS to ship. Any orders placed with Expedited Shipping are usually shipped the same day if the order is received by 3PM CST Monday thru Friday. Expedited Shipping orders are filled first and receive priority over all other orders. Once your order ships you will receive a confirmation email with your tracking number. Orders may arrive in multiple packages. This will not affect your shipping charges. Except in certain circumstances, such as special orders, your credit card will not be charged for any product that has not yet shipped. You will be notified by e-mail if there are any delays in shipping.Â 

The Sensory KidsÂ® Store reserves the right to change shipping method if the charges are of equal or lesser value, to ensure our customers receive their products in the most time efficient method.

Shipping costs are calculated based on shipping method, weight, and distance. Larger, bulkier and heavier items such as furniture, wall panels and swing sets may have an additional overweight handling surcharge to cover extra shipping costs. Such extra charges are noted as such under the product information for those particular products and will be charged separately once the total freight cost has been calculated.Â 

Gift Cards are delivered either electronically or via mail (per your instructions) and should arrive within 1-5 business days depending on delivery method chosen and credit card approval. Purchasers are responsible for providing accurate and deliverable e-mail or postal address information.

Some items that require special handling, and expedited shipping is not available to Alaska, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Sorry, but we are unable to ship internationally at this time.

#### Our Most Important Policy

We appreciate your business and want you to know that we constantly strive to provide you with the best service and products available for you and your family. If you would like to see us offer a product that we don't presently carry, please email us. We love suggestions and value your opinion!
