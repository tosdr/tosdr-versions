#### User Interactions

**

We aim to make sure that our platforms are a place for friendly and constructive interactions. If any kind of dispute or conflict does arise between you and another user, the responsibilities in these regards lie with the users. If we do intervene in the interest of investigating potential improper activity, we expect Our users to cooperate.

**

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Service and any other parties with whom you interact through the Service. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to become involved in any way with potential disputes in these regards. You will fully cooperate with Us to investigate any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper activity, including.

#### Blockchain Interactions

**

Our platforms offer various features that allow you to export data to the blockchain and utilize cryptocurrencies. Due to the nature of blockchain technology, we want to be clear that any blockchain items you have received on your blockchain wallet or cryptocurrency funds you hold on your blockchain wallet fall fully under your own responsibility as they are not under our control. As blockchain transactions fundamentally involve interacting with an external blockchain network that is not under our control, we can not be held responsible for any technical or user error that might affect you. Your mnemonic, private key, PIN or any other type of access details related to your blockchain assets are as a result also solely your responsibility and can not be expected to be restored or retrieved by us in any situation. We also make no guarantees regarding whether any kind of virtual items that can be or have been exported to the blockchain in terms of whether or not we will accept, grant, represent or reimburse them under any conditions. While our service may offer wallet functionality, we highly recommend keeping valuable assets on a secure separate wallet.

**

You accept and acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilizing any virtual currency or items through blockchain technology, such as unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol. Due to the nature of blockchain technology and how any blockchain assets you may store or interact with exist outside of Our Service, all blockchain assets you create and blockchain-based interactions you engage in fall under your own responsibility. You accept and acknowledge that We will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, delays or changes in perceived value of any blockchain assets or items you may experience when using Our Service, however caused. You acknowledge and accept that We have no control over any cryptocurrency network and will not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of such risks. We will not be responsible or liable to you for any loss and take no responsibility for and will not be liable to you for any use of Our Service, including but not limited to any losses, damages or claims arising from (i) user error such as forgotten passwords, incorrectly constructed transactions or mistyped virtual Currency addresses; (ii) server failure or data loss; (iii) corrupted Wallet files; (iv) unauthorized access to applications; (v) any unauthorized third party activites, including without limitation the use of viruses, phishing, brute forcing or other means of attack against the Our Service. When contacted, Our Support will always attempt to assist with any issues you may experience related to Our Service and this also applies to interactions with the blockchain through Our Service. But you accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law. While We attempt to make the user experience of interacting with blockchain technology as easy and convenient as possible, We highly recommend learning more about and familiarizing yourself more with the blockchain technologies We use (such as Ethereum) if you are not familiar. While Our Service provides you with tools to help you safely store your private key and/or mnemonic, We do not receive or store details such as your mnemonic or private key that are used to access your blockchain assets and can not retrieve them for you.

#### Your Responsibilities

We reserve the right to determine what conduct We consider to be in violation of Our Terms of Service and/or Privacy Policy or what may seem to violate it in spirit. We reserve the right to take action as a result, which may include terminating your Account and prohibiting you from using the Service in whole or in part.

#### Donations

**

Keep in mind that donations are just donations, not payments for a service of any kind (even when they result in gifts or music played on stream). You are responsible for any donations you make or receive and can not expect anything in return for your donation. GamingForGood.net, as a website, acts as a 'portal' site and does not process the donation transactions. For issues specifically related to donation transactions, we always recommend you either reach out to the streamer or the payment provider.

**

By making a donation You agree that: (i) We shall not be liable for the manner in which a recipient uses any donation funds received; (ii) We shall notify recipients of donations, however, in no event shall We be liable for any unclaimed or unacknowledged donations nor shall We be liable for error in or failure to notify the recipients; (iii) the recipient is not required to accept or acknowledge any donation; (iv) We reserve the right to change Our payment processor at any time; (v) We are not responsible for any fees, other amounts charged by any financial institution, or any taxes relating to funds received or paid in connection with transmitting a donation; (vi) You have received nothing in-kind in exchange for your donation, and (vii) We reserve the right to determine whether any fees shall be deducted from a donator’s remittance or from the recipient’s balance.

Donations made to charitable organizations, such as to Save the Children, through Our Service may be tax deductible based upon the laws specific to your jurisdiction. We do not provide tax advice and it is incumbent upon you to secure competent information from a lawyer or tax advisor for information about the tax implications of your donation and required documentation.

In the event of a chargeback, refunded or voided donation, or other refund, credit, adjustment, fine, penalty, or other amount due to manifest error or legal requirement, Our donation payment processor may debit your account. Recipient hereby authorizes Our payment processor to make ACH or other online debits to the recipient's account, and to resubmit any such debit that is returned unpaid, e.g., for insufficient funds. Our payment processor may place a reasonable hold or reserve on a donation with a high risk of chargeback, refund or the like.

If You enroll in recurring monthly donations through Our donation payment processor, you agree that said authorization may remain in place for Our payment processor to debit your selected method of payment until such time as you notify Our payment processor to terminate this authorization.

#### Fees and Purchases

**

Any purchases of non-blockchain virtual items or virtual currencies in our service may result in access to but not ownership of these items. These purchases and redemptions are not refundable and we are free to make any changes to our platforms that could affect your virtual items or currencies in any shape or form. You also agree to pay all fees and taxes that may apply. Some items or currencies can become fully yours once they are on your own personal blockchain wallet that you have access to and control over.

**

In Our Service, you may purchase or unlock, with “real world” money or through other means such as vouchers, codes, cryptocurrency or other blockchain assets a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use (a) “virtual currency” which is represented in Our Service and maintained on Our servers (this excludes blockchain assets that are stored on your Wallet or otherwise on a blockchain contract), including but not limited to virtual cash or gems, all for use in Our Service and/or (b) “virtual in-game items” (together with “virtual currency”, “Virtual Items”).

We may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. We shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that We exercise any such rights.

All purchases and redemptions of virtual items made through the Service are final and non-refundable.

You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. We may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Service at any time. You acknowledge that We are not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when an account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary.

#### Account Creation

**

By logging in on our service with your Twitch account or other third party service account, you may give us and our payment processor some information that allows us to set up your Dashboard and allow donations through our payment processor. For full transparency, We made sure to include as much detail as possible about this in our Privacy Policy.

**

#### Suspension and Termination of Account and Service

**

We think it’s very important that our platforms are fair for everyone. Sometimes this means we suspend or terminate accounts if we find it necessary. These decisions can be contested via our Support but can not be legally disputed as we are not obliged to offer access to our service or compensation for any losses or consequences resulting from account suspension or termination.

**

We may at any point, at Our discretion, limit, suspend, terminate, modify or delete accounts or access to the Service or portions thereof if you are, or We suspect that you are, failing to comply with any of these Terms of Service or for any actual or suspected illegal or improper use of the Service, with or without notice to you.

We may at any point, at Our discretion, limit, suspend or terminate the Service and user accounts or portions thereof, prohibit access to Our games, apps and Sites, and their content, services and tools, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to prevent users from accessing the Service if We believe that they are creating risk or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of Our terms or policies. Additionally, We may, in appropriate circumstances and at Our sole discretion, suspend or terminate accounts and/or access of users who may be repeat infringers of third party intellectual property rights.

We reserve the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Service or a particular game or part of the Service at any time. In such event, We shall not be required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to users in connection with the discontinuation of Our Service or a portion thereof. Termination of your Account can include disabling your access to the Service or any part thereof including any content you submitted or others submitted.

#### Privacy

**

We always try to protect your privacy and to be transparent about how we collect information and for what purpose. This is part of the reason why we have an elaborate and easy to understand Privacy Policy on a separate page that We recommend you take a few minutes for to read.

**

We respect your privacy and do Our best to protect it in every way. We shall be entitled to use your User Information for the following purposes: (i) internal market research, including statistical analysis of user behavior (ii) to comply with any requirements imposed upon on Us by law; (iii) to send You relevant periodic communications through email, text and/or mobile push notifications as well as any kind of notice or updates that you may have given explicit consent for (iv) to disclose necessary information to recipients and Our payment processor for the purpose of effectuating donations (v) to utilize your twitch ID or other user ID related to the third party service you logged in with to thank You for your donation on Our Service (vi) to track and process your game progress (vii) to present the information you post or submit in ways that are accurate and appropriate within the features of the Service. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute publicly displayed content such as username, avatar and emotes that are provided by your third party service account (that you use to connect to Our Service) in applications, broadcasts, publications or promotions by Us that are related or unrelated to GamingForGood.net, MobileMinigames.com, and/or Mobile Minigames. You agree that this license includes the right for Us to provide, promote and improve Our Services and to make this content available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication on other media and services.

Additionally, You should be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the use of Cookies. “Cookies” are small text files that store basic information that a Website can use to recognize repeated site visits and as an example, recall your name if this has been previously supplied. We may use this to observe behavior and compile aggregate data in order to improve the Site, target advertising and assess general effectiveness of such advertising.

Cookies do not attach to your system and/or damage your files. If You do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows You to deny or accept the Cookie feature.

**

However, Our Service is not required or obliged in any shape or form to acknowledge, represent or interface with any blockchain assets you own, whether created or derived from Our Service or otherwise.

#### Liability

**

In closing, here's some typical 'liability' legalese that basically says that while we do our best to make all content and information on our site and apps/games as accurate and free of errors as possible, We are not responsible for the consequences of potential errors.

**

We try to assure the accuracy, security and stability of Our Service, but despite Our best efforts it is possible that it may contain inaccuracies or errors (collectively, “Errors”).

#### Additional Terms and Conditions; EULAs

While G2A Pay services are no longer integrated with GamingForGood.net, the following terms are still included for reference. When you use G2A Pay services provided by G2A.COM Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "G2A Pay services provider") to make a donation on Our website, responsibility over your donation will first be transferred to G2A.COM Limited before it is transferred to the streamer. G2A Pay services provider assumes primary responsibility, with Our assistance, for payment and payment related customer support. The terms between G2A Pay services provider and customers who utilize services of G2A Pay are governed by separate agreements and are not subject to the Terms on this website.

With respect to customers making donations through G2A Pay services provider checkout, (i) the Privacy Policy of G2A Pay services provider shall apply to all payments and should be reviewed before making any donations, and (ii) the G2A Pay services provider Refund Policy shall apply to all payments unless notice is expressly provided by the relevant streamer to donors in advance. In addition the donation may also require donors to agree to one or more End-User License Agreements (or "EULAs") that may include additional terms set by the streamer rather than by Us or G2A Pay services provider. You will be bound by any EULA that you agree to.

G2A Pay services provider is primarily responsible for facilitating your payment.

You are responsible for any fees, taxes or other costs associated with the donation resulting from charges imposed by your relationship with payment service providers or the duties and taxes imposed by your local customs officials or other regulatory body.

By using our Mobile Minigames app, you may at any time also be subject to the Terms of Service of these third party services that are integrated (click on these links to read each service’s own terms): [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), [Discord](https://discordapp.com/terms), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) and [Unity](https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy). You should not install, use or otherwise access our service if you do not agree with any of these third party service terms. For example: Mobile Minigames uses the YouTube API Services to allow players to livestream. This means that YouTube and Google's [Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) applies. The Singularity Group, The Naughty Cult Ltd., Mobile Minigames, MobileMinigames.com, GamingForGood.net and our Service in general are not created, run or endorsed by Apple, Reddit, Twitch, Google, YouTube, Discord, Facebook or Unity. When our Service runs any form of promotion through either of these platforms or their services, they are not a sponsor of, or responsible for conducting, the promotion.

For customer service inquiries or disputes, You may contact us by email at support@mobileminigames.com.

Questions related to payments made through G2A Pay services provider should be addressed to support@g2a.com.

Where possible, We will work with You and/or any user receiving donations on Our website, to resolve any disputes arising from your donation.

#### Final

Since The Naughty Cult’s administrative headquarters are at Stefan Karadzha Street 10, Floor 3-4 in Sofia (1000) in Bulgaria, Bulgarian laws apply. We do Our best to treat all Our users fairly and are able to judge, at Our own discretion, on a case-by-case basis when action needs to be taken towards accounts of users whose behaviour may be unacceptable.

These Terms and Conditions, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection to them, will be governed by the laws of Bulgaria and Sofia without reference to the choice of law principles thereof. User hereby consents to and submits to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Bulgaria. User waives any defenses based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or venue, or inconvenient forum. If any provision herein is unenforceable, then such provision shall be of no effect on any other provision hereof. No waiver of any breach hereof shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach hereof. Section headings are provided for convenience only, and shall not be used to construe the meaning of any section hereof.

We reserve the right to immediately terminate your use of Our Service if you breach or We have reasonable grounds to believe that you are likely to breach these Terms and Conditions or you otherwise engage in conduct which We determine in Our sole discretion to be unacceptable.
