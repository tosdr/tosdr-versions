**PRIVACY POLICY  
**Maintaining the privacy of your personal information is important to NCMEC. This Privacy Policy describes how NCMEC collects and maintains personal information from the Sites. By visiting the Sites you consent to the practices described in the Privacy Policy. NCMEC's Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party web sites, and third party web sites may have their own privacy policies. NCMEC assumes no liability for how third parties may collect and/or use your personal information

**Information NCMEC Collects  
**You may provide certain personal information, including but not limited to name, street address, email address, telephone number and payment information (when purchasing materials or making donations online), to NCMEC when visiting the Sites. NCMEC may use this personal information periodically to communicate with you concerning NCMEC issues, such as delivering information about upcoming events. NCMEC also collects your personal information if you submit information about a missing or exploited child case through NCMEC's CyberTipline or other portions of the Sites.

NCMEC also may collect technical data from visitors to the Sites, including but not limited to IP addresses and domain names, in order to track the number and frequency of visits NCMEC receives to certain pages of the Sites. NCMEC also may identify the external website link that brings you to the Sites. NCMEC does not associate this technical data with any personally identifiable information in NCMEC's databases unless a security intrusion or other unlawful activity is detected on the Sites.

**Information Shared with Third Parties  
**If you make a report about a missing or exploited child on the Sites and submit personal information, NCMEC will forward that information to the appropriate law enforcement agency for review. If you submit credit card information on the Sites, NCMEC will forward that information to a service that processes the payment or donation. NCMEC occasionally may share aggregated information about visitors to the Sites, which will show visitor activity without identifying particular individual users.

**Cookies  
**The Sites may use Cookies (small text files transferred to the computer you are using to browse the Sites) to enhance your experience when visiting the Sites. Cookies can facilitate navigation of the Sites, including but not limited to saving certain personal preferences regarding your use of the Sites. NCMEC uses cookies to increase the efficiency of certain searches you may conduct on the Sites. You can refuse to accept cookies and still use the Sites, but some portions of the Sites may not function properly without cookies.

**Security  
**NCMEC maintains control of any names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses submitted by users of its website. Access to submitted names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses and personally identifiable information is restricted to NCMEC employees and authorized third party service providers who process donation payments. NCMEC and its authorized third party service providers comply with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards), adopted by the major credit card and financial companies to secure personally identifiable information. The PCI DSS protocols employed by NCMEC and its authorized third party service providers include but is not limited to: establishing appropriate technical, physical and organizational security procedures to protect personally identifiable information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification; limited access to storage areas and locked files; use and regular update of anti-virus software on all systems commonly affected by malware; and the use of encryption, secure servers, and unique computer workstation identification and passwords. NCMEC monitors these procedures regularly and when needed to ensure their continued effectiveness.

**Information from Children Under the Age of 13  
**NCMEC requires the consent of parents or guardians in order for children under the age of 13 to use certain features of the Sites. Children under the age of 13 can view content and play certain games on [www.netsmartz.org](http://www.netsmartz.org/) without any personal information being collected. NCMEC does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 13 except for certain limited activities, such as to receive bulletins from NCMEC or enter a NCMEC contest. In all such instances, the child is required to provide their parent's or guardian's email address so NCMEC can obtain consent from the parent or guardian. At any time a parent or guardian can notify NCMEC that he or she no longer wishes the child to receive information from NCMEC. For more information, please visit [www.netsmartz.org](http://www.netsmartz.org/). NCMEC encourages children to visit the Sites and learn more about NCMEC's programs, but recommends that parents closely supervise their children's activities on the Sites and on all web sites and talk to their children about restrictions on submitting information online. If you are a child under the age of 13 and have information you would like to report to NCMEC about yourself or another child, please call 1-800-843-5678.

**Questions  
**If you have questions regarding the Privacy Policy please contact NCMEC's Office of Legal Counsel at The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, 333 John Carlyle St, Suite 125, Alexandria, Virginia 22314; telephone number 800-843-5678; legal@ncmec.org.
