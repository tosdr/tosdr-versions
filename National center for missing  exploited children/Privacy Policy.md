* Other Parties. We may disclose your Personal Information to legal, governmental, or judicial authorities, as instructed or required by those authorities or applicable laws, or to other parties in relation to legal process, such as in response to a subpoena.

**COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

Every time you come to the Sites, our Site automatically collects information, including, in some instances, Personal Information, through cookies, web beacons, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively “cookies”). Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies help the website remember information about your visit, which can make it easier to visit the website again and make the website more useful to you. Some cookies are deleted once you close your browser (session cookies), while other cookies are retained even after you close your browser so that you can be recognized when you return to a website (persistent cookies). More information about cookies and how they work is available at www.allaboutcookies.org. 

Cookies on our website are generally divided into the following categories:

| Cookie Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Essential Cookies | These are cookies that our Site needs in order to function and that enable you to move around and use the Site and features. Without these essential cookies, the Site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like it to, and we may not be able to provide the Site or certain services or features you request. Examples of where these cookies are used include: to determine when you are signed in, to determine when your account has been inactive, and for other troubleshooting and security purposes. |
| Analytics and Performance Cookies | Analytics and performance cookies provide us with information regarding how visitors navigate and interact with our Site. Such cookies allow us to understand, for example, more about how many visitors we have to our Site, how many times they visit us and how many times a user viewed specific pages within our Site. Among other Analytics cookies, we use Google Analytics cookies for these purposes. For more information about Google Analytics, please refer to “How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps that Use Our Services,” which can be found at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time. |
| Advertising Cookies | Advertising cookies may be placed by us or third parties to enable third party ad networks to recognize a unique cookie on your computer or mobile device. The information that is collected and shared by these types of cookies may also be linked to the device identifier of the device you are using to allow us to keep track of all the websites you have visited that are associated with the ad network. This information may be used for the purpose of targeting advertisements on our website and third-party websites based on those interests. |

We may use the information collected through cookies and related tracking technologies for the following purposes:  

* To make our website easier to use and generally improve its performance.
* To gather metrics about how you interact with our Site.
* For security reasons.
* To provide personalized content. For example, we may store user preferences, your default language, device and browser information, and your profile information, which includes the level of your usage of the Site so we can identify you across devices and personalize the content you see.
* To advertise to you via behavioral based/targeted advertising and allow others to do the same. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent this. If you disable cookies, your ability to use some features of the Site may be limited. For mobile devices, you may be able to manage certain cookies using your built-in mobile device settings and controls. Any choices concerning cookies are browser and/or device specific. If you clear your cookies from your browser on any of your devices, your choices will need to be reset. You should check how to do this on your device(s) and operating systems. 

Some cookie providers may also offer opportunities to control your preferences. To learn how to opt-out of Google Analytics, an analytics cookie, please visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Jz9cCD9nZsgZ08of5-quD). 

Some of these cookies may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications.  The use of cookies by third-party service providers is within their control and not ours.  We do not control their websites or their policies and practices regarding your Personal Information, and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites you encounter on the Internet.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third-party service provider may directly collect from you, and we do not undertake to confirm, investigate, or police their practices.

**YOUR CHOICES**

You may be able to make the following choices regarding your Personal Information:

* **Emails.** You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters and bulletins, surveys, and other news and informational materials to you. You can stop receiving emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in emails that you receive. If you decide not to receive emails, we may still send you service-related communications.
* **Mailings.**  If at any time you do not want to receive updates, newsletters, bulletins, or information from us, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with “NO SNAIL MAIL” in the subject line, along with your name, address and zip code.  Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.

Please address requests and questions about your choices to the information detailed in the “Contact Information” section of this Privacy Policy.

**YOUR RIGHTS**

Depending on where you are located (e.g., the European Union, Switzerland, United Kingdom), you may have certain rights regarding your Personal Information. The rights available to you depend on our reason for processing your Personal Information and the requirements of applicable law. Specifically, you may have the following rights: 

* **Right to access:** You may have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether Personal Information concerning you is being processed.
* **Right to data portability:** You may have the right to request that we transfer the Personal Information we have collected about you to another organization, or directly to you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions. 
* **Right to correction:** You may have the right to request that we correct any Personal Information about you that is inaccurate. 
* **Right to deletion:** You may have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information, under certain conditions. 
* **Right to withdraw consent:** Where we rely on your consent to process your Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal. 
* **Right to restrict processing:** You may have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information, under certain conditions. In such case, the respective data will be marked and may only be processed by us for certain purposes.
* **Right to object to processing:** You may have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information under certain conditions, and we can be required to no longer process your Personal Information. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your Personal Information will no longer be processed by us for such purposes. Such a right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of your Personal Information is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded. 

Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. Your rights and our responses will vary based on the circumstances of the request. If you choose to assert any of these rights under applicable law, we will respond within the time period prescribed by such law. You may also have the right to submit a complaint to your local supervisory authority if you are in the European Union, Switzerland, or United Kingdom.

In any event, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. To exercise your rights, please contact us as stated in the “Contact Information” section of this Privacy Policy.

**SECURITY & RETENTION**

We have implemented generally accepted standards of technical and organizational security to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. All employees are required to keep Personal Information confidential and only authorized personnel have access to this information. Despite these protections, however, we cannot guarantee the safety of your Personal Information. In case there is unauthorized access to or use of your Personal Information, we may notify you of such access or use, including by electronic means if permitted by law.

We will keep your Personal Information for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your Personal Information for a period of time that enables us to:

* Maintain business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;
* Comply with record retention requirements;
* Defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims;
* Deal with any queries or complaints you may have; and
* Comply with any other relevant laws and regulations. 

We retain Personal Information for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

NCMEC generally does not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from children under the age of 13 (or other relevant age of majority). If you believe we have collected Personal Information from your child in error or have questions or concerns about our practices relating to children, please notify us using the details in the “Contact Information” section below. 

**THIRD PARTY LINKS**

Our Sites may contain links to websites, content, or services owned or operated by third parties. Please note, we have no control over the privacy practices of websites or services that we do not own.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party website or application for details about what information is collected and how it is used and/or disclosed. NCMEC assumes no liability for how third parties may collect and/or use your Personal Information.

**DATA TRANSFERS**

NCMEC is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations, entities, and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your Personal Information to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as those of your home jurisdiction.  We will take steps provide an adequate level of protection to your Personal Information in the jurisdictions in which we process it.  If you are located in the European Union, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, we transfer your Personal Information in accordance with applicable legal requirements, such as the derogations that permit transfers of Personal Information in limited circumstances (e.g., the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest or the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of a data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent) and/or through the use of other measures, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK Standard Contractual Clauses, or the UK Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices, technology, legal requirements, and other factors. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, they will become effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for the latest information on our information processing practices. To the extent that our Privacy Policy changes in a material way, we will notify you of the updated Privacy Policy to the extent required by applicable law.
