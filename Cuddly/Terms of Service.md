PURCHASES

If you purchase a gift at CUDDLY for a rescue animal, you are purchasing the price of the item selected plus any applicable taxes, handling and shipping charges. The gift is then ordered and shipped to the recipient animal rescue or shelter. 

CUDDLY may, in its sole discretion, choose to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances. This may occur, for example, when the product or service you wish to purchase is out of stock or has been mispriced, we suspect the request is fraudulent, or in other circumstances, CUDDLY deems appropriate in its sole discretion. CUDDLY also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity to process your order. CUDDLY will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.

CUDDLY accepts returns on certain merchandise on a case-by-case basis. For CUDDLY's Return Policy, which may change from time to time, please see https://www.CUDDLY.com/faq-page.

This fee covers the administrative costs to execute each order on behalf of our shelter/rescue partners, sales tax (when applicable in each state), shipping and handling expenses.

REVIEWS

CUDDLY may permit users to post reviews of certain Vendors on Vendor Profiles or other areas of the website. "Reviews" consist of opinions and information left by other users about Vendors. Reviews may include initial reviews from a user and responses from a Vendor. As our website is a neutral venue, we cannot, do not, and will not make any comments on behalf of any user. We do not make judgments on the veracity of opinions or statements. We may, but are not required to, take certain steps to ensure the Review is accurate, including proof that a user conducted business (or attempted to conduct business) with a Vendor. In order to protect the integrity of the Reviews, we will only consider removing a Review: (i) that contains profane, vulgar, discriminatory or adult material: (ii) for which we are provided with a binding ruling or settlement agreement from a valid and certified dispute resolution service, or is provided with a court order finding that the Review is slanderous, libelous, defamatory or otherwise illegal or the court order requires removal; (iii) that makes any reference to actions taken or purported to be taken by CUDDLY or any law enforcement organization; (iv) that violates these Terms; (v) from a user that cannot be verified by use; or (vi) if required by law. Vendors may contact us to initiate a dispute over a Review. As a Vendor, you agree that you will not: (a) attempt to restrict in any way a user's right to post a review, by contract or otherwise; (b) offer a user cash or other compensation in any form in exchange for a more favorable review; (c) post and/or cut and paste and/or copy the content of a review from the website to your own personal or business site, to any other third party website and/or to or on any of your own personal, business or third-party marketing/advertising materials, regardless of the form; (d) attempt to gain Reviews by receiving multiple Reviews from the same user; (e) post or attempt to post, in any manner or by any means, a Review on your own account; or (f) misrepresent or impersonate another user. You, as Vendor, agree and acknowledge that CUDDLY shall be entitled to retain all Reviews associated with you (including any of your responses) as well as basic directory information about you (e.g., business name, address and telephone number). Reviews about you will not be Your Content or your personal information. At your request, however, we will remove any other of Your Content (i.e., content that is not publicly available or included in reviews).

NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY

CUDDLY prohibits discrimination by Vendors or licensors against rescues, pet parents, donors, visitors, users, or any other party ("Protected Class") on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, physical characteristic, disability, marital status, family status or composition, pregnancy status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, political affiliation, veteran or citizenship status, age, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, regional, state, or local law ("Protected Characteristic"). Such discrimination includes, but is not limited to, doing any of the following: refusing to provide goods or services to, or accept goods or services from, a member of any Protected Class on the basis of a Protected Characteristic; submitting discriminatory content on the Website; imposing any different terms or conditions upon a member of any Protected Class on the basis of a Protected Characteristic; or any other conduct that improperly takes into account any Protected Characteristic. CUDDLY will take steps, in its sole discretion, to enforce this policy, up to and including the suspension from the Website of anyone who violates this policy. In addition, Vendors should make every effort to be welcoming to pet parents of all backgrounds. Vendors who, in CUDDLY's belief, demonstrate a pattern of refusing to provide goods or services to pet parents who are members of a protected class (even while articulating legitimate reasons) undermine the strength of our community and may be suspended in CUDDLY's sole discretion. If you experience discrimination from any pet parent, rescue, guest, Vendor, CUDDLY employee, licensor, visitor, or user of the Website, please contact support@CUDDLY.com, with the subject "Non-Discrimination Policy", so we can investigate and take appropriate measures.

You and CUDDLY further agree to the following with respect to the arbitration of any Dispute hereunder: (a) any claim must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding; (b) the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding and may not award class-wide relief; (c) the arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration; (d) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (e) each party will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, but we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the fees and costs of the arbitration; (f) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (g) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (h) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (i) each party will pay its own attorneys' fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys' fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.
