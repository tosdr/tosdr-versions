### **12\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

You have the right to:

**Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.  
**Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.  
**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  
**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.  
**Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.  
**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to form a contract with you.  
**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us as detailed below. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.  
  
  

### **13\. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

#### Personal Data We Collect about California Consumers

Additional Notice for California Consumers - This part of our Privacy Policy applies to consumers who reside in California. We have included this additional notice to give California consumers the disclosures that are required by California laws.

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other California laws use the term “personal information” to describe the personal data of California consumers. In this portion of our Privacy Policy, we use “personal information” for the sake of consistency with California laws, but personal information includes “personal data” as used elsewhere throughout the Privacy Policy.  
We describe the personal information we have collected from consumers in the twelve (12) months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy in Article 2 (Information We Collect and Receive) of our Privacy Policy. For more information, please see Article 2.

#### Disclosures of Personal Information for Monetary or Other Valuable Consideration or for Business Purposes

We do not sell consumers’ personal information in the sense that most people think of selling, but we do provide it to other companies that you should expect to interact with, such as your employer and those companies we have contracted with to help provide some part of our services, like marketing services providers and sponsors of events. The term, “sale,” is broadly defined in CCPA and includes any sharing of your personal information to a third party for consideration if the third party might use the information for their own purpose (such as in advertising or analytics). As is common practice among businesses that operate websites, we may have disclosed certain online identifiers, information about the use of our Site and inferences drawn about you to our social media, advertising and analytics partners for our marketing and related purposes. While we do not view these data sharing activities as “sales” under CCPA, if you wish to opt-out of our uses of personal information for these purposes, see your options under Article 12 (Your Legal Rights) and Article 13 (Contacting Busuu) in this Privacy Policy. We don't intend for our Site or Services to be used by anyone under 16 and therefore do not knowingly collect or disclose personal information of individuals under age 16. We have disclosed personal information in all or substantially all of the categories of personal information identified in this Privacy Policy for various business purposes. For more information about (A) the categories of personal information we have disclosed, see Article 2; (B) the categories of entities with which we have disclosed this information, see Article 7; and (C) the purposes for which we have disclosed and use the information, see Articles 2 and 3. Other articles in this Privacy Policy have relevant information about these categories, disclosures and uses as well.

#### Your California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have the following rights. We will honor requests received to the extent required by applicable law and within the time provided by law.

#### Right to Access and Information Regarding Personal Information:

You have the right to request that we disclose to you the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. Specifically, you have the right to request that we disclose the following to you, in each case in the twelve-month period preceding your request:

* The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information;
* The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information;
* The specific pieces of information we have collected about you;
* The categories of personal information about you, if any, that we have disclosed for monetary or other valuable consideration and the categories of third parties to which we have disclosed the information, by category or categories of personal information for each third party to which we disclosed the personal information; and
* The categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose.

If not already disclosed or provided by the disclosures in this Privacy Policy, we will deliver the personal information and information categories that we are required by law to disclose to you in the manner required by law within 45 days after receipt of a verifiable request, unless we notify you that we require additional time to respond, in which case we will respond within such additional period of time required by law. We may deliver such information to you through your account, if you maintain an account with us.

#### Right to Deletion of Personal Information:

See your right to request erasure of your personal information in Article 12.

#### Right to Opt Out:

You have the right to opt out of the disclosure of personal information about you for monetary or other valuable consideration. To Opt-Out, see the “Requests to Exercise Your Rights” section below.

#### Right to No Discrimination:

We may not discriminate against you because of your exercise of any of the foregoing rights under the CCPA. We may however, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by your personal information.

#### Requests to Exercise Your Rights:

If you are a California resident, you or your agent acting on your behalf may request to exercise the foregoing rights by:

* Submitting a request to us as directed in Article 14 (Contacting Busuu)

Please note that we may take steps to verify your or identity and, if applicable, your agent’s identity and authorization to act on your behalf, before granting you or your agent access to information or acting on your request to exercise your rights, as required or permitted by law. We may limit our response to your exercise of the above rights as permitted by law.

#### Data Sharing for Direct Marketing Purposes

If you are a California resident, you may ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or affiliates for those third parties or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes and identify the name and address of the third parties that received such personal information. We do not share this information with others for their direct marketing purposes.
