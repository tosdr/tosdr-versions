Fees are quoted and payable in Canadian dollars for Canadian related Applications and USD U.S. related Applications.
    * ApplyBoard may require you to pay an Application processing deposit depending on the country from which you are applying, other characteristics applicable to applicants, and the related likelihood of an Application being successful due to Governmental or Regulatory Authority visa approvals.

    * The foregoing will not limit ApplyBoard’s ability to exercise any rights available to it in law or equity respecting the collection of any amounts payable hereunder, and you will also be responsible for paying for all reasonable fees and costs incurred by ApplyBoard, including legal fees, in collecting any overdue amounts or enforcing any provision of this Agreement.
    * Without limiting the foregoing, ApplyBoard reserves the right not to process any Application or portion thereof prior to obtaining full payment of fees from you.
* **Interest on Late Payments**

    * If you are required to withhold any taxes from payments owed under this Agreement, the amount of payment due will automatically be increased to offset such tax, so that the amount actually remitted to ApplyBoard will equal the amount due.
