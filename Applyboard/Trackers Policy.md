ApplyBoard collects your personal data whenever you do any of the following and uses it as described:

**Create an Account:** To access certain features on the Website, you are required to create an account and provide your email address and password or sign in with Facebook or Google. Your login information is used to create your account, and otherwise provide and administer the service you requested.

**Explore What Programs You Are Eligible To Apply To:** You do not have to create an account to visit and browse certain features of our Website, such as to browse various schools and programs, read other content portions of the Website, or determine your eligibility for certain programs. If you choose to use our Website to discover programs you are eligible to apply for, we collect personal data such as your nationality, country of education, highest education, grading scheme, grade average, English/French exam score(s) and the disciplines or programs that you are interested in pursuing.

**Post On Our Website or Social Media Channels (including direct messages):** You have the ability to post information (e.g. questions, comments and opinions) through ApplyBoard’s services or on social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Instagram, as well as send us direct messages via these platforms. Please be advised that any personal data that you voluntarily post to any public forum will be available to other individuals and you should exercise caution when posting any personal data. Content you post on sites owned by third parties (such as social media platforms) is subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.

**Register to Take Any Courses:** You will have the ability to access our course content and provide voluntary personal data so we can register you as an individual taking the course. As a certificate of completion may be issued, we will keep a record of you having registered and/or completed the course offering.

**Interact with Live Chat and Online Support Services:** We provide online support services powered by third parties (e.g., Zendesk, Sendbird) on our Website, including a live chat functionality. These support services enable us, and the service providers we work with, to communicate instantly with you and to provide additional information or answer any questions.

Your information is collected with the aim of operating the online support services and analyzing the use of those services. It may include your first and last name, phone number, email address, IP address, and other data communicated while using the support services. In addition, the support services may collect browsing and usage data in the pages where they are installed, even if you do not actively use them. Live chat conversations may also be logged for quality assurance and training purposes.

By using the support services on our Website, you explicitly consent to the collection and use of your information. You are solely responsible for the information you choose to submit while using the support services.

**Purchase Products and Services Relating to the International Student Journey:** You have the ability to purchase products and services relating to the international student journey through our online store, which is hosted by Shopify. When you purchase a product or service through our online store, Shopify will collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, email address, phone number and payment information in order to assist us in completing your transaction, processing your payment, communicating with you about your purchase and arranging electronic delivery of your test voucher. We do not store credit card information entered through our online store; rather, Shopify, who is PCI DSS compliant, facilitates secure payment processing. By using our online store, you are subject to Shopify’s [Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy). Information that a user submits to our online store will be transmitted to and shared with third parties that may be located in countries outside the country in which the user resides, in order to provide services to the user, including but not limited to transaction processing and fraud prevention.

**Communicate with Us:** When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint, you may be asked for information that identifies you (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may also retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service, products, service offerings, events and promotions.

**Provide Information to Third Parties With Whom We Work:** We may obtain personal data about you through your legal representative, or a recruitment partner(s) or counsellor(s) who you are working with and who are using our services to process your application to schools. Occasionally, ApplyBoard will obtain information about you from third parties, such as mailing list providers and third-party service providers. Third-party providers are responsible for obtaining consent to provide personal data to us.

**Payment Processing and Transaction Tracking:** ApplyBoard uses, with your consent, third party PCI certified payment service providers including but not limited to Western Union, Flywire or Stripe. When you directly make a payment using these payment service providers, you are subject to their privacy policies. They are independent of ApplyBoard and ApplyBoard is not responsible for their privacy practices.

Our applications are designed to directly connect our users securely, transparently and cryptographically to the PCI certified payment processor. This helps ensure we maintain the privacy of your financial transactions. The payment processor provides ApplyBoard with a transaction number and status. This information is often required for visa applications as proof of program payment as well as a demonstration of student commitment to their selected program. ApplyBoard maintains a list of payment processors and other third party service providers that we may use to process payments to independent service providers and/or third party contractors that we retain in connection with delivery of the Services.

**Sign Up for Marketing Email and Other Communications:** We may offer you the ability to sign up to receive ApplyBoard marketing and promotional communications through the Website, on third party websites (including through social media sites), or educational events and information sessions. In these circumstances, we collect certain personal data (such as first and last name, email address or mobile phone number) which we use to send you email and other communications containing ApplyBoard updates, tips, and other content that may be of interest to you. You can opt out of receiving promotional email from us by following the “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” instructions provided in your email or text message, or by contacting us as set out below. Please note that you may continue to receive messages from us regarding your application or other transactional and account-related electronic messages from us.

**Participate in Our Surveys and Customer Research:** From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys or other customer research. The information obtained through our surveys and customer research is used in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable format. We use this information to help us understand our customers and to enhance our product and service offerings, promotions, and events.

**Sign Up for Contests and Promotions:** When you participate in a contest or promotion, we may collect your name, address, phone number, email address, and other information you provide. We use this information to administer your participation in the contest or promotion. If non-identifiable data is used for research purposes, then the limitation of liability and indemnity clauses if any contained within the Terms and Conditions are waived with respect to any harms suffered or liabilities incurred as a result of any research activities.

**Improve our services and develop new products:** ApplyBoard uses information to improve our services and to develop new products, features, and technologies that benefit our users, our students, and our institutional partners.

**Apply for Employment at ApplyBoard:** In connection with a job application or related inquiry regarding potential employment with ApplyBoard, you may provide us with certain personal data about yourself (such as that contained in a resume, cover letter, or similar employment and education-related materials). We use this information for the purpose of processing and responding to your application for current and future career opportunities.

**Apply To Become an ApplyBoard Recruitment Partner:** In connection with applying to become a potential recruitment partner with ApplyBoard, you may provide us with certain personal data such as your first name, last name, address, email address, personal data about your education and employment background and banking data.

When Do We Share Your Information
---------------------------------

We share your personal data with third parties, including service providers, regulated institutions (e.g., financial institutions), affiliated entities, and business partners as set out in the table below.

In the section below, we also list the reasons why we share information.

**How and Why We Share Your Information**

| With whom we share your personal data | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Schools | We share the information in your application with the schools that you are applying to (either directly or through a third party on your behalf, within Canada or abroad). Once ApplyBoard has provided your information to these schools for your application for admittance, ApplyBoard does not have any control over the use of such information by these schools and recommends that you contact them directly if you have any questions about the manner in which your personal data is treated. |
| Service Providers | We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal data to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers such as cloud providers to [send our emails](#send-our-emails), [host the Website](#host-the-website) and data (including cloud providers) and operate certain of its features. Other service providers may assist us with the provision of the services, help us verify your identity, prevent, detect and protect against fraudulent activity or abuse of our services, conduct internal research and analytical assessments, [process your transactions](#host-the-website), maintain your account(s) and [provide you with customer care services](#provide-you-with-customer-care-services). These service providers include internet service providers, data and cyber security services, banks, financial institutions, payment processors, financial services providers, remote access services, service providers that help us verify your identity and help us comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; and our business, legal, tax, financial and other advisors, on a confidential basis. Your personal data may be maintained and processed by third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal data for their own marketing or other purposes. |
| Parties to and those involved in a business transaction with ApplyBoard | We may transfer any information we have about you as an asset in connection with a proposed or completed merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of ApplyBoard or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control. |
| Researchers | With your consent ApplyBoard uses your data internally for research and development to improve our existing products and services and/or create new features to serve you better. ApplyBoard also uses non-personal data (“Metadata”) for this same purpose. With your consent, we may share your personal data with third parties involved in research and development to improve our existing products and services and/or create new features to serve you better. Such third parties may include educational institutions, academics, and others in similar fields. |
| Lawyers, courts and law enforcement | ApplyBoard and our Canadian, US and other service providers may provide your personal data in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an organization in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law. We may also disclose personal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, to detect, suppress or prevent fraud, and to investigate or prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property. Where you have engaged a recruitment partner or counsellor to submit your application to ApplyBoard, we may be required for legal, regulatory and/or compliance purposes to contact you directly to confirm certain information provided in connection with your application process. |

If you do not want us to use your personal data for us to market to you, and/or to pass on to third parties for marketing purposes, please contact us through the various communication channels available, as listed under the Section titled “[Contact Us, Questions, Updating Your Info, Opting Out](#contact-us)” below. You will also be able to unsubscribe from any marketing emails sent to you by ApplyBoard using a link provided in such emails. We do **not** sell your personal data.

Where We Store Your Data
------------------------

All information you provide to us is stored in the servers of our cloud service providers. We take reasonable steps to ensure our service providers adhere to the security standards we apply to your information. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Our service providers’ servers are predominantly located in the USA, excluding the ApplyProof application which is hosted entirely in Canada. Many of our service providers are also located outside of Canada. While we use appropriate safeguards to keep your information secure, the laws in other places may differ from those in Canada and authorities in those jurisdictions may access your information in accordance with their local laws.

Safeguards
----------

ApplyBoard takes the safeguarding of your information very seriously. We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal data in our custody and control, including limiting access to our database to legitimate users and employing device encryption and version tracking.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

ApplyBoard promptly evaluates and responds to incidents that create suspicion of or indicate unauthorized access to or handling of personal data. If we become aware and determine that an incident involving personal data qualifies as a security breach leading to the unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure of personal data in our custody and control, we will notify you of such breach without undue delay. We will provide timely information relating to the breach as it becomes known or reasonably available to us and to the extent permitted by law.

Your Rights
-----------

You have certain rights relating to your personal data, subject to local data protection laws. [Appendix 1](#appendix-1) describes some of these rights in detail and explains how you can exercise them. Depending on the applicable laws, these rights may include the right to:

* Be informed of how your personal data is used, collected, or shared;
* Access your personal data;
* Correct or rectify inaccuracies;
* Erase your personal data (‘be forgotten’);
* Restrict our processing of your personal data;
* Obtain and reuse your personal data;
* Object to the processing of your personal data;
* Not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated-processing, including profiling;
* Withdraw your consent; and
* Right to report or complain.

You may access, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal data in our custody or control at any time, subject to limited exceptions prescribed by law. Simply log into your account, go to your account profile, and make the necessary changes.

You can also request access, corrections or updates other personal data in our records by contacting us as set out below. We may request certain personal data for the purposes of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to their personal data records.

You may request your data be withdrawn (forgotten); this type of request can be performed assuming ApplyBoard is in a legal position to fulfill such a request. You must not have an active study application where financial or billing records are or may be in process should an application to a third-party service be engaged. Should ApplyBoard be able to comply with your request, only the personal data you provided will be forgotten. Non-personal data (“Metadata”) will be maintained regardless.

Should you wish to lodge a concern or complaint to ApplyBoard, please contact us as set out below. We will respond to your concerns in a reasonable time, typically within 10 business days.

Please note that these rights are not absolute. In some cases, we may refuse a request to exercise particular rights if complying with it means that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations and provide our Services to you. We will keep you informed as to the actions that we can take when you make your request.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our third-party service providers and recommend that you review their privacy policies carefully. We may communicate with our third-party service providers, to the extent permitted by law, when you make a request based on your personal data rights that involves the data collected by our third-party service providers. We will keep you informed on the status of your request in such cases.

Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
--------------------------------------------

We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms (including tracking technologies designed for mobile applications) to track information about your use of our Website and Services. We may combine this information with other personal data we collect from you (and our third-party service providers may do so on our behalf).

| **Functionality cookies.** | These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Website. They enable the personalization of content, recognition of users, and also remember your user preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). |
| **Targeting cookies.** | These cookies record your visit to our Website, the individual pages visited, and the links followed. If the cookie is set by a third party (for example, an advertising network) which also monitors traffic on other websites, this type of cookie may also be used to track your movements across different websites and to create profiles of your general online behavior. Information collected by tracking cookies is commonly used to target online advertising. |

The four types of cookies above will be either session cookies or persistent cookies.

* **Session Cookies.** Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Website or Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Website or Services.
* **Persistent Cookies.** Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to remember your user information, preferences and activity, to enable us to provide our services to you when you next return to our Website or Services. We also use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.

**HTML5 Storage.** We may also store your user information and Website preferences locally within your web browser via HTML5.

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website or Services to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website and Services usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

**Changing or Disabling your Cookie Settings.** Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Website who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Website; however, most site features will not function if you disable cookies and you will not be able to login to use our services. You can withdraw consent to the placement of cookies at any time by accessing the Privacy Preference Centre on our Website under “Cookies Settings”. However, please note that in order to delete all cookies across all your devices you will need to separately adjust your cookie settings for each device.

Disabling/Enabling Cookies Via Your Browser
-------------------------------------------

**Do Not Track.** Currently, our systems do not honor browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling Cookies); you also may opt-out of [Third Party Analytics](#third-party-analytics) or targeted advertising by following the instructions in the [Third Party Ad Networks](#third-party-ad-networks) section below.

**Social Media:** We may offer you the opportunity to engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins, and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the website, plug-in or application. When you provide information from your social media account, we may use this information to personalize your experience on the Website and on the third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, and to provide you with other products or services you may request.

**Links to Other Websites:** Our Website may contain links to other websites that ApplyBoard does not own or operate, including the websites of third-party partners. Also, links to our Website may be featured on third party websites on which we advertise. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your consent. We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal information.

Third-Party Analytics
---------------------

ApplyBoard uses the web analytics services from Google Analytics, Hubspot, Walkme, Hellobar, OneTrust, Mixpanel and Freshpaint to collect standard internet log information. Tools such as these may use cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Website. For example, with Google Analytics, the information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server. Google uses this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators, and providing Website operators with other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Website and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.).

You can also obtain additional information on Google Analytics’ collection and processing of data and data privacy and security at the following links: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and [https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

ApplyBoard also uses Google OCR, “Optical Character Recognition” service to convert your uploaded images into text for data import into your selected ApplyBoard’s applications for the sole purpose of eliminating processing errors in your selected program application while decreasing processing times.

Third-Party Ad Networks
-----------------------

We use third parties, such as network advertisers and other marketing agents, to display advertisements on our Website, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Website and unrelated third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your use of our Website and our Services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Website and users of our Service.

**Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising:** For more information about interest-based advertising and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from third-party advertising companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at http://youradchoices.ca/choices.

* Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.
* To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you will need to opt-out again.

**Custom Audience:** We may also use services provided by third-party platforms (such as social networking and other websites) to serve targeted advertisements on such platforms to you or others, and we may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider for such purposes. To opt out of the use of your information for such purposes, please contact us at [info@applyboard.com](mailto:info@applyboard.com).

Data Retention
--------------

ApplyBoard will only retain your personal data while it is needed to fulfill the intended purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise permitted or required by law or contract (which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you).

Typically, personal data is maintained during the time you are engaged in the institutional program you applied to, or for up to a year following our last contact with you. We may retain certain data as necessary for:

* legitimate business purposes, such as auditing, account recovery;
* if required by applicable federal, state, provincial or other laws;
* to prevent fraud or future abuse, or
* by contract with a partner and/or institution.

All retained personal data is treated in accordance with this Policy.

If you request that your personal data be removed from our databases and/or systems, it may not be possible to completely delete all your personal data due to technological and legal constraints. However, we will take such steps as are reasonable to securely destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de‑identified and/or anonymized as necessary.  
Should you request additional services from ApplyBoard which are subject to this Policy, you will be authorizing the extension of the data collection and/or processing purpose as a result.

ApplyProof
----------

ApplyProof is an online solution that facilitates the validation (“proofing”), accessing and verification of documents between students, schools, institutions, partners, third parties, and immigration officials. Documents that may be verified and validated through ApplyProof include but are not limited to letters of acceptance, language test scores, tuition payment, guaranteed investment certificates, arrival preparation documents, etc.

Although this Policy applies to both ApplyBoard and ApplyProof collectively, this section of the Policy describes how ApplyProof processes your data. Please note that if you use ApplyProof, you will also be subject to applicable ApplyProof terms and conditions.

When We Collect Your Information and How We Use It
--------------------------------------------------

ApplyProof collects and uses different types of personal data from Originator Users (i.e., schools, partners, third parties or other institutions) and Recipient Users (i.e., students and/or immigration officials) when they engage in the activities described below.

**Use the ApplyProof Service for Document Verification:** Originator Users and Recipient Users may have the option to use the ApplyProof Website, ApplyProof TrustHub, or other ApplyProof products to quickly access and verify documents. The document verification platform helps Originator Users and Recipient Users verify the authenticity and validity of certain documents, for a variety of uses. These uses include streamlining study permit VISA applications to validating student eligibility for education programs.

**Use ApplyProof Service for Document Validation:** Originator Users and Recipient Users may also use ApplyProof to validate or “proof” documents. ApplyProof enables the validation of a document that makes it verifiable on ApplyProof through a unique document ID and passcode. The document validation platform helps Originator Users and Recipient Users issue verifiable documents, manage validated documents and communicate with the recipients of the documents.

**Install Browser Extensions:** You may have the option to install extensions to improve and customize your product experience. Extensions can be downloaded from official web stores, such as the Chrome Web Store. If you choose to install the browser extensions we offer, you authorize us to store certain information. For example, if you install the ApplyProof TrustHub, we will store your ApplyProof login credentials, including the email address or username and password that you used to create an account with us. We may collect anonymized information about your activity on the browser extensions (e.g., usage frequency and duration) through the use of cookies to improve the product and enhance your experience.

ApplyProof data is securely stored in Canada. ApplyProof’s cloud service is separate from ApplyBoard’s servers. All Personal Information and student data is secured by ApplyProof for the purpose of supporting the student’s educational and immigration journey. Personal Information is not used by ApplyProof or ApplyBoard for the recruitment of students. Users of ApplyProof’s Document Validation Service, such as institutions/partners or other key service providers to students, maintain responsibility for document content and consent collection.

Data Retention
--------------

ApplyProof document(s) will be retained for as long as they are needed for the intended purpose, or as required by law or contract (which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you).

The entity, student or institutional partner which has uploaded the document(s) for certification or verification may request premature deletion of uploaded files. This is most likely to occur in the case where a content correction or update is required.

**WHEN DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?**

The table headed “_**How and Why We Share Your Information**_” in the main part of the Policy under the heading “[WHEN DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION](#when-do-we-share-your-info)” lists who we may share your information with, which include transfers for reasons of legal compliance and necessity in order to provide you with our Services.

You should be aware that when sharing your information, it may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA or the UK, as applicable.

Please note that where data is transferred outside of the EEA, non-EEA countries may not offer the same level of protection for personal data as is available in the EEA. ApplyBoard will take various measures to ensure that your data is treated securely, which may include, but not be limited to:

* assessing the security measures taken at any place your personal data is transferred to;
* having suitable contract terms in place that oblige a data processor to only process in accordance with our instructions;
* having monitoring, reporting and resolution procedures in place with regard to ongoing security; and
* only transferring your data via an appropriate safeguard as described in Article 46 of GDPR, including Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission (Article 46.2)

Please contact us at [DPO@ApplyBoard.com](mailto:DPO@ApplyBoard.com). if you require more detailed information about international transfers of your personal data, and the particular safeguards used.

**LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We process your personal data based on the following legal bases, as recognised by and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws:

* the processing is necessary to perform our contract with you (i.e. the Terms and Conditions that apply as applicable with respect to ApplyBoard Services, for the provision of our Services), or to take steps requested by you before entering into said contract;
* you are obliged to provide us with personal data as it is necessary to enter into and perform our contractual agreements. In the event that you do not wish to provide us with your personal data for the purposes outlined above in the “How and why we use your information” section, we will not be able to perform our contractual agreement with you;
* the processing is in ApplyBoard’s or someone else’s legitimate interests, and these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in the protection of your personal data. This may include processing your data for prevention of fraudulent activity, internal research and analytics assessments, for purposes of communication with you, and informing you about new products and services we are offering or to promote new products and services of other parties which we think may be of interest to you, etc.;
* before we process your personal data to pursue our legitimate interests for the purposes outlined above in the “How and why we use your information” section, we determine if such processing is necessary and we carefully consider the impact of our processing activities on your fundamental rights and freedoms. On balance, we have determined that such processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and that the processing which we conduct does not adversely impact on these rights and freedoms.
* you have given your consent to the processing of your data;
* the processing is necessary to meet a legal obligation which applies to ApplyBoard

Sometimes we process data about you which the law considers to fall within special categories (see section “What data do we process about you?” for more details), in which case, we use one of the following grounds:

* the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
* you have freely given your informed, specific consent to the processing; or
* the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on applicable law.

If you would like more information about the legal grounds used to process your information, or about the legitimate interests referred to above, please contact us.

In cases where we have asked for, and you have given, your consent to our processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time. You can do this by contacting our DPO at [DPO@ApplyBoard.com](mailto:DPO@ApplyBoard.com).

**DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE US YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, you will not be able to use our Services. For example, we need details such as your name, address and bank account details so that we can make payments to you and receive payments from you. In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our Website).

**PROFILING AND AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING**

We use automated decision making as part of the ApplyBoard Services. We use these tools as a measure of fraud prevention and for purposes of security and risk assessment relating to the performance of the ApplyBoard Services:

1. Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of your application: based on the information you provided, the tool may advise if additional information is required for the purpose of approval of your application.
2. Automated tools incorporated in our process of approval of certain schools or programs of: such tools may advise if additional information is required for the purpose of eligibility or determine eligibility.

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?**

ApplyBoard will only retain your personal data while it is needed to fulfill the intended purpose for which it was collected or as otherwise permitted or required by law or contract (which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you).

Typically, personal data is maintained during the time you are engaged in the institutional program you applied to, or for up to a year following our last contact with you. We may retain certain data as necessary for:

* legitimate business purposes, such as auditing, account recovery;  
    if required by applicable federal, state, provincial or other laws;
* to prevent fraud or future abuse, or
* by contract with a partner and/or institution.

All retained personal data is treated in accordance with this Policy.

If you request that your personal data be removed from our databases and/or systems, it may not be possible to completely delete all your personal data due to technological and legal constraints. However, we will take such steps as are reasonable to securely destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de‑identified and/or anonymized as necessary.

Should you request additional services from ApplyBoard which are subject to this Policy, you will be authorizing the extension of the data collection and/or processing purpose as a result.

ApplyProof document(s) will be retained for as long as they are needed for the intended purpose, or as required by law or contract (which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you).

The entity, student or institutional partner which has uploaded the document(s) for verification may request premature deletion of uploaded files. This is most likely to occur in the case where a content correction or update is required.

**YOUR RIGHTS UNDER GDPR**

You have several rights in relation to your personal data which are described in more detail below. You can exercise your rights at any time by contacting us at [DPO@ApplyBoard.com](mailto:DPO@ApplyBoard.com).

Accessing your data
-------------------

You can ask us to:

* Confirm whether we are processing your personal data.
* Give you a copy of that personal data.
* Provide you with other information about your personal data such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it outside of the EEA and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we carry out any automated decision making or profiling. We aim to give you all this information in this Policy, although if anything is unclear, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [DPO@ApplyBoard.com](mailto:DPO@ApplyBoard.com).

You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your personal data unless your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances. We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.

Correcting your personal data
-----------------------------

You can ask us to correct any personal data which is inaccurate or incomplete (in most cases you will be able to make these changes yourself by logging into your account). This is free of charge.

If we have shared the personal data with anyone else, we will tell them about the correction wherever possible.

If we cannot action a request to correct your personal data, we will let you know and explain why this is.

Erasing your personal data
--------------------------

This right is sometimes referred to as “the right to be forgotten”. This is not an absolute right but you have the right to have your data erased, free of charge, in certain circumstances.

You can ask for your personal data to be erased where:

* it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed;
* we are processing your personal data based on your consent, and you withdraw that consent;
* you object to the processing of your personal data and we do not have an overriding legitimate interest for continuing;
* it has been unlawfully processed;
* it must be erased to comply with a legal obligation;
* it was processed to offer information society services to a child.

There are some exceptions to this right. If one of these applies, we do not have to delete the personal data.

If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will tell them about the erasure of your data unless this is impossible or would involve disproportionate effort.

Please note, in connection with such requests, that personal data may be either deleted or retained in an aggregated manner without being linked to any identifiers or personal data, depending on technical commercial capability.

Restricting the processing of your personal data
------------------------------------------------

You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in some circumstances, free of charge. This is not an absolute right. If processing is restricted we can store the personal data and retain enough information to make sure the restriction is respected unless you consent or the processing is necessary in relation to a legal claim or to protect the rights of another person or for reasons of important public interest, but we cannot further process your personal data.

You can restrict the processing of your personal data in the following cases:

* if you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing until we have made sure the personal data is accurate;
* if you object to our processing pending the verification of whether or not our legitimate interests override your interests, rights and freedoms or in connection with legal proceedings;
* if the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your personal data;
* if we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.

If we have disclosed the data to a third party, we will inform them about the restriction unless it is impossible or would require a disproportionate effort. We will tell you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing your personal data.

Objecting to the processing of your personal data
-------------------------------------------------

You have a right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time. This request will be free of charge. It is not an absolute right, but you can object to our processing of your personal data where it is:

* based on the legitimate interest ground; or
* for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.

We will stop processing your personal data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or unless we are processing the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

You can require us to stop using your personal data for direct marketing purposes. We will stop as soon as we receive your request, however we may not be able to implement this for any direct marketing campaigns which are already in progress. There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.

Data Portability
----------------

This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. It applies where the following conditions are met:

* you provided the personal data to us yourself;
* we are processing the personal data either based on your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract; and
* the processing is carried out by automated means.

We will provide your personal data free of charge in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form.

Automated decision making and profiling
---------------------------------------

You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing and which produces a legal (or similarly significant) effect on you.

We will tell you about any automated decision making that affects you. You have the right to:

* request human intervention;
* express your point of view;
* ask for the decision to be explained; and
* challenge the decision.

These rights are not absolute. We may not be able to comply with this request if the processing of personal data is:

* necessary for us to enter into or perform a contract with you;
* authorised by law (e.g. for fraud prevention) and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your right, freedoms and legitimate interests; or
* based on your explicit consent.

Dealing with requests to exercise your rights
---------------------------------------------

We will respond to your request without undue delay at the latest within one (1) month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we may extend this by two (2) months. We will let you know if we are going to take longer than one (1) month in dealing with your request. If we have a lot of information about you we might ask you if you can tell us what exactly you want to receive. This will help us action your request more quickly.

For the purpose of complying with your requests to exercise the rights listed above, we shall perform the necessary internal processes to identify you.
