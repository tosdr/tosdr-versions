Registration Terms
==================

Thank you for becoming a member of the Grieving.com community. Most of our members are here because they need to find support and empowerment on their journey. We are a community made up of people from over 100 countries and all walks of life. All members must abide by the following guidelines.

GUIDELINES

Grieving.com wants to provide a forum where people can find support and empowerment on their grief journeys. To enable a safe, compassionate environment, we ask you to follow the rules of **CARE:** Create, Allow, Respect, and Empathize.

Create a caring environment by

* respecting the original author's post.
* responsibly sourcing information from a third party by linking to the original site.
* avoiding spamming or advertising on the site without permission.
* posting in the appropriate forum, by topic.

Allow fellow posters their individuality by

* understanding that English may not be a poster's first language.
* accepting that each person's grief journey is unique.
* never discriminating based upon beliefs, race, gender, culture, or sexual identity.

Respect one another and Grieving.com by

* never stalking, harassing, or threatening another grieving individual.
* never attempting to provide professional therapy for another member.
* keeping the anger associated with grief directed at outside sources, not fellow posters.

Empathize with one another by

* empowering one another instead of judging one another.
* giving those in need access to tools such as the suicide hotline.
* acknowledging that we are all equal in our grief.

Additionally:

* Religious/afterlife discussion:  Comments and discussion of this nature are welcome, but should only be made here: [https://forums.grieving.com/forum/7-spiritualreligious-beliefs](https://forums.grieving.com/forum/7-spiritualreligious-beliefs). Such comments made elsewhere will be removed as there are people of all beliefs here and they mostly come here for general support and sharing vs religious discussion; such discussion elsewhere may make them uncomfortable. 
* Political discussion: Political remarks and discussions are not permitted on the site. There are plenty of other places on the internet to do so if you wish!  
     
* Medical advice: Members are not permitted to dispense advice or suggestions about health, medical treatments, etc on this site. Any such comments should be restricted to one's own beliefs about such things, making it clear it is only their experience or opinion and not universally accepted fact.

  
We all care for each other here. If a poster steps outside these guidelines, consequences including warnings, suspensions, or banning may be necessary to ensure continued compassion within the community.
