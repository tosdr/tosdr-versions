-----------------------------

Last Updated: 6 February 2024.

### 1\. Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for your conduct and any content/data sent to Webhook.site (hereafter known as "the Service").

#### 1.1 Requirements for Service Usage

Users of the Service are expected to use the Service responsibly and legally. Violation of this policy may result in immediate termination of your account and access to the Service, at our sole discretion.

1. Users must ensure responsible conduct and manage any content or data sent to Webhook.site with care.
2. The posting of illegal content, engaging in harassment, distributing malware, or conduct that is abusive, threatening, obscene, or defamatory is strictly prohibited.
3. You may not misuse our Services by interfering with normal operation, or attempting to access them using a method other than through the interfaces and instructions that we provide.
4. Using Webhook.site for any kind of _load testing_, _benchmarking_ or otherwise stressing the system deliberately is strictly prohibited.
5. You may not attempt to upgrade an account by any other means than through the official methods provided to you on the Service.
6. Unless authorized by Webhook.site, you may not use any manual or automated system to scrape the content or extract data of content on Webhook.site that does not belong to yourself or your company.

#### 1.2 Fair Use

The following Fair Use Policy is enforced on a per-case basis and is in place to prevent any URL from causing interference to the Service in general, as described in section 1.1. A URL, IP address or IP range may be blocked and blacklisted at any time (resulting in a HTTP 429 error being served at the URL) if the Fair Use Guidelines listed below are exceeded, or if Webhook.site determines the URL to be causing significant interference to other users of the Service. If possible, the owner of the URL will be contacted as part of the process.

Exceptions to the Fair Use Guidelines can be made, and if your usage is higher than listed in the Guidelines, we can whitelist your IP or Webhook.site URL. To request an exception, contact [Webhook.site Support.](https://support.webhook.site/)

Fair Use Guidelines apply to all subscription tiers.

##### 1.2.1 Fair Use Guidelines

Per account:

1. Amount of URLs/e-mail addresses (also known as Tokens) created per day: 100 (with the [expiry](https://docs.webhook.site/api/tokens.html#create-token) option set); 10 (no expiry)
2. Amount of incoming requests/e-mails created per minute: 1000

### 2\. Permission to Use

Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these terms, Webhook.site grants you limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable revocable permission to access the services and use the Service for use during the Term at the level of service for which you have paid all applicable Fees.

### 3\. Paid Subscriptions

Webhook.site provides different types of paid subscriptions. These subscriptions provide extra features as well as removal of some limitations for the URLs associated with the accounts.

A user, and the URLs associated with the users' account, will retain the upgraded status as long as their subscription is valid and their current payment period has been paid.

If the user cancels their subscription, the upgrade remains valid until the end of the subscription period.

If the payment is repeatedly rejected, the user is notified through the payment provider, and the URLs associated will lose the upgrade at that time and Webhook.site will automatically cancel the subscription.

A list of features are listed [in the documentation.](https://docs.webhook.site/pro.html)

#### 3.1 Refunds

A full refund of a subscription period can be issued at most 14 days after creating the subscription and requires a reason. To request a refund, contact [Webhook.site Support](https://support.webhook.site/).

### 4\. Service Responsibilities

#### 4.1 Uptime and Availability

The Service does not provide any guarantee of the availability, response time, uptime, throughput or any other kind of connectivity to the Service.

#### 4.2 Data Storage

For Webhook.site URLs not belonging to a Webhook.site account, or a Webhook.site account with a cancelled subscription, data may be automatically deleted after 7 days.

For Webhook.site URLs belonging to a Webhook.site account with a paid subscription, data may be automatically deleted after a maximum of one year (365 days).

Additionally, a maximum of 10000 requests or emails can be stored at any given URL, after which, the oldest data is periodically purged.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.

### 11\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

### 12\. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.
