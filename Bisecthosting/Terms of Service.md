* CPU intensive servers may be suspended without warning to prevent causing any issues to other clients. You will be notified of this and will give you as much advice possible to get your server using a reasonable amount of CPU resources.
* Disk space for budget and premium servers is unlimited based on fair-usage for the node you are on.

Your storage allowance is only to be used for your Minecraft server, any unrelated items that are stored on your server may be deleted.
* For Unlimited storage packages, the space you are allocated is based on Fair Usage. We will contact you if you do use an unreasonable amount of space.
* Very Large dynmaps, logs and backups may be deleted if they take up a considerable amount of space which can potentially cause issues on the node.
