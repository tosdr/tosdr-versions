* User profile: the following fields in your user profile are optional and are intended to allow you to personalize your public user profile on Ulule: last name, first name, city, description, full description, social networks and websites.  Completing this information could make you reveal private and sometimes sensitive or very personal information about yourself (religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, health status, etc.).

Once the comment or forum post form is validated, this sensitive information will become publicly visible to everyone. Ulule therefore urges you to protect your privacy by carefully selecting the information used when publishing any comments or posts on project pages, news and/or on our forum.
    

### **Third party data**

When writing a project presentation or a news item, you may have to communicate to us and to the public information concerning third parties (your collaborators, a person whom your project aims to help, etc.).
