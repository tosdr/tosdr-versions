Use of the site that is fraudulent, or that violates these General Terms and Conditions, will justify that access to the Services or other functionalities of the Site be denied to the User, at any time.

Article 3. Conditions Applicable to Creators
============================================

3.1 Nature of Services Offered to Creators
------------------------------------------

The Site allows Users who wish to collect funds by creating one or more fundraising pages.

The Company acts as a technical intermediary by providing the Creator with an online platform allowing him to create, broadcast, and promote his Fundraiser on a dedicated internet page.

3.2 Presentation of Fundraisers
-------------------------------

Creators who wish to promote their Fundraisers and obtain financing, submit to the Company, for publication on the Site, a presentation detailing the purpose, nature, and objectives of the fundraising they wish to undertake.

To be accepted by the Company for online publication on the Site, the Creator commits to providing a clear and precise description of the Fundraiser project.

Several fundraising modes are possible on the Site. If he has chosen to conduct a Fundraiser with Rewards, he must also provide the minimum amount that must be reached for the Fundraiser to be considered funded, the Collection Period, and the Rewards he offers.

The characteristics and parameters of the Fundraisers are subject to prior acceptance by the Company without obligation to motivate its refusal, and without this resulting in a guarantee for the User regarding the commitments of the Creator, or the authenticity of the information presented by the Creator. Indeed, the review of Fundraiser presentations primarily aims to verify the coherence and quality of presentation of the information provided, and is not intended to control the viability of the Creators' commitments, the feasibility of their objectives, or the authenticity of the information provided.

For example, the Company will systematically refuse Fundraisers that are fanciful, lacking seriousness, detached from any concrete reality, and doomed to failure.

It is the Creator's responsibility to ensure that he has all the necessary rights to publish the Fundraiser on the Site and that he complies with all applicable laws and regulations related to his commitments, both concerning the possible Rewards he offers and concerning the use he indicates he wants to make of the collected funds. In particular, Creators are prohibited from bringing Fundraisers into violation with current laws and regulations, which could harm human dignity or a person's privacy, the protection of third parties' personal data (see in particular Ulule's Privacy Policy), contrary to good morals, or inciting or leading to illegal activity or any other activity that would infringe on the rights of the Company and its co-contractors, other Users, and, more generally, any third party.

The Creator is fully responsible for the content of the Fundraiser presentation published on the Site and must ensure in particular that this presentation cannot mislead Users.

The Creator acknowledges that providing misleading, incomplete, or erroneous information is likely to engage his liability against the Company and Users and assumes full responsibility for the consequences resulting from any omission or negligence in this regard.

In case of death, incapacity, accident of the Creator, or any other event placing him in the incapacity to fulfill the commitments made in connection with a Fundraiser (Reward promised to Users or use of the collected money to do something specific), the Company is authorized to suspend the ongoing collection.

More generally, the Company may discretionarily cancel an ongoing collection as soon as it is noted that the Creator violates these presents. In this case, all registered Contributions would be immediately canceled, the concerned Users refunded, and the Creator could not claim to recover the collected sums.

Creators acknowledge being firmly determined to implement all means to fulfill the commitments they make through the site's mediation, whether concerning the possible Rewards promised or the indicated use of the collected funds. They commit to regularly update their Fundraiser pages and to share with other Users information concerning the progress of their commitments, even after the expiration of the Collection Period.

3.3 Reputation Safeguard Clause
-------------------------------

Ulule reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to evaluate any Fundraiser or Content that could potentially lead to significant public backlash, harm the reputation of the Site, the Company, its Users, Creators, partners, and stakeholders, or violate the values and ethical principles promoted by the Site, which include, but are not limited to:

* diversity: valuing and including people from different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, and physical or mental abilities;
    
* gender equality: fighting gender inequalities and promoting equal rights, opportunities, and treatment for men, women, and non-binary people;
    
* inclusion: creating spaces, opportunities, and communities where everyone feels respected and valued;
    
* social justice: striving to create an equitable society where rights and opportunities are justly distributed across society, including for historically marginalized or oppressed groups;
    
* environmental awareness: recognizing the climate emergency and promoting sustainable practices to protect the environment for future generations;
    
* minority rights: protecting and promoting the rights of minority groups, including ethnic, religious, cultural, sexual, and gender minorities;
    
* fighting xenophobia: actively engaging in combating fear, distrust, or hatred towards foreigners or anything perceived as foreign or different;
    
* accessibility: improving access and participation in physical, digital, and social spaces for people with disabilities;
    
* corporate social responsibility: the belief that companies should be accountable not only to their shareholders but also to their employees, customers, society at large, and the environment;
    
* fighting gender-based and sexual violence: ongoing efforts to eliminate discrimination and violence based on sex or gender;
    
* combating cyberbullying: actions aimed at preventing and fighting online harassment, to create safe and respectful digital spaces for all users;
    

Any Creator of a Fundraiser or Content that may cause significant public backlash, harm the reputation of Ulule, its Users or Creators, or violate the ethical values and principles promoted by Ulule, whether due to the nature of the Fundraiser, or the beneficiaries or individuals associated with it, must, before launching the Fundraiser or publishing the Content, disclose this risk to the Company by indicating it in the discussion thread with the Ulule team.

If, once a Fundraiser is launched, or Content is published, Ulule identifies such a risk, which has not been indicated by the Creator prior to the launch of the Fundraiser or the publication of said Content, Ulule will notify the creator of the collection and propose corrective actions, which may include, without limitation, modifying the content of the Fundraiser, stopping the Fundraiser early, or outright canceling the Fundraiser with a refund of the amounts committed by Users for their Contributions.

If the corrective actions proposed are not implemented by the Creator within 48 hours, or if the nature of the Fundraiser is such that corrective actions cannot remedy the potential damages, the Company reserves the right to unilaterally stop the Fundraiser, either by early termination of the Fundraiser or by outright cancellation of the Fundraiser with a refund of the amounts committed by Users for their Contributions, without prejudice to any other right or recourse.

Except in cases of emergency or proven damage, the early termination of a Fundraiser by the Company under this clause will be preceded by a new 48-hour notice addressed to the Creator by electronic communication.

The Creator acknowledges that the termination of a Fundraiser under this clause, whether by reducing its duration or canceling it outright, does not entitle them to any compensation.

3.4 Promotion on the Site and Outside the Site
----------------------------------------------

As part of managing Fundraisers and the Company's marketing operations, the Company is led to promote Fundraisers, Services, the Site, and/or the Company.

The Creator agrees hereby that the content and information provided may be freely used by the Company for promotional purposes.

Thus, the Creator grants the Company, exclusively, free of charge, worldwide and for the entire duration of these presents, the rights as specified below, to allow the Company to provide the Service in the form of broadcasting on the Internet, on mobile telephony networks, and/or on any other current public communication network.

To this end, the Creator grants the Company, the right, in particular:

* to use, as part of its communication and promotion of the Site, its name as well as the name and characteristics of the Fundraiser;
    
* the right to reproduce and have reproduced the content and information provided on the Site on any network, by any process, in any form known or unknown, in association or not with other works of any nature as long as these exploitations are carried out in connection with the promotion of the Fundraiser;
    
* to represent or have represented all or part of the content of the Fundraiser;
    
* to adapt or have adapted all or part of the content of the Fundraiser.
    

The Creator also expressly authorizes the Company to ensure the promotion and/or advertising of the Fundraiser, and to broadcast with the content advertising, commercial, and/or promotional messages relating to third-party products or services.

The Creator also expressly accepts that the content and information provided be exploited on the Site with the presence of brands or logos of the Company's partners.

3.5 Fulfillment of Creators' Commitments
----------------------------------------

The Creator commits to fulfilling the commitments made to Users, in particular to use the collected funds in accordance with the description of his Fundraiser, and, if he has offered Rewards, to provide the Rewards described on the Fundraiser page.

When offering Rewards, the Creator is encouraged to ensure that he will be able to provide the Rewards he proposes to Users at the end of the Fundraiser. Rewards can be of any nature other than financial (personal creations, content, objects, invitation to an event, etc.).

Creators commit not to propose or provide any illicit Rewards, in particular of a sexual, racist, discriminatory, defamatory, abusive, xenophobic nature, inciting to violence, violating the image of third parties, infringing on public order or good morals, contrary to laws, violating professional secrecy, property, and trademark rights, patents, or any other intellectual or industrial creation belonging to third parties, dangerous or counterfeit.

In case the Creator cannot reward Users with the promised Rewards, he expressly commits to refunding them in full and accepts that the Company cannot assist him in this process.

The Creator expressly acknowledges that he is solely responsible for the administrative, accounting, fiscal, and social management related to the Fundraiser, including the amounts received through the Company, and their fiscal qualification.

The Company is not responsible for the actions of Creators who remain solely responsible for the terms that bind them with Users in the context of fundraising Contributions through the Site's mediation. Creators are responsible for the Contributions they receive through the Site's mediation and the possible Rewards they offer in the context of Fundraisers presented on the Site.

Consequently, the risks involved in the development and execution of projects realized with the collected funds, such as possible delays or cancellations, lie entirely and exclusively with the Creators.

Creators may organize refunds at their sole discretion. The Company is not responsible for refunds that occur on Fundraisers without passing through the platform.

Article 4. Conditions Applicable to Collection and Tracking of Contributions
============================================================================

4.1 Collection of Contributions
-------------------------------

Users are entirely free to choose the amount and allocation of their Contributions.

For Fundraisers offering Rewards, Users freely choose the Reward they wish to receive among those offered by the Creator, provided that the amount of the Contribution made is equal to or greater than the value of the chosen Reward.

By accepting the terms of this contract, the User declares that the source of funds used by him on the Site is not illegal and commits not to use it for any illegal or fraudulent activity, including money laundering.

It is reminded here that the Company is only an intermediary between the Creator and the User in the promotion of a Fundraiser, by providing the Creator and the User with its Services and the Site.

Consequently, the User cannot seek the Company's liability in case of the Creator's failure, whether this failure concerns a delay in delivering the Rewards, a cancellation or inability to use the collected funds according to the purpose of the Fundraiser, for any reason, or a non-delivery of the Rewards, or one or more Rewards not conforming to the description given by the Creator.

4.2 Payment of Contributions by Users
-------------------------------------

It is specified that the Company does not charge commissions from Users on collected Contributions. Indeed, the commissions that the Company deducts are charged to Creators only.

The payment of the Contribution will be made using one of the payment methods offered on the Site, which may be, for example, credit card and/or any other payment method already proposed on the Site or that will be integrated into the service in the future.

When Users make a Contribution on a Fundraiser or when Creators publish a Fundraiser, they accept the terms of use of the payment systems used on the Site.

For payment and fundraising flows in euros: the Company has chosen to trust Mangopay SA through the Mangopay solution for all monetary payment services denominated in euros. By using the payment system offered on the Site to make a payment in euros or collect funds in euros, Users and Creators therefore accept the terms of use of Mangopay which are annexed to these presents and are an integral part of the general terms of use of the Ulule Site.

For payment and fundraising flows in a currency other than the euro: payments and fundraising denominated in a currency other than the euro are carried out using the Stripe Connect payment system. By using the payment system offered on the Site to make a payment or collect funds in a currency other than the euro, Users and Creators therefore accept the terms of use of Stripe Connect. The full terms of use of Stripe Connect can be found here: https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms

4.3 Management of Contributions
-------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Fundraisers Operating in “Fundraiser with Rewards” Mode

#### 4.3.1.1 Payments by Credit Card via the Payment Service Provider Mangopay (payments in euros)

For payments made in euros, Ulule uses the services of the Payment Service Provider Mangopay. For these transactions, the Contribution is immediately debited from the User's bank account.

If the Contribution was made on a Fundraiser operating in Fundraiser with Rewards mode, the User can decide if he wishes to cancel his Contribution before the expiration date of the Collection Period. In this case, the amount of his Contribution is automatically re-credited to his bank account, an operation that takes on average 2 to 5 business days once the cancellation is confirmed.

If at the end of the Collection Period the Funding Goal has not been reached, the User's Contribution is then re-credited to his bank account.

If at the end of the Collection Period the Funding Goal has been reached or exceeded, the User's Contribution is transferred to the Creator's bank account and can no longer be refunded to the User who made the Contribution via the system set up by the Company and its partner Mangopay. In case of dispute or desire to be refunded, the User must then interact directly with the Creator.

#### 4.3.1.1 Payments by Credit Card via the Payment Service Provider Stripe (payments in a currency other than the euro)

For payments made in a currency other than in euros, Ulule uses the Payment Service Provider Stripe. For these transactions, the Contribution is not immediately debited from the User's account. A payment authorization is recorded, which will only be executed in case the Funding Goal is reached once the Collection Period is over.

If the Contribution was made on a Fundraiser operating in Fundraiser with Rewards mode, the User can decide if he wishes to cancel his Contribution before the expiration date of the Collection Period. In this case, the amount of his Contribution will never be debited.

If at the end of the Collection Period the Funding Goal has not been reached, the User's Contribution is not debited.

If at the end of the Collection Period the Funding Goal has been reached or exceeded, the User's Contribution is debited and transferred to the Creator's bank account and can no longer be refunded to the User who made the Contribution via the system set up by the Company and its service provider Stripe. In case of dispute or desire to be refunded, the User must then interact directly with the Creator.

### 4.3.2 Fundraisers Operating in “Donation Fundraiser” or “Subscription Fundraiser” Mode

For Fundraisers operating in “Donation Fundraiser” or “Subscription Fundraiser” mode, the Contribution by credit card is immediately debited from the Contributor's account and is immediately credited to the Collected Funds of the concerned Fundraiser, and can no longer be refunded to the Contributor, regardless of the Payment Service Provider used (Stripe or Mangopay)

If the User has opted for a monthly Contribution, he can manage this choice within his User space, in particular to suspend or stop his monthly Contribution. This action is only effective for future monthly installments and does not entail the cancellation of monthly installments already debited in the past, which remain acquired by the Creator.

In case of dispute or desire to be refunded, the User must interact directly with the Creator.

4.4 Commissions as Remuneration for the Mediation Service and Reversal of Collected Sums
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Access to the Site is free.

The Company applies a commission on the funds collected by Creators' Fundraisers. The payment of this commission is automatically deducted by the Company from the total amount collected through the Site.

For Fundraisers collecting in Fundraiser with Rewards mode, the commission on collected funds is due only for Fundraisers that have reached or exceeded their Funding Goal at the end of the Collection Period. It is charged at the time of transferring the Collected Funds.

For Fundraisers collecting in Donation Fundraiser or Subscription Fundraiser mode, the commission on collected funds is due regardless of the amount reached. It is charged at the time of transferring the Collected Funds.

The commission remunerating the Services provided by the Company is calculated as a percentage of the amount of Contributions collected by the mediation of the Site that are subject to a fund transfer. The applicable percentage varies according to the payment method and the volume of collected funds and the currency in which the funds are collected.

For Creators collecting funds in euros, the following pricing is applicable, calculated at each execution of a fund transfer, on the corresponding fund transfer amount:

* Tier ranging from €0 to €100,000 in collected funds: commission of 6.67% excl. VAT for funds collected by Credit Cards, and 4.17% excl. VAT for funds collected via offline contributions (such as wire transfers for example) added to the collection (checks or transfers);
    
* Tier ranging from €100,001 to €250,000 in collected funds: commission of 5.83% excl. VAT for funds collected by Credit Cards, and 3.33% excl. VAT for funds collected via offline contributions added to the collection (checks or transfers);
    
* Tier ranging from €250,001 to €500,000 in collected funds: commission of 5.00% excl. VAT for funds collected by Credit Cards, and 2.50% excl. VAT for funds collected via offline contributions added to the collection (checks or transfers);
    
* Funds collected beyond €500,000: commission of 4.17% excl. VAT for funds collected by Credit Cards, and 1.67% excl. VAT for funds collected via offline contributions added to the collection (checks or transfers);
    

Example of calculation:

A Fundraiser has collected €166,000 on Ulule, split into €112,000 collected by credit card and €54,000 collected via offline contributions added to the Collected Funds at the Creator's request.

The commission as remuneration for the Mediation Service is calculated as follows:

All funds, regardless of the payment method, are first cumulated, (€166,000), to apply the pricing by tier contributions offline check and transfer. Then, 2.50% excl. VAT of commission is added only for the funds collected by credit cards, which constitutes the differential between the credit card pricing and the check/transfer pricing, regardless of the tier:

€100,000 \* 4.17% + €66,000 \* 3.33% + €112,000 \*2.50% = €9,167.80 of commission excl. VAT.

For Creators collecting funds in a currency other than the euro, the commission is 6.67% excl. VAT for funds collected by Credit Cards, and 4.17% excl. VAT for funds collected via offline contributions.

VAT is applicable at the rate in force on the day the transfer of collected funds is carried out and depends on the Creator's location. The services provided by Ulule SAS are considered at the community level as being electronic services, the VAT rate applicable when the Creator is an individual depends on his location.

Since January 1, 2015, services provided electronically are taxable at the place of consumption when these services are provided by taxpayers, whether established or not in the European Union (EU), to non-taxable persons ("consumers") having their domicile or usual residence in the territory of the EU. Electronic services are thus taxable at the VAT rate in force in the Member State where the consumer is domiciled (for example 20% for a Creator individual based in France, which leads to a commission rate of 8% incl. VAT for funds collected by credit card below €100,000).

This transfer can be made as soon as the Creator has indicated all the necessary information for the transfer of sums (bank details in particular) and provided all the necessary identification data for the transfer of funds (RIB, copy of ID, etc.). The payment deadlines are as follows:

* within a maximum period of 12 business days following the expiration of the Collection Period for Fundraisers with Reward;
    
* within a maximum period of 12 business days following the request for fund transfer for Donation Fundraisers or Subscription Fundraisers.
    

4.5 Taxes Applicable on Collected Funds and Issuance of Tax Receipts
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is up to each User to pay any applicable tax or tax associated, whether on the Contributions collected by the mediation of the Site as Creators, or on the Contributions made by Users as support.

The Company can in no way substitute for them in this respect nor even advise them on the nature and detail of their obligations.

Creators are responsible for establishing and directly transmitting to Users the possible tax receipts attesting to donations made through the Site's mediation.

It is up to each User to verify his eligibility to benefit from tax deductions on all or part of the Contributions made through the Site's mediation, in accordance with the provisions of French law in force.

Any claim related to the production of said tax receipts and the information contained therein must be addressed directly by the User to the Creators.

4.6 Information on Users Transmitted to Creators
------------------------------------------------

In particular, to allow Creators to communicate with individuals interested in their Fundraiser, to animate their fundraising, and to send the promised Rewards and/or tax receipts, the Company communicates to Creators information about the identity of Users who have subscribed to their page, registered via the "coming-soon" feature to be kept informed of the launch of a Fundraiser, or contributed to a Fundraiser, as well as their postal addresses when provided by the User, in accordance with Ulule's Privacy Policy.

For more information on the data communicated by the Company to Creators, you are invited to consult Ulule's Privacy Policy.

To use the Services, the User must have the necessary equipment, software, and settings for the proper functioning of the Site. The User must have the skills, hardware, and software required for the use of the Internet. The User declares that he perfectly knows the characteristics and constraints of the Internet.

Given the specificities of the Internet network, the Company does not offer any guarantee of continuity of service, being held to this effect only by an obligation of means.

The Company's responsibility cannot be engaged in case of damages related to the temporary impossibility to access one of the services offered by the Site.

Any delay, suspension or cancellation in the dissemination of the Fundraiser due to technical failures inherent to the operation of the Internet, external to the Company and independent of its will, cannot give rise to any compensation of any kind and under any form.

The Company cannot be held responsible for a non-functioning, impossibility of access, or bad conditions of use of the Site attributable to unsuitable equipment, internal dysfunctions to the access provider of the User, in case of misuse of the Site or services by the User or due to the congestion of the Internet network in particular.

Once this data is communicated, the Company cannot be held responsible for the consequences of this disclosure.

The information provided by a User or Creator must be sincere, accurate and conform to reality. The consequences of their disclosure on their life and/or that of third parties are the exclusive responsibility of the User or Creator concerned.

It is reminded that the User takes the initiative to disclose and disseminate on the Site information, data, texts, content, photos, videos concerning himself. Thus, the User assumes full responsibility and renounces any recourse against the Company, in particular on the basis of the infringement of his right to image, his honor, his reputation, the intimacy of his private life, resulting from the dissemination or disclosure of information concerning himself, subject to legal provisions of public order.

The Company does not guarantee that the information presented is detailed, complete, verified or accurate. Documents, information, descriptive sheets, and, in general, any content present on the site are provided "as is", without any express or tacit guarantee of any kind.

It is expressly established that the Service Provider maintains the possibility of requesting before opening an account and at any time during the term of the Framework Contract, additional documents related to the Account Holder, the beneficial owners, or a specific Payment Operation.

The Account Holder grants the Platform the power to carry out the Payment Operation on their Payment Account under their full responsibility (“Proxy Power”). Proxy Power automatically ends upon the death of the Account Holder. It may be revoked at any time upon the Account Holder’s request by informing the representative and the Service Provider by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. Revoking it takes effect on the date the Service Provider receives the letter. The Account Holder remains responsible for Payment Operations initiated on its behalf until this date by the designated representative.   The Account Holder expressly releases the Service Provider from professional secrecy regarding the data of the Payment Account in terms of the representative designated under Proxy Power.

4.2.2.  Restriction of the Payment Account

By the Service Provider’s free assessment, use of a Payment Account may be restricted without the Service Provider having to justify their decision to the Account Holder in question. The functioning of the Payment Account will specifically be restricted when the Account Holder has not provided all of the information and documents required by the Service Provider, such as listed hereinabove. These restrictions are indicated to the Account Holder of the Platform.

4.2.3. Finalisation of Registration

After entering into the Framework Contract, the Account Holder must provide all of the information and proof that are requested by the Platform. By giving their consent to the terms of the Framework Contract, the Account Holder accepts that the Platform will transfer to the Service Provider their request for registration as an Account Holder and all the proof documents received by it.

The Service Provider alone has the power to accept the registration of an interested party as an Account Holder for a Payment Account in their name. This acceptance will be indicated to the Account Holder by the Platform by any means under the terms established on the Site.

The Service Provider, without motivation, or right to an indemnity in favour of the Account Holder, may refuse a request to open an Account. This refusal will be indicated to the Account Holder by the Platform by any means under the terms established on the Site.

5. Functioning of the Payment Account

The amounts credited to the Payment Account result from the funds transferred by Card (or by any other Payment Method accepted by the Service Provider), or the receipt of a transfer. The amounts debited from the Payment Account result: from executing a Payment Order to an account opened in the books of a Third-Party Payment Service Provider, of the Service Provider withdrawing fees due by the Account Holder under the Framework Contract or, a reversal of an operation by Card (or by any other Payment Method).

### 5.1. Acceptance of Payment Orders by Card for the Payment Account

Transactions for the Payment Account may be carried out by Card (or any other method accepted by the Service Provider), once or on several occasions. When such an operation is requested, the User will be identified on the Site by indicating their username (valid email address) and their password or via their Facebook account. The funds transfer request will be indicated on the Payment Page dedicated for this purpose. For all payments, the User may be requested to use a one-time code sent to their mobile telephone to the institution that issued the Card. If this is the case, it is the Service Provider’s right to refuse any payment following their free assessment without this decision giving rise to any indemnification. The funds transfer operation is carried out by the institution that issued the Card. Any dispute for such a transfer must be indicated to this institution. The Service Provider is not authorised to cancel such a transfer.

The Account Holder is informed that the Service Provider accepting a Payment Order by Card does not guarantee the receipt of these funds by the Account Holder in their Account. The funds arriving in the Payment Account of the Account Holder is based on the effective receipt by the Service Provider of the funds collected less the fees agreed to under the Price Conditions.

If the funds are not received for technical reasons, the Service Provider will make their best efforts to settle the operation. If the funds are not received for any other reason, the Service Provider will immediately inform the Account Holder of their inability to credit their Account in the expected amount, and to contact the User.

In the event that the transfer of funds to the Account of the Account Holder is cancelled by the institution issuing the Card following the User disputing it, the Account Holder accepts that the Service Provider may reverse any funds transfer operation by Card by debiting the Payment Account of the corresponding amount. The Account Holder recognises that such dispute may be brought to the attention of the institution issuing the Card up until a maximum time frame of thirteen (13) months following the date that the account was debited related to said Card. In the absence of sufficient provisions in the Account to carry out such a reversal, the Service Provider may suspend or cancel any Payment Operation initiated by the Account Holder or a representative, or as the case may be, subrogate the rights of the Account Holder by carrying out recovery procedures for the amount due by the User by any means.

### 5.2. Receipt of Transfer to the Payment Account

The Account Holder authorises the Service Provider to receive in their Payment Account SEPA transfer operations in euros from a bank account or payment account open in the books of a Third-Party PSP.

The funds are credited to the Payment Account by the Service Provider as quickly as possible following their effective receipt by the Service Provider. 

After the funds are credited to the Account Holder’s Payment Account, the Service Provider will make available a summary of the transfer operation received, including the following information: the reference number of the payment operation, a reference number allowing identification of the payer, the amount of the operation, the date of the credit value.

### 5.3. Execution of a Wire Transfer Operation Debited from the Payment Account

The Account Holder may transfer orders for SEPA or international wire transfers to a Beneficiary’s account held by a Third-Party PSP.

When the Account Holder wishes to carry out a Transfer Operation, they will indicate their identification in their Personal Online Area by indicating their Identification Data and, if need be, by following a Strong Authentication procedure if indicated to them. They will indicate on the Payment Page: the amount of the Payment Operation, the currency, the Payment Account to be debited, the date the Order is to be placed and any other required information. In the absence of a date indicated, the Transfer Order will be deemed to be placed immediately. The Account Holder must also follow the Authentication Procedure (or follow the Strong Authentication Procedure) indicated by the Service Provider.

The Account Holder may at any time issue a request to execute a Transfer Order to a Beneficiary designated by them that has a bank account or payment account from a Third-Party Payment Service Provider. The Account Holder must include the subject associated with each transfer by respecting the Authentication Procedure (or Strong Authentication Procedure, if it be the case) indicated by the Service Provider

The Account Holder irrevocably consents to the Payment Order by clicking on the “validation” button (“Date of Receipt”). The receipt of the Payment Order is confirmed in the Account Holder’s Personal Online Area. No Order may be withdrawn by the Account Holder after the date upon which it is deemed to irrevocably have been received, which is from the Date of Receipt.

Before issuing a Transfer Order, the Account Holder (or the Platform acting on their behalf) must ensure that they have a sufficient amount of credit available in their Account to cover the amount of the Payment Operation and the related fees as established in the Price Conditions. If necessary, they must credit their Account before the Order is validly transferred to the Service Provider to carry it out.

It is expressly agreed that the Payment Orders are executed at the latest at the end of the Business Day following the Date of Receipt of the Order by the Service Provider (and on the agreed-to execution date for standing or timely transfers). Any Payment Order received after 4:00 p.m. by the Service Provider will be deemed to have been received the following Business Day. If the Date of Receipt is not a Business Day, the Payment Order will be deemed to have been received the following Business Day.

For each Transfer Operation, the Account Holder may request from the Service Provider to be provided with a Hard Copy of the information related to the maximum execution time frame of this specific operation, the fees that they owe and, if it be the case, the details regarding these fees.

The Service Provider may be required to refuse to execute a Transfer Order that is incomplete or erroneous. The Account Holder must reissue the Order so that it is in proper conformity. Furthermore, the Service Provider may block a Transfer Order in the event of serious doubt regarding fraudulent use of the Account, unauthorised use of the Account, breach of security of the Account, in the event of a freeze issued by an administrative authority or for any other reason.

In the event a Transfer Order is refused or blocked, the Service Provider will inform the Account Holder thereof by any means. If possible, the Service Provider will indicate to the Account Holder the reasons for this refusal or blockage, unless it is prohibited from doing so due to a pertinent provision of national law or European Union law.

5.4. Reimbursement

The Account Holder may at any time transfer instructions to cancel a transfer of funds in order to reimburse a User. The Account Holder will access the Site indicating their identifier and password. They will indicate, in their Personal Online Area, the amount of the reimbursement, the currency, the User to be reimbursed and any other required information.

The reimbursement operation is carried out by the Service Provider by crediting the Card used by the User or by transfer using the original payment methods, within the limit of the available balance in the Account and the rules for each network and SEPA rules within five (5) Business Days following the Service Provider’s receipt of the request for reimbursement.

### 5.5. Specific Provisions for Services Initiating Payment and Information on Accounts Provided by Third-Party PSP

When a Wire Transfer Order is consented to by a Third-Party PSP offering the services of initiating payment, this consent is agreed to between the Account Holder and said Third-Party PSP under the conditions agreed to between them. The Service Provider is not involved under these conditions and may in no way be held responsible in the event of a dispute related to providing this service by the Third-Party PSP following said conditions.

The Account Holder may not revoke a payment order after giving their consent that the Third-Party PSP providing the service of initiating payment initiates the Payment Operation.

If an unauthorised, unexecuted or improperly executed Payment Operation is initiated by the Third-Party PSP providing the service of initiating payment, the Service Provider, at the latest at the end of the following Business Day, shall immediately reimburse the Account Holder in the amount of the unauthorised, unexecuted or improperly executed operation and, if it be the case, refund the Account debited so that it is in the state that it would be in if the unauthorised or improperly executed Payment Operation had not taken place. The date on which the Account Holder’s Payment Account is credited shall not be dated later than the date upon which it was debited.

6. Reporting
------------

The Account Holder, in their Personal Online Area, has a statement of the Payment Operations carried out on the Payment Account available to them. They are asked to attentively acknowledge the list of these operations. Operations statements may also, upon express request, be made available to the professional Account Holder for other time frames.

It is specified that for each Transfer Operation carried out by the Service Provider, the Account Holder has the following information available to them: the reference number of the Operation, the identification of the Beneficiary, the amount of the Operation, the date the Order is received, and if it be the case, the fees related to executing this Operation.

7. Access to the Payment Account and Confidentiality of Personalised Security Data

The Payment Account is accessible online in the Personal Online Area, by using the Identification Data and in compliance with the requested Authentication Procedure (or Strong Authentication Procedure, depending on the case).

The Account Holder must indicate the Identification Data of each Authorised Person. Each Authorised Person accepts to not use the name or Identification Data of another person. The Account Holder alone is responsible for the use of their identifier.

Each Authorised Person is fully responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their Identification Data, as well as any other Personalised Security Data potentially provided to the Service Provider or the Platform. The Account Holder must take all reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality and security of their Personalised Security Data. They also undertake to educate the Authorised Persons regarding the confidentiality and security of their own Personalised Security Data. 

The Account Holder (and each Authorised Person) accepts to not communicate their Personalised Security Data to third parties. By way of exception, the Account Holder may communicate to authorised Third-Party PSP in a Member State of the European Union or in a State that is part of the European Economic Area agreement for information services regarding the accounts and initiation of Payment Operation (such as defined in Article 4 of European Directive 2015/2366, called “PSD2”). The Account Holder must ensure that this Third-Party PSP is authorised for the above-mentioned services and that it accesses the Personalised Security Data in a secured environment.

8. Objection Regarding Personalised Security Data
-------------------------------------------------

The Account Holder must inform the Platform of the loss or theft of their Personalised Security Data, of any misuse or unauthorised use of their Personal Online Area or data relating to them as soon as they become aware of this and request that it be blocked. This declaration must be carried out:

\-  by making a telephone call to the Platform Customer Service at the number indicated in the General Conditions of the Site; or

\-  directly by electronic message through the contact form accessible on the Site.

The Service Provider, through the Platform, shall immediately execute the request for objection. The event will be recorded and date/time stamped. An objection number with date/time stamp will be provided to the Account Holder. Written confirmation of this objection will be sent by the Platform to the Account Holder in question by electronic message.

9. Blocking a Payment Account and Refusing Access to a Payment Account

The Service Provider reserves the right to block the Payment Account for objectively motivated reasons regarding the security of the Payment Account, the presumption of unauthorised or fraudulent use the Payment Account or a significantly increased risk that the Account Holder is incapable of fulfilling their obligation to pay the fees due under this Framework Contract.

The Account Holder is informed that the Service Provider may refuse access to the Payment Account by Third-Party PSP providing the service of initiating payment or information on the accounts, for objectively motivated or documented reasons related to unauthorised or fraudulent access to the Payment Account by this Service Provider, including initiating an unauthorised or fraudulent payment operation.

In this event, the Account Holder will be informed in their Personal Online Area of the block or refusal of access to the Payment Account and the reasons for this block or refusal. This information will be provided to them, if possible, before the Payment Account is blocked or access is refused and at the latest immediately after the block or refusal, unless providing this information is not communicable for reasons of objectively motivated security or is prohibited under another provision of pertinent European Union or national law.

The Service Provider will unblock the Account or re-establish access to it when the reasons for the block or refusal of access no longer exist. The Account Holder may request at any time that the Account be unblocked by indicating this to the Platform Customer Service, the contact information of which is included in the General Conditions of the Site. The Account Holder may be requested to create new Identification Data.

If an Order is executed by the Service Provider with errors attributed to this latter, this should be contested as soon as possible to the Service Provider, the Order will then be cancelled and the Account returned to the situation that it was in before receiving the Payment Order.

The Service Provider will return the Account to the state it was in before the unauthorised Payment Operation took place

11. Financial Conditions
------------------------

The services offered herein are invoiced by the Platform on behalf of the Service Provider in compliance with the Price Conditions.

Any commissions due by the Account Holder are automatically deducted from the Payment Account by the Service Provider. The Account Holder authorises the Service Provider to compensate at any time, even after the Account is closed, any irrefutable credit, liquid and collectible that remains owed, of any nature whatsoever. Funds in the Payment Account may be compensated for any amount due, collectible and unpaid of the Account Holder to the Service Provider.

In the event of late payment of the amounts due and collectible of the Account Holder to the Service Provider, the Account Holder will owe late-payment interests for the period from the date they are due until payment is complete. The applicable interest rate will be calculated on the basis of two times the annual legal interest rate published twice yearly for businesses. The amount of late-payment interest will be equal to the product of the amount unpaid multiplied by the above-mentioned legal interest rate and the number of days late over 365.

12. Term and Termination   
---------------------------

The Framework Contract is entered into for an indeterminate period. It enters into force from the time it is accepted by the Account Holder.

The latter may at any time and by respecting an advance notice of thirty (30) calendar days, terminate the Framework Contract. The Service Provider may at any time terminate the Framework Contract, by respecting an advance notice of two (2) months provided in Hard Copy format. In this case, the fees irrefutably owed for the Payment Services are due by the Account Holder on a pro rata basis for the period elapsed at the termination date.

If the credit in the Payment Account surpasses the threshold indicated in the Price Conditions, the amount surpassing the threshold will be transferred within thirty (30) days following the date the termination takes effect to the Account Holder’s bank account after deducting the fees due and payable to the Service Provider. The Service Provided is discharged of any obligation upon confirming to the Account Holder the transfer to the bank account indicated.

In the event of serious breach, fraud, or lack of payment on the part of the Account Holder, the Service Provider reserves the right to suspend or terminate this Contract by sending an email along with a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt without providing reasons or advance notice.

Lacking notification of refusal before the indicated date that they enter into force, the Account Holder will be deemed to have accepted the proposed modifications. The relationship between the Parties after the date of entry into force will then be governed by the new version of the Framework Contract.

In the event the Account Holder refuses, this refusal will give rise, without fees, to the termination of the Framework Contract, as well as the transfer of the balance of the Payment Account in a time frame of thirteen (13) months following the date the termination takes effect in order to cover anything contested in the future.

Any legislative or regulatory provisions that make modifications necessary to any part of the Framework Contract will be applicable from the date they enter into force, without advance notice. However, the Account Holder will be informed thereof.

14. Security
------------

The Service Provider undertakes to ensure that the services are provided with respect to the applicable laws and regulations and best practices. Specifically, the Service Provider shall do what is necessary to ensure the security and confidentiality of the Account Holder’s data, in compliance with the regulation in force.

The Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily suspend access to the online Account for technical, security or maintenance reasons without these operations invoking any right to an indemnity of any kind. It undertakes to limit these types of interruptions to those that are strictly necessary.

However, the Service Provider shall not be held responsible to the Account Holder for potential errors, omissions, interruptions or delays of operations carried out via the Site that result from unauthorised access by the latter. The Service Provider shall not be held responsible for the theft, destruction or unauthorised disclosure of data that results from unauthorised access to the Site. Furthermore, the Service Provider remains outside of the scope of the legal relationship between the Account Holder and a User or between the Account Holder and the Site. The Service Provider will not be held responsible for defaults, breaches or negligence between a User and an Account Holder, or the Site and an Account Holder.  

If the unique identifier or any other information necessary to carry out a Payment Operation provided by the Account Holder is inexact, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible for the improper execution of said Service.

The Platform alone is responsible for the security and confidentiality of the data exchanged in the framework of using the Site in compliance with the General Conditions of the Site, the Service Provider being responsible for the security and confidentiality of the data that it exchanges with the Account Holder in the framework hereof for creating and managing their Account, as well as Payment Operations related to the Account.

15. Limits to the Service Provider’s Liability
----------------------------------------------

The Service Provider is in no way involved in the legal and commercial relationships and potential disputes arising between the Account Holder and the User or between the Account Holder and the Platform or between the Account Holder and a Beneficiary. The Service Provider exercises no oversight over the conformity, security, legality, characteristics and the appropriate character of the products and services subject to a Payment Operation.

Every operation carried out by the Account Holder gives rise to a contract created directly between themselves and a User who is a stranger to the Service Provider. Consequently, the latter cannot be held responsible for the non-performance or improper performance of the obligations arising from it, or any potential damages caused to the Account Holder.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Contract, the Service Provider’s liability in terms of an Account Holder is limited to reparations for direct damages as established by regulation.

16. The Account Holder’s Commitments
------------------------------------

The Account Holder acknowledges that elements in their Personal Online Area do not infringe on the rights of a third party and are not contrary to the law, public order, or proper ethics.

They undertake:

(i)  To not perform the Framework Contract in an illegal manner or under conditions that may damage, deactivate, overload or alter the site;

(ii) To not usurp the identity of another person or entity, falsify or divulge their identity, their age or create a false identity;

(iii) To not divulge data or personal information related to a third party, such as postal addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, bank card numbers, etc. In the event of a breach of these obligations, the Service Provider may take all appropriate measures in order to bring an end to these actions. It also has the right to suspend, erase and/or block the Account Holder’s access to their Account.

(iv) Without prejudice to legal actions undertaken by third parties, the Service Provider has the right to personally bring any legal action that seeks to repair the damages that it has personally been subject to due to the Account Holder’s breach of their obligations under this Contract.

The Framework Contract may only be put into effect before the withdrawal deadline has expired upon the approval of the consumer Account Holder. The consumer Account Holder recognises that the use of Payment Services after entering into the Framework Contract constitutes an express request on its part to begin performing the Framework Contract before the above-mentioned deadline has expired. Exercising the right of withdrawal involves the Framework Contract coming to an end, and in the event performance thereof has begun, takes the form of termination and does not bring into question the services previously provided.

### 17.3. Exercising the Withdrawal Right

The Account Holder must notify the Platform Customer Service of their withdrawal request within the indicated time frame by telephone or by email and by sending confirmation to the address of the Platform Customer Service.
