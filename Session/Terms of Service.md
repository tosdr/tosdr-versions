Session Legal

Session Terms of Service
========================

Last Updated: 15/04/2024

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our services that are fully owned and operated by the Oxen Privacy Tech Foundation (referred to as “we”, “our”, “OPTF”) including the Session website and the Session Private Messenger applications, including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android and Mac iOS (collectively, referred to as the “Services”) and any information, text, links, graphics, videos, audio or other material uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively, referred to as “Content”).

These Terms and the Session Privacy Policy form the End User Agreement between you and the OPTF Ltd.

The Services are fully owned and delivered by the OPTF Ltd, a not-for-profit charity registered in Australia.

1\. Who can use the Services
----------------------------

Anyone who is not barred from using the Services under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, and is at least 18 years of age can use the Service. 

By using these Services, you agree to form a binding End User Agreement between you and the OPTF Ltd. 

If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, in which case the words “you” and “your” as used in these Terms shall refer to such entity.

2\. Our Privacy Policy
----------------------

Privacy is central to our purpose and mission. For more details, please refer to the [Session Privacy Policy](https://getsession.org/privacy-policy).

3\. Our Services
----------------

Our Services are intended to inform you and educate you about using our private and secure communications app, and facilitate private and secure communications between two or more parties, within a group, or within a community (Session Website, or Session App).

Availability of Our Services: Our Services may be interrupted, including for maintenance, upgrades, or network or equipment failures. We may discontinue some or all of our Services, including certain features and the support for certain devices and platforms, at any time.

### 3.1. Using the Session Website

The purpose of the Session Website is primarily to provide you with information about the Session App and link to download of the Session App. We have done our best to make sure this information is accurate and up-to-date, however, there may be unintentional errors that may mislead you. Therefore, we encourage you to contact us for any clarifications you may need.

The Session Website also enables you to submit your contact details, so we are able to keep you informed about our work.

### 3.2. Using the Session App

The purpose of the Session App is to facilitate private and secure communications, without capturing or sharing any meta-data. It was intentionally created for use by individuals who require anonymity and security.

**What do we mean by ‘private’?** The Session App does not require you to identify yourself or associate your personally identifiable information to use the service. The Session App does not attempt to gather information or individually identify users through their use of the service. 

**What do we mean by ‘secure’?** The messages you create on your Session App are encrypted and only the destination Session ID can decrypt the message. The encrypted messages are wrapped in multiple layers of onion encryption and routed from the Session App through our distributed onion network before reaching their destination. 

While we make every effort to ensure security, we cannot guarantee interception or decryption using advanced technologies are impossible.

The Session App is a messaging app, and does not have the ability to communicate with non-Session Apps or services. Our Services do not provide access to public emergency service providers like the police, fire department, hospitals, or other public safety organizations.

4\. Our Responsibilities and Commitments to You
-----------------------------------------------

We are committed to ensuring the delivery of our Services in a way that is accessible and reliable.

We will not sell or otherwise monetise your personal data or content in any way. We cannot access your data even if we wanted to, as Session preserves the privacy and secrecy of your messages. See our Privacy Policy for more information.

Session’s License to You — Session grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use our Services in accordance with these Terms.

Availability of Our Services — We strive to ensure that our Services are continuously available for use.

Keeping you informed — We continuously provide updates about our Services through various channels, including the Session Blog, Session Twitter Account and a number of communities on Session and on Telegram.

To report copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property infringement, please contact [\[email protected\]](https://getsession.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

### 5.2. Session Content Policy

OPTF exists to build private and secure technology, and defend your right to privacy and security in the digital world. We are also mission-driven to uphold key democratic, media freedom and human rights principles.

To enable us to uphold our mission principles, we have identified the following activities of Session as a clear breach of these Terms.

**Violent Behaviour, Violent Extremism and Terrorism**

Session cannot be used to:

* to glorify violence, or promote violence of any form (physical, psychological, sexual) against another individual or group, or incite harm or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.
    
* by organisations, groups and individuals designated by the United Nations as terrorist organisations or terrorists.
    

**Child Sexual Exploitation**

Session cannot be used to organise or promote child sexual exploitation. A child is defined as anyone under the age of 18. Specifically, Session cannot be used to store or share:

* visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts;
    
* illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually explicit context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts;
    
* sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor;
    
* links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material;
    
* fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation;
    
* recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harbouring and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes.
    

**Extremely Violence and/or Graphic Content**

Session cannot be used to store or share violent or gory content that is intended to shock or disgust others, or create harm or distress to the person or persons represented in the content.

**Harmful and/or Unlawful Content**

Session cannot be used for cyber abuse, non-consensual sharing of intimate images and abhorrent violent material.

6.0 Monitoring Session Breaches
-------------------------------

Our Services have been created using a privacy-by-design approach which means that it is impossible for us to analyse or monitor your content you create and store on the Session App, or share it with other users.

Communities on Session, by their nature, are open to the public, and the content posted and shared through Communities can be monitored. OPTF does not have the capacity to monitor all Communities, however, we do make a concerted effort to monitor and where necessary moderate Communities that have been created by us.

### 6.1 Third-party notification of breaches

We may be notified by third-parties of breaches to these Terms. In such cases, the evidence presented by the third-parties will be accessed by our Board and Members, to determine the severity of the breach and the required outcomes. We may engage external experts to further assist and inform us. The decisions made by our Board and Members will be final.

All notifications, including requests for information or take down notices, will be documented in our Transparency Report that is updated every three months.

7.0 Disclaimers and Limitations
-------------------------------

Disclaimers — YOU USE OUR SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING DISCLAIMERS. WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE. Session DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR USEFUL, THAT OUR SERVICES WILL BE OPERATIONAL, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR SAFE, OR THAT OUR SERVICES WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OR IMPERFECTIONS. WE DO NOT CONTROL, AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, CONTROLLING HOW OR WHEN OUR USERS USE OUR SERVICES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING CONTENT) OF OUR USERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. YOU RELEASE US, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AND AGENTS (TOGETHER, “SESSION PARTIES”) FROM ANY CLAIM, COMPLAINT, CAUSE OF ACTION, CONTROVERSY, OR DISPUTE (TOGETHER, “CLAIM”) AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY SUCH CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTIES.

Limitation of Liability — THE SESSION PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE SESSION PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10). THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LAWS OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Ending these Terms — You may end these Terms with Session at any time by deleting Session from your device and discontinuing use of our Services. We may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of our Services anytime for any reason, such as if you violate the letter or spirit of our Terms or create harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for Session. The following provisions will survive termination of your relationship with Session: “Licenses,” “Disclaimers and Limitations,” “Your Responsibilities,” “Our Services” “Availability” and “Ending these Terms,” and “General”.

9.0 General
-----------

Session may update the Terms at any time. When we update our Terms, We will update the “Last Modified” date associated with the updated Terms. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our updated Terms and supersedes any prior agreed Terms. You will comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws. Our Terms cover the entire agreement between you and Session regarding our Services. If you do not agree with our Terms, you should stop using our Services.

If we fail to enforce our Terms, we do not waive the right to enforce them. If any provision of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from our Terms and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our Services are not intended for distribution to or use in any country where such distribution or use would violate local law or would subject us to any regulations in another country.
