Cookie Information
------------------

**General cookies:**

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Expires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \_\_cflb | Cloudflare: For load-balancing purposes, a \__cflb_ cookie is set with a unique value on the first response to the requesting client | Up to 1 day |
| cookiebanner\_accepted, cookiebanner\_accepted-legacy, cookieconsent\_status | Cookie used to prevent us from alerting the user to our cookie policy after the user has dismissed the message the first time | Infinite / the year 9999 |
| \_ga, \_gac\_UA-XXXXXXX-X, \_gat\_UA-XXXXXXX-X, \_gid | Google Analytics: allows us to analyse user experience on the website | Between 1 minute and 1 day |
| pardot, lpvXXXX, visitor\_idXXXX, visitor\_idXXXX-XXXX | Pardot: Cookies set for user engagement and tracking | Between session length and 10 years |
| pi\_opt\_in | Pardot: For opting in / out of Pardot tracking | 10 years |
| profile, profile.sig | Cookies set by Raspberry Pi Accounts in order to identify user sessions | 1 week |
| \_voucher\_app\_session, \_showcase\_session, \_pi\_redeemer\_session | Cookies set by Raspberry Pi applications in order to identify user sessions | 1 week |
| \_\_stripe\_mid | Stripe: Used to make credit card payments (eg. donations). Stripe uses a cookie to remember who you are and to enable the Raspberry Pi Foundation to process payments without storing any credit card information on our own servers | 1 minute |
| \_\_stripe\_sid | Stripe: Used to make credit card payments (eg. donations). Stripe uses a cookie to remember who you are and to enable us to process payments without storing any credit card information on our own servers | 30 minutes |
| wordpress\_XXXX,  <br>wordpress\_logged\_in\_XXXX,  <br>wordpress\_test\_cookie,  <br>wp-settings-XXXX-XXXX, comment\_author\_XXXX,  <br>comment\_author\_email\_XXXX,  <br>comment\_author\_url\_XXXX | WordPress: Used to identify user sessions and provide customisation, along with supporting the creation of comments (eg. on blog posts) | Between session length and 1 year |

**CoderDojo Sites:**

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Expires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seneca-login | Used to identify user sessions | 2 days |
| cookieDisclaimer | Whether the user has seen the site-wide notice regarding the use of cookies | 1 year |
| canViewYouthForums | Whether the user can see the O13 forums | On session expiry |
| verifyProfileComplete | Whether the user has completed required fields of their profile | On session expiry |
| NG\_TRANSLATE\_LANG\_KEY | The locale of the users browser, to display the relevant language to them | On session expiry |

**Code Club Sites:**

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Expires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| intercom-id-XXXX | Intercom: Anonymous visitor identification | 1 year |
| intercom-session-XXXX | Intercom: Used to identify user sessions, in order to use the support chat functionality | 1 week |
| \_union\_session | Used to identify user sessions | On session expiry |

**Forums:**

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Expires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| phpbb3\_XXXX\_k, phpbb3\_XXXX\_sid, phpbb3\_XXXX\_u | Used to identify user sessions | 1 month |

**Where Hotjar is in use:**

| Cookie Name | Purpose | Expires |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \_hjClosedSurveyInvites | Hotjar cookie that is set once a user interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal. It is used to  <br>ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown. | 365 days |
| \_hjDonePolls | Hotjar cookie that is set once a user completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget. It is used to  <br>ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in. | 365 days |
| \_hjMinimizedPolls | Hotjar cookie that is set once a user minimizes an On-site Survey widget. It is used to ensure that the  <br>widget stays minimized when the user navigates through your site. | 365 days |
| \_hjShownFeedbackMessage | Hotjar cookie that is set when a user minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback. This is done so that the  <br>Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the user navigates to another page where it is set to  <br>show. | 365 days |
| \_hjSessionTooLarge | Causes Hotjar to stop collecting data if a session becomes too large. This is determined automatically by a  <br>signal from the WebSocket server if the session size exceeds the limit. | Session |
| \_hjid | Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It is used to  <br>persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent  <br>visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID. | 365 days |
| \_hjRecordingLastActivity | This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated when a user recording  <br>starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the user performs an action that Hotjar records). | Session |
| \_hjTLDTest | When the Hotjar script executes it tries to determine the most generic cookie path to use, instead of  <br>the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To  <br>determine this, it stores the \_hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.  <br>After this check, the cookie is removed. | Session |
| \_hjUserAttributesHash | User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to  <br>know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated. | Session |
| \_hjCachedUserAttributes | This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not  <br>in the sample. These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool. | Session |
| \_hjLocalStorageTest | This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage. If it can, a value of 1 is  <br>set in this cookie. The data stored in\_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost  <br>immediately after it is created. | Under 100ms |
| \_hjIncludedInPageviewSample | This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your  <br>site’s pageview limit. | 30 minutes |
| \_hjIncludedInSessionSample | This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your  <br>site’s daily session limit. | 30 minutes |
| \_hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress | This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user. This is a True/False flag set by the  <br>cookie. | 30 Minutes |
| \_hjFirstSeen | This is set to identify a new user’s first session. It stores a true/false value, indicating whether this was  <br>the first time Hotjar saw this user. It is used by Recording filters to identify new user sessions. | Session |
| \_hjViewportId | This stores information about the user viewport such as size and dimensions. | Session |
| \_hjRecordingEnabled | This is added when a Recording starts and is read when the recording module is initialized to see if the user  <br>is already in a recording in a particular session. | Session |
