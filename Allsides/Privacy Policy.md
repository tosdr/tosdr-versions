----------------------

We collect information about you from a variety of sources, including:

* Directly from you when you provide it to us.
* Automatically as you utilize the Services. 
* From third parties, including analytics providers.
* In some cases, if you are a student, from your teachers or school; if you are an educator, from your school.

### Information directly from you.

When you sign up for an AllSides membership account, we may ask for your name, email address, account username and password. If you are an educator signing up for a School membership, we may ask you for your school’s name and other general employment information. When you sign up for an AllSides mailing list, we collect your email address. In addition, we gather information through voluntary questionnaires, event registration forms, surveys, and feedback programs. Additionally, you may choose to provide us with information directly when you contact us to request customer support, request information, apply for a job, or participate in interactive features on our Services.

If you are an educator using our Mismatch platform, you may choose to provide us with the following information, including:

* For creating an account: We require your name, your role at the school you teach at, what subject you teach or what department you lead, and your school’s name, address, grade level, and time zone.
* For building a classroom profile: We ask you to provide your name, the grade you teach, the number of students in your classroom, the general political profile of the classroom (e.g., conservative, progressive/liberal, or a mix of the two), the socioeconomic profile of the classroom based on what percentage of students receive free or reduced lunches at school, the demographic profile of the classroom based on race and/or ethnicity, and the geographic profile of the classroom based on where students live (suburban, urban, or rural).
* To complete engagement surveys: We may provide surveys relating to Mismatch interactions in which students and classes are asked to review their interactions and experiences facilitated through the Mismatch platform.  

If you are a student at a school which uses our Mismatch service, we may collect information about you – either from you or from the school or your teachers – in order to support the use of Mismatch. You should contact your school to understand their practices for handling your information.

Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet
---------------------------------------------------

We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. In California we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years old. Some parts of our Services are intended for use by children under the age of 13. In particular, this applies to students accessing content via a school membership. For these students, our [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Notice](https://www.allsides.com/coppa-notice) applies. 

AllSides encourages minors to seek the consent of their parents before providing any information about themselves or their households to anyone on the Internet. AllSides encourages parents to take an active role to protect the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the inappropriate use of information about their children.

If you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us at [privacy@allsides.com](mailto:privacy@allsides.com). We will remove the data to the extent required by applicable laws.
