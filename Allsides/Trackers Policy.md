In some cases, we may use Cookies to collect information that is defined as personal data, or that can become personal data if we combine it with other information. In such cases, the [AllSides Privacy Notice](https://www.allsides.com/privacy) will apply in addition to this AllSides Cookie Policy.

What are Cookies?
-----------------

A cookie is a small piece of data (a text file, usually consisting of letters and numbers) that a website – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites operate more efficiently and provide analytical information.

We classify these cookies into the following categories:

* **Strictly Necessary Cookies.** These cookies provide the service, application, and other essential functionalities of our Services.
* **Performance Cookies.** These cookies provide quantitative measurement of our Services and its resources used for purposes like troubleshooting and analytics. For example, we may use these types of cookies to ensure that visitors can easily find the information they are looking for on our Services.
* **Functional Cookies.** These cookies provide enhanced performance for some website resources and services as well as sometimes to adopt a higher level of personalisation on user experience.
* **Targeting Cookies.** These cookies provide behavioral advertising and re-marketing of analytical data. One purpose of this is to help make the content displayed on our Services more relevant to you. Another purpose is to allow us and our service providers to deliver advertisements or other communications to you that are designed to be more relevant to your apparent interests.

How Long Cookies Stay on Devices
--------------------------------

Some of our Cookies operate from the time you visit an AllSides service to the end of that particular web-browsing session. These Cookies expire and are automatically deleted when you close your internet browser. These Cookies are called "session" Cookies.

Some Cookies will stay on your device between browsing sessions. They do not expire when you close your browser. These Cookies are called "persistent" Cookies. The length of time a persistent cookie stays on your device varies from cookie to cookie. We and others use persistent Cookies for a variety of purposes, such as to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time, and the effectiveness of advertising efforts.

Who Places Cookies on Devices
-----------------------------

Cookies may be placed on your device by AllSides as the Site operator. These Cookies are called "first party" Cookies. Some Cookies may be placed on your device by a party other than AllSides. These Cookies are called "third party" Cookies. For example, an AllSides partner may place a third-party cookie to enable advertisements.

Cookies may also be used that allow us and third parties to know when you visit our Services, and to understand how you interact with emails, advertisements, or other content. Through Cookies, aggregate and other information not considered to be personal data (such as your operating system, browser version, and the URL you came from, including from emails and advertisements) may be obtained and used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns. This technology counts the number of users who visit a particular service from specific banner advertisements outside the AllSides Site or who clicked on links or graphics included in email newsletters received from AllSides. It is also used as a tool to compile aggregated statistics about how AllSides Services are used, to perform and analytics and help us to optimize our Services, and to help serve you advertising based on your interests, as described in further detail below.

How AllSides Uses Advertisements
--------------------------------

We and third parties, including technology partners, and service providers engage in interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and personalized content that we and other advertisers believe will be of interest to you. To the extent third party vendors are using Cookies to perform these services for AllSides, AllSides does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

Ads may be delivered to you based on your online or mobile behavior (on AllSides Services and non-AllSides websites), your search activity, your responses to one of our advertisements or emails, the pages you visit, your general geographic location, or other information. These ads may appear on our Services or on third party websites.
