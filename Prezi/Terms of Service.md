Prezi Public (free) Accounts. If you have a Prezi Public (free) account, all of the User Content you create, including all of the information within your presentations, your videos, your other content, and your username will be available to anyone who has access to the internet (“Public User Content”). Public account holders with specific licenses may be able to create Private User Content, as defined below, including the option to create unlisted/private videos. Public User Content, including presentations or videos, can be viewed by other Prezi users, will appear in the searchable Prezi database, in publicly available search engines and will be available for others to access and view online. Accordingly, you hereby do and shall grant to each Prezi user and to the public, a worldwide, non-exclusive license to access, view, publicly perform, publicly display and communicate to the public your Public User Content. This license ends one year after you delete the Public User Content, including the presentation or video, or your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the Public User Content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it.  
  
Paid Prezi Accounts. If you are making use of the Service to display or edit User Content (including presentations, videos, and other content) that you do not wish to be accessible or viewable by other Prezi users or the public (“Private User Content”) – or if you wish to display or edit your User Content – you are required to have a paid Prezi account. If you have an educational or paid Prezi account, your user name may be shared by Prezi with others who we think might be interested in you, but you can choose to designate your content Public User Content or Private User Content. Presentations designated as Private User Content will not be available to the public. It is Your responsibility to designate your content as Private else the content will, by default, be Public.  Rather, they will be available to you, and to those Prezi users with whom you have chosen to share the User Content. You may invite one or more people (a “Viewer”) to view your presentation or video by sending them a “share” or “invite” link. You can learn more about sharing [here](https://support.prezi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003476514-Sharing-and-Setting-the-Privacy-State-of-Your-Prezi-Classic-Presentations). You hereby do and shall grant to each Invited Viewer a worldwide, non-exclusive license to access, view, publicly perform, publicly display and communicate to the public your Private User Content. This license ends one year after you delete the Private User Content, including the presentation or video, or your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the Private User Content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it.  
  
Sharing with edit rights. Regardless of whether your User Content has been designated as Public User Content or Private User Content, you may choose to share a presentation, video or other User Content in a manner that allows the person you’ve shared such User Content with (a “Co-editor”) to reuse or edit that User Content, or portions thereof as permitted by the Prezi Services. You can learn more about sharing with edit rights [here](https://support.prezi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003478554-Setting-privacy). You hereby do and shall grant to each Co-editor a worldwide, non-exclusive license to use, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate to the public, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and transmit the content of which they are Co-editors. This license ends one year after you delete the content or your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the User Content has been shared with the Co-editors and they have not deleted it.  
  
Allowing Re-use. If your content is designated as Public User Content, you may choose to “allow re-use” of that content (in the case of videos that are designated Public User Content, you are required to allow re-use). When you allow re-use of your Public User Content, you hereby do and shall grant to each user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive license to use, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate to the public, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and transmit your User Content, and portions thereof as permitted by the Prezi Services. This license ends when you delete the Public User Content, including presentation or video, or your account is closed (either by you or by us), except to the extent that the Public User Content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it. The “allow reuse” option is enabled by default for Prezi Public accounts when creating new presentations and videos; the option can be disabled for presentations, but not for videos.  
  
Prezi Videos. You may create, stream, record and share videos using the Prezi Services. These videos may feature, among other things, the image of you, Prezi presentations, and other User Content.

This license ends one year after you delete the presentation or your Prezi for Teams account is closed (either by you, the Team Administrator or by us), except to the extent that the content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it.  
  
Business Accounts. If you sign up for a Prezi Public Account or a Paid Prezi Account with an e-mail address using a domain owned by an organization (“Organization”) then, depending on your country of habitual residence and the agreement entered into between us and the Organization, your account (a “Business Account”) is subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement between Prezi and the Organization. Those terms may be in addition to or different from the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Please note that the Organization controls your Business Account and may have the same rights with regard to your Business Account that a Team Administrator has with regard to a Prezi for Teams account.  
  
If you convert your account to a Business Account, the Organization may prevent you from subsequently converting your account to another account type. Please ask your Organization about the specific conditions applicable to your Business Account. You hereby do and shall grant to the Organization a worldwide, non-exclusive license to use, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate to the public, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and transmit the Public User Content or Private User Content of your account.

With respect to Private User Content, you hereby do and shall grant to Prezi (and its successors, assignees, and third-party service providers) a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate to the public, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and transmit the content for the purpose of providing you, and those with whom you have shared your Private User Content, including but not limited to presentations, videos, with the Service.

With respect to Public User Content, you hereby do and shall grant to Prezi (and its successors, assignees, and third-party service providers) a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate to the public, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute and transmit the Public User Content (1) for the purpose of providing you, and those with whom you have shared Public User Content, including but not limited to your presentations, videos (including the public), with the Service; and (2) in connection with promotion and marketing of Prezi products and services, including without limitation allowing third parties to search or index the content, in connection with email promotions, product demonstrations, and the like.

Regardless of whether you designate content public or private, Prezi makes no claim of ownership to your User Content and obtains no rights to your content other than as provided for herein.**

### **8.3 Expiration and revocability of licenses**

**Prezi makes it easy for users with qualified accounts to change a presentation’s public/private, and “allow reuse” status at any time.  
  
However, uses made of your presentation, video or other User Content, whether by Prezi or its users, are subject to the licenses that were in place at the time such use was originally made by the person or entity who originally made the use. For example, licensed uses of Public User Content, or content that allows reuse, may continue to be made after such content is designated Private User Content, by those users who previously used the content under the prior license.**

### **8.4 Third-party and linked/embedded content**

**Prezi gives you the option, when creating or editing a presentation, to search for and insert third-party content, including but not limited to images and content from other web-based platforms (such as Infogram), into your User Content (presentations, videos, etc.). Such third-party content is subject to the license terms and contractual provisions that accompany it, and you are solely responsible for compliance with all such terms and provisions. For example, if you use an image that is licensed pursuant to a Creative Commons license that prohibits commercial use, you may not use the image for commercial purposes. Similarly, if you use Infogram charts, custom images, YouTube videos, or other third-party content in your User Content, including presentations, videos, your use must be consistent with the terms of use provided by those third parties, and the licenses applicable to that content. Some license terms and contractual provisions may limit the manner in which you are permitted to use your User Content, such as share it with others, or allow re-use of presentation, video.**

### **8.5 Professional Services**

**If your Prezi account includes design services, training services or other professional services, (collectively, “Professional Services”), this section applies to your account.  
  
Prezi will perform the Professional Services in a competent and professional manner.  
‍  
You will provide all assistance and cooperation to Prezi reasonably necessary to permit Prezi to perform the Professional Services. You acknowledge that failure to provide such assistance and cooperation may impair Prezi’s ability to provide the Professional Services and may result in additional charges being invoiced to you as a result of additional time or expenses incurred by Prezi as a result. You will be responsible for making, at your sole expense, any changes or additions to your hardware and software systems that may be required to support Prezi’s performance of the Professional Services or the installation, implementation and/or use of any deliverables specified (each, a “Deliverable” and, collectively, the “Deliverables”). You will assign a project manager to (i) assist and coordinate with Prezi in connection with its performance of the Professional Services, (ii) serve as a principal point of contact with Prezi and (iii) perform the review, analysis, and acceptance of the Deliverables.  
  
Upon payment in full of the fees for your Prezi account which includes Professional Services, or upon payment in full of Prezi’s fees for the Professional Services if such fees are separate from the charges for your Prezi account, you will have a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license to use the resulting Deliverables solely in connection with your Prezi account on a trial basis for sixty (60) days from the date your Prezi account is activated (the “Trial Period”). You may terminate the Trial Period prior to its scheduled end by issuing a written termination notice to Prezi. Upon Prezi’s receipt of the termination notice, the Trial Period will terminate, your license to use the Deliverables will terminate, you may not make any further use of the Deliverables and you will be entitled to a credit for the portion of the fees which you paid which are applicable to the Professional Services which directly relate to the applicable Deliverables. If you do not issue Prezi a written termination notice before the scheduled end of the Trial Period, you will have a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license to use the resulting Deliverables solely in connection with your Prezi account until your Prezi account expires or is terminated.  
  
Prezi reserves all rights to the Deliverables that are not expressly granted in these Terms of Service. Nothing in these Terms of Service will be construed as granting you any property rights in or to the Deliverables or in or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights that have been issued, or that may issue, based on the Deliverables. The Deliverables are licensed hereby, not sold.**

**9\. Payment Terms**
---------------------

### **9.1 Payment for subscription**

**You agree to pay the then-current fee for your account type. Some Prezi accounts are offered with a free trial period. Such free trials are limited to one-per-user. Users must not fraudulently obtain (or attempt to obtain) additional trial periods beyond the single free trial term.  
  
If your account began with a free trial, the current fee for the account type you have selected will automatically and immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date your free trial expires. If your account did not begin with a free trial, the current fee for the account type you have selected will automatically and immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date you signed up and then every 30 or 365 days after (depending on the billing cycle which applies to your account). Fees charged for one account type may not be credited towards other account types. All currency references are in U.S. dollars.**

**Stored Credential Consent Agreement.  This Stored Credential Consent Agreement (“Agreement”) is between Prezi Inc. and its Affiliates and entities (“Prezi”, “we”) and you, the cardholder (“Cardholder” or “you”).**

**This Agreement is an integral part of these Terms (“Terms“) and applies to Cardholders that request Prezi to make recurring payments and to store profile and transaction information including saving credit card information for future purchase during the checkout or payment flow.**

**You hereby acknowledge that Prezi or its PSP will need to store your credit card information, including but not limited to credit card number, expiration date and associated contact and transaction information, in order to process future payments (“Cardholder Data” or “CHD”) and you are hereby providing consent for that storage.**

**Your stored CHD will be used only to process future payment(s) through our payment processor(s). The use of other information that may be contained within the CHD such as your name and email address will only be used as specified in our Privacy Policy.**

**Prezi cancellation and refund policies are detailed herein, the recurring payment can be canceled, in accordance with the provisions in the Terms, through your account detail when logged in or by contacting Prezi Customer Support as stated below.**

### **9.2 Fraud protections**

**To protect against potential fraud, Prezi may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us. The verification process may include debiting an amount between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit card, as well as asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm that you are in possession of your credit card. Prezi will only use this process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the Service. By providing Prezi with your credit card information, you authorize Prezi to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one dollar for such verification purposes. Prezi may also engage third parties to provide fraud detection services.**

### **9.3 Cancelation of subscription**

**Payment for subscriptions is non-refundable. If you cancel your recurring payment option, your account will remain active until its next renewal date. If you delete your account before the end of the term for which you paid, your account will be deleted however your account access will remain active until its next renewal date. In either case (cancellation or deletion), you will not be given any refund.**

### **9.4 Termination**

**If your payment method is invalid or rejected for any reason and a free Prezi Public version of your paid Prezi account type is available, your paid Prezi account will revert to the free Prezi Public account version and will be subject to the limitations of a free Prezi Public account, provided, however, that Prezi reserves the right to cancel your account entirely in such case. You will have the option of deleting any User Content from your account prior to its reversion to a Prezi Public account. In the event your paid Prezi account reverts to a free Prezi Public account, any content you previously created with a paid Prezi account and designated as Private User Content will remain Private User Content, but you will not be able to edit such content. New content you create with such an account will become Public User Content, which means any new content you create from that point forward is going to be public.  
  
If your paid Prezi account began with a free trial and you do not purchase a subscription to the same or an upgraded version of those services before the end of the trial period, your paid Prezi account will automatically terminate at the end of the trial period. If your paid Prezi account is terminated for any reason or expires, any content you entered into the Service, and any customizations made to the Service by or for you, which are associated with your paid Prezi account will become unavailable.  
  
Prezi further reserves the right to cancel, or revert to Prezi Public account status, the account of any user who attempts to fraudulently obtain Prezi educational pricing.**

**18\. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration**  
 
------------------------------------------------------

**Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights.  
  
Most disputes can be resolved informally. If you have a concern, please contact us and include your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. If you reside in the EU, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here:  [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).  
  
In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concern to your satisfaction (or if we haven’t been able to resolve a dispute that Prezi has with you after attempting to do so informally), either of us may bring a formal proceeding.  
  
If you are a U.S. resident, you also agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions:  
  
We each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small-claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision, and in making it you should not rely solely on the information in this agreement. You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by following the instructions below.  
  
Arbitration Agreement:  
(1) Prezi and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and expressly includes claims brought under any statute, regulation, or legal or equitable theory. It includes, but is not limited to:**

* **Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;**
    
* **Claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);**
    
* **Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you aren't a member of a certified class;**
    
* **Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement; and**
    
* **Claims relating to the interpretation of application of this mandatory arbitration provision, including its scope, enforceability, revocability or validity.**
    

**References to "Prezi", "you", "we", and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under this or prior agreements between us.  
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court if its claims are within that court’s jurisdiction and are pending only in that court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Prezi are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.  
  
(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Prezi should be addressed to: Prezi Inc, 101 Broadway, 2nd floor, Oakland, CA 94607 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Prezi and you don't reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Prezi may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Prezi or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Prezi is entitled.  
  
(3) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at [adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.  
  
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  
  
(4) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND PREZI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. Further, unless both you and Prezi agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.  
  
(5) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Prezi makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of these Terms of Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you're agreeing that you'll arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with this provision.  
  
(6) HOW TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION: You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by sending a letter to the Notice Address referenced above, and providing each of the following pieces of information: (a) your full name; (b) your address; (c) your phone number; (d) the URL where you found this agreement; and (e) a clear statement that you wish to opt-out of this arbitration provision.

**19\. General Terms**  
 
--------------------------

**Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the whole legal agreement between you and Prezi. It governs your use of the Service and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Prezi with respect to the Service. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase other products or services from Prezi.  
  
Governing Law. The laws of the State of California, excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Prezi Services.  
  
Severability of Terms; Non-waiver of Terms. If any portion of the Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be stricken and the remainder of the Agreement enforced as written. If Prezi does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy including those contained in the Agreement or arising under applicable law, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of our rights.  
  
Miscellaneous. Both parties are independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. No person or entity not a party to the Agreement will be a third party beneficiary. Our authorized distributors do not have the right to modify these Terms of Service or to make commitments binding on us.**

**19\. Additional Terms**

**High-Risk Use. Except as otherwise set forth in a Prezi Service Description, you understand that the Prezi Services are not designed or intended for use during high-risk activities.  
  
Recording. Certain Services may provide functionality that allows you to record audio and data shared during presentations, webinars or sessions. You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws in the relevant jurisdictions while using any recording functionality.  
  
Assignment. You may not assign your rights or delegate your duties under these Terms of Service either in whole or in part without Prezi’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment by you without Prezi’s consent will be void. Prezi may assign these Terms of Service or delegate its duties hereunder without restriction and without the requirement of prior notice to you.**
