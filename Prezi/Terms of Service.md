Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, including, but not limited to, tort, contract, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, shall Prezi be liable to you or any other person (i) for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character or (ii) for any matter beyond its reasonable control. Prezi's liability for damages of any kind whatsoever arising out of this agreement shall be limited to $50 (U.S.), except where not permitted by applicable law, in which case Prezi's liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by such applicable law. The foregoing limitations shall apply even if Prezi has been informed of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations also apply with respect to Prezi's contractors and agents. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation and exclusion may not apply to you.

‍
