==============

Last updated: _June 3, 2022_

Introduction
------------

Prezi (“Prezi”, “us”, or “we”) and Infogram (“Infogram”, “us”, or “we”) take the privacy of our customers, business partners, shareholders, and employees seriously. We are committed to safeguarding Your privacy while providing You with high-quality solutions.  You will find here the details of our global privacy policy.  Prezi and Infogram have established its data protection and privacy program based on each of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the United Kingdom (UK) GDPR.  As the EU GDPR is the most stringent data protection regulation, we have baselined its program to assure the maximum level of protections of personal data and rights of data subjects.  As local data protection regulations may differ, we do monitor those differences where we operate or have an ecosystem partner. You will find reference to specific regional or local regulations that provide residents of those locations specific rights and require specific handling, as may be applicable, at the end of this document.

‍

This Privacy Policy applies to the [https://prezi.com](https://prezi.com/) and infogram.com website, associated software (including Prezi Desktop, and other apps and services that specifically state that this Privacy Policy applies to them (collectively the “Service(s)” or “Prezi Services” or “Infogram Services”). It excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.  Please note that if you are using Prezi or Infogram within another solution, such as Zoom, Webex, Meet or Teams, the Privacy Policies of those platforms may apply separately to you while we continue to abide by the commitments made herein with regard to your use of Prezi and Infogram.

‍

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you, how we use that information, how you can review or change the personal information you provided to us, when this policy is effective, how we may change this policy, and the steps we take to ensure that your personal information is protected. We share your personal information only with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.

‍

In specific cases, we use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.

‍

Prezi complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Prezi has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  Prezi has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)

_In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Prezi commits to cooperate and comply respectively with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF._

‍

**High Level Overview of our Approach to Privacy**

1. We recognize and respect your privacy.  That means we only collect information we must have to fulfill our commitments and obligations to you.  If we do not need the information, we do not request it.
2. We implement technology solutions (including encryption), process controls, and trained people to secure the data we do collect.
3. We do not sell your personal information – PERIOD.
4. We greatly limit who has access to your personal information to those with a job role that specifically supports a business purpose to support or fulfill our obligations.
5. We do not transact business with minors nor do we use the information of minors for any commercial purposes.
6. We collect information via our website (including our contact form) and via information you provide to us.
7. We have a record retention policy governing how long we retain information.  We only keep your information as long as we need to in order to fulfill our obligations to you and to meet any legal or regulatory requirements we are subject to (ie taxes, know your customer, payroll).
8. This privacy policy addresses all personal information we may collect across customers, partners, employees, etc.  For this reason, you may find some data references that seem odd to you; this is likely because we do not collect that type of information for your category.  For example, we do not collect job history on customers but we do for employees.
9. We do use cookies, primarily those for analytic data that are aggregated (not specific to you).  We may use some cookies to customize your experience; particularly if you have a customer portal or supplier portal account.
10. We honor your rights to; 1) access, correct and delete your data and limit processing of your data; 2) receive personal data so that you can have another processor use it and 3) lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority / data protection authority.

By registering for, downloading, or using the Services, you accept this Privacy Policy and our [Cookie Policy](https://prezi.com/cookie-policy/) , which are part of our [Terms of Service](https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/) .  
  

**The Prezi and Infogram Data Processing Principles**

1. We process your Personal Data in compliance with relevant laws, fairly and in a transparent manner.
2. We process your Personal Data only for legitimate purposes and as described in this Privacy Policy.
3. We make reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Data accurate and up to date.
4. We take reasonable steps to ensure that inaccurate Personal Data is erased or rectified.
5. We keep your Personal Data in a form that enables us to identify you for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which your Personal Data is processed.
6. We process your Personal Data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of your Personal Data, including against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.

‍

Definitions Used in This Privacy Policy

The [Terms of Use](https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/) , together with the other policies and agreements listed therein, are between you and Prezi Inc. or Infogram, as applicable.  In the case of content information you provide (see “Content Information” section below) you control such information, you should be solely liable for it and it is outside our control.

‍

Information you Share
---------------------

‍

### Account Information

You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public presentations. If you do choose to create an account and become a member, you must provide us with some personal information so that we can provide our services to you including your name, email address and/or phone number, occupation, title, and a password. If you choose to authenticate using a third-party account (e.g., Google), you authorize us to obtain account information from the third-party platform.

‍

### Payment Information

In order to gain access to specific premium features within our Services, you must provide us with payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.

‍

### Support Information

The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing.  For example, if you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.

‍

### Survey Information

From time to time, we may ask our registered users or visitors to participate in surveys. These surveys are optional. If you choose to participate, any information you provide to us, including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system. If you would not like your information to be used in this way, you have the option to not participate in surveys or, if you do participate, to provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

‍

### Content Information (User Content)

Parts of our Services allow users to upload, create and stream user content, including presentations, messages, comments, images, videos, and other materials. If you choose to upload personal information through these means in a manner that makes it visible to the public, we will consider that information public and will not limit its use or disclosure in the manner described in this [Privacy Policy](https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/) . 

‍

 You may create a profile and upload content such as presentations, videos, text, photographs, and artwork. Your profile may display information about you and your activities. This information may be accessed by others. Your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed by others, and associated metadata (e.g., titles, descriptions, tags, etc.) are viewable by others. Your interactions with other users (e.g., comments, "likes") may be seen by others. 

‍

We may associate certain content information (such as titles, metadata, and digital art assets) that is stored in your presentations, infographics, videos or other free-form content inputs, such as comments, with personal information about you or others. Information in your presentations, videos, and infographics belong to you, and you are responsible for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. 

‍

If your content is made public, anyone (including us) may view its contents and potentially make other uses of it. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public presentations, videos or other content, such as your name, address, email addresses, and the like, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. If your user content is shared privately, those you have shared it with may use it in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Use, and/or inconsistent with your wishes, including disclosing it publicly. Please exercise discretion concerning those you share your private content with.

‍

Information You Share About Others
----------------------------------

### Contact Information

Some components of the Services allow you and others to share user content and send personal messages with other registered users and non-registered users. To use this feature, you must provide us with personal information about others including an email address for each recipient. For example, when collaborating on a presentation you may want feedback from other team members or non-team members and you can do so by adding those members as collaborators.

‍

Additional Information We Receive About You
-------------------------------------------

### Use of the Services

When you visit our websites, sign in into our Services, interact with our email notifications, or visit a third-party service that includes content from our Services, we may receive information about you, or combine such information with other personal information. This service usage information includes data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited within our Services, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information.

‍

### Third-Party Services

We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect. For example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website. Once on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.

‍

You may use content and/or functionality from third-party services in your presentations, videos and User Content. This Privacy Policy covers our websites and apps, but does not cover any third-party site, content, or app.

‍

### Services you link to your account

We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services, including information from the third party who provides the linked service. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. We also provide options within the Services that enable you to link to services such as Slack and Salesforce, so you can receive real-time notifications and integrate content within those platforms. Our Prezi video feature allows you to upload videos and stream through other platforms. To learn more about these third parties’ privacy practices, please consult their privacy policies.

‍

### Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies

The Services, our service providers, linked services, and third party content and/or functionality that appears on the Services may use cookies and other tracking tools including web beacons, pixel tags, clear GIFs, and the like. Please see our cookie policy for more information about these technologies.

‍

### Our Partners and Service Providers

We rely on a number of other companies, agents, and/or contractors to perform services on our behalf and to assist us in operating and providing the Services to you. For example, we may engage such service providers to provide marketing, communications, website hosting, infrastructure, and IT services, to personalize and optimize the Services, provide customer service, collect debts, and analyze and enhance data. In the course of providing such services to us, these companies may obtain information about you, including personal information, and that information will be shared with us. We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing the services we request from them.

We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If you are a user between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only use our Services through an account established by a parent or guardian, with that parent or guardian’s permission – provided that in your jurisdiction there is no requirement for you or your parent to provide any consent to us for a minor’s use beyond what is already provided in our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By way of example, in some Designated Countries users as old as 16 may be required to have their parent or guardian submit a specific consent to us, and in those countries users under 16 years of age may not use our Services. 

‍

Also, in certain Designated Countries minors at or beyond the age of 13 might be permitted by local laws to give consent directly to their personal data processing parental or guardian permission. We urge you to familiarize yourself with your jurisdiction’s requirements on this subject.

Your Consent to Collect and Use Personal Data
---------------------------------------------

‍

We collect and use Your Personal Data only with Your consent. You may withhold or withdraw Your consent for us to process Your Personal Data. Certain Personal Data is required for Us to provide solutions to You or to meet our legal obligations, and Your withholding or withdrawal of consent to use that Personal Data may prevent us from providing the services and products that You have requested. Other Personal Data is not required for Us to provide services or products to You but is used by Us to provide You with better service or for marketing, communications, and other legitimate purposes as explained in this Privacy Policy.

‍

‍

How we use and process your Personal Data
-----------------------------------------

‍

### General

In most cases, we process your Personal Data to provide you with the Services. However, other purposes may apply, as set forth below. 

‍

We process your Personal Data in compliance with our legal obligations and with this Privacy Policy. We provide an adequate level of protection to your Personal Data by E.U. data protection regulations and standards, even in cases when we transfer your Personal Data outside the Designated Countries, for example by using approved standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules.

‍

The legal bases for processing depend on the services you use and how you use them. We collect and use your information when:

‍

* We need it to provide you the Services and thereby to perform our contractual obligations to you, including to operate and improve the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
* It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and legitimate interests or those of third parties, and to comply with our legal obligations;

Details
-------

We use the information we collect from and about you to:

‍

### Activity Processing

### Provide the Services

Provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, operate and maintain the Services, and to ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance.

‍

### Develop Services and Research

Conduct research and development for the further development of our Services. In particular, we use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.

‍

### Personalize Experiences

Include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing your activities and those of your team to provide better content, notifications, and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. For example, we may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites and/or communications. Where you use multiple Services (e.g., Prezi Desktop, Prezi on the web or mobile device, Infogram), we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant information as you travel across our websites.

‍

### Communicate with you about the Services

Send communications via email, phone and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions, and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.  We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a comment. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.  For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.  We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.  These communications are part of the Services and in most cases, you cannot opt-out of them.  If an opt-out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.

‍

### Market

Send you information or materials via email about products, offers, and news we think might interest you. In specific cases where we have your consent and you have provided us additional contact information, we may contact you through other channels including telephone. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.  We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions, and contests of Prezi Inc., Infogram, or our licensees or selected commercial partners. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Your Choices & Obligations" section.

‍

### Advertise

Target ads to registered users, visitors, and others through a variety of advertising partners. In some cases, we also use information including service usage information, and information from web beacons, pixels, and cookies, and device identifiers that we collect as mentioned above to better understand how to promote and advertise our Services to you. For example, we use Facebook Custom Audiences to promote specific our Services on through Facebook’s ad platform. We do not promote other products or services that are not related to Prezi Inc. or Infogram.

‍

### Provide customer support

Investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and Service issues (e.g., bugs).

‍

### Promote Safety and Security

Verify accounts and activity to prevent, detect and monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies including our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy and/or attempts to harm our Members or Visitors

‍

### Pursue Legitimate Interests and Legal Rights

Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, legitimate interests and those of others, we may use or disclose information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.

‍

### Accomplish other objections, with your consent

We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.  For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.

‍

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.

In order to protect both the Personal Data and the general information that we receive from you through your use of the Services, we have implemented various security measures. For example, when you enter personal information (such as your contact information) on our online forms, we encrypt that information using transport layer security (TLS). We also follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

‍

### Risk of Interception

Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out Personal Data online there is a risk that third parties may intercept and use that Data. While we strive to protect your Personal Data and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. We cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through your use of the Services, and any Personal Data, general information, or other data or information is provided to us at your own risk.

‍

### How Long We Keep Your Information 

As a general rule, we retain your Personal Data for as long as you have an account, and for up to three years thereafter. If you are not a user from a Designated Country, we may retain a back-up copy of your Private or Public User Content potentially with Personal Data in it, indefinitely. We will only retain your information to the extent:

1. it is needed for the purposes which we have conveyed to you;
2. we are required by law to maintain such information; or
3. it is needed for us to address any issues or inquiries that you may have;
4. the processing purpose constitutes a legitimate interest.  
      
    

We dispose of Personal Data by destroying it, erasing it or anonymizing it.

We may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics); your email address; your tax information; communications with you; and your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes). When we no longer have a legitimate business interest in retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.

Once you delete your account, a presentation or a video we may not be able to recover it. If you have previously made a presentation or a video public, the presentation or the video or its parts, including the incorporated data, may still be discoverable via search engines and similar online resources. We have no control over search engines; however, you may send a request for deletion to major search engines in some cases.

If we receive legal process pertaining to your account or have other legal document retention requirements, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with our preservation obligations. Similarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your Personal Data to defend or assert our rights.

‍

Cross-Border Data Transfers
---------------------------

In accordance with the GDPR and other applicable privacy laws, we may transfer your Personal Data from your country of residence to the U.S. (or other countries) and we process data both inside and outside of the United States and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders (e.g. Binding Corporate Rules or Standard Contractual Clauses).

Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may have laws that are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your country of residence. When we share information of our users in the Designated Countries, we make use of each of the European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Data Protection Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.

‍

### Limitation of Liability

* Provide You a different level or quality of goods or services; or
* Suggest that You may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer You certain financial incentives permitted by the applicable data protection regulation that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any regulation permitted financial incentive (currently provided for under the CCPA) we offer will reasonably relate to Your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires Your prior opt in consent, which You may revoke at any time.
