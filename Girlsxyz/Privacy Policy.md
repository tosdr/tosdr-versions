We delete the data as soon as it is no longer required for the processing purpose, a given consent is revoked or other permissions cease to apply. Data that must still be stored, e.g. for reasons of commercial or tax law, or whose storage is still required for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims, will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for aforementioned cases.

### Disclosure of data and payment

In general, no data is passed on to third parties without your consent. However, certain circumstances necessitate the sharing of personal data with third parties, particularly in the context of payment processing.

We have commissioned service providers to process payments. During payment processes, you may be required to provide personal payment information, including your email address and/or phone number. This information may be shared with third-party payment processors and card brands as part of the transaction authorization process. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) — (c) GDPR.

As part of the payment processing provided by the payment processor, the data you enter in the entry field will be transmitted to the payment processor. The email address associated with your Girls.xyz account may be automatically provided to payment processors when purchasing tokens on the platform, in compliance with the requirements set forth by card brands and other payment methods.

By proceeding with the purchase of tokens, you explicitly give your consent for the transfer of your email address and/or phone number to payment processors solely for transaction-related purposes. This sharing of information is necessary for facilitating transactions, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and enhancing payment security.

In some cases, we use processors who process personal data on our behalf and provide it to us as a service. These processors will only share your personal data with us and no other entities or organizations. They will also ensure that necessary technical and organizational measures are taken to process your data securely and will only store your personal data for as long as required by law.

For fraud prevention reasons we can request certain evidence in order to prevent unauthorized use of payment methods. As an example of such evidence can be a photo of identification document and/or payment method. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 (1) (a) — (d). We would like to point out that we are not processing biometric data as we are not using any type of technology to process the abovementioned evidence.

In certain circumstances, we are required by law to transfer and share personal data with third parties. For example, in the context of legal proceedings.

### Data subject rights

Data subjects have the following rights with regards to their personal information:

* The right to be informed about the collection and the use of their personal data (Art. 15 GDPR).
* The right to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or completed if it is incomplete (Art. 16 GDPR).
* The right to erasure (to be forgotten), unless exceptions apply as to why we are still storing the data, for example, retention obligations or periods of limitation (Art. 17 GDPR).
* The right to restrict processing of personal data (Art. 18 GDPR).
* The right to object to processing in the public or legitimate interest (Art. 21 GDPR).

### SSL Encryption

This site uses SSL encryption to ensure the security of data processing and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as login data.

We use this technology to protect your transmitted data.

### Encrypted payment transactions

In order to gain access to the paid services of our website, personal payment information is required as this data is required for payment processing.

Payment transactions using the usual means of payment are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL connection. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

Web analytics

### Google Analytics

On our websites, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 4, D04 V4X7, Ireland (“Google”). In this context, pseudonymized usage profiles are created and cookies (see “Cookies”) are used. The information generated by cookies about your use of this website such as

* browser type/version,
* operating system,
* referrer URL (the previously visited page),
* host name of the accessing computer (IP address) and
* time of the server request,

is transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services related to website activity and internet usage. This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf. In no case will your IP address be merged with other data from Google. The IP addresses are anonymized so that this assignment is not possible (IP masking).

You may decline the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser, however we would like to point out that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

These processing operations are carried out exclusively when explicit consent is given in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.

### Activities in social networks

In order to interact with you on social networks and to inform you about our services, we are represented there with our own pages. If you visit one of our social media pages, we will be jointly responsible for the processing operations triggered by this, within the meaning of Art. 26 GDPR, with the provider of the respective social media platform.

We are not the original provider of these pages, but only use them within the scope of the possibilities offered to us by the respective providers.

As a precaution, we therefore inform you that your data may also be processed outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. The use of social networks may therefore be associated with data protection risks for you, as the protection of your rights (to information, erasure, objection, etc.) may be more difficult and the processing in the social networks often takes place directly for advertising purposes or for the analysis of user behavior by the providers, without us being able to influence this. If usage profiles are created by the provider, cookies are often used, or the usage behavior is assigned to your own member profile on the social networks. Only if you log in to the social network under your personal account, the providers may be able to directly assign the visit to our websites to your profile on the respective social media platform.

The described processing operations of personal data are carried out pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest and the legitimate interest of the respective provider in order to be able to communicate with you in a timely manner or to inform you about our services. If you have to give your consent to data processing as a user with the respective providers, the legal basis refers to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR in conjunction with. Art. 7 GDPR.
