By using any of our Apps, or any services provided through them, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms and conditions ("**Terms of Use**"). These Terms of Use may be updated by us from time to time. We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Apps) before we make material changes to these Terms of Use, unless the changes are required by law. Once any updates to our Terms of Use are in effect, they will apply to you if you continue to use our Apps.

**2\. Basic Terms**

In particular, and without limitation, you must not share any phone numbers, home addresses, e-mail addresses or other personal information on any parts of our Apps that are visible to other users.

6. You may not post offensive, abusive, indecent, obscene, libellous, defamatory, menacing or harmful content.
    
7. You must not abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other users or use another person’s account to gain access to our Apps.

9. You will not distribute or post spam or other unauthorised commercial communication on or through our Apps.
    
10. You must not use our Apps in any way so as to bring us or any other party into disrepute.

We reserve the right to remove content and/or delete your account at our discretion, including if you violate any of these Terms of Use.

**3\. Services**
----------------

The services provided by our Apps (“**Services**”) are mainly the following “**General** **Information Services**”:

* a general information service in the field of mental health, wellbeing for personal and social issues;
    
* a directory and signposting for specialist support services;
    
* written articles and information concerning mental health and wellbeing,
    

and the following peer network service:

* a peer support framework for users to share problems, ideas, experiences, support and solutions with other peers or super-peers (collectively referred to as “**User Content**”).
    

It’s currently free to register for Services, although the cost of connecting to the Internet is the responsibility of users. However, we reserve the right to charge subscription fees for Services, subject to prior approval by users.

Services are not a substitute for consultation with competent health professionals. Users should never, as a result of information read via our Apps, neglect or fail to seek the medical advice of their doctors or of other qualified professionals responsible for their healthcare. It is important to note that we cannot assess the health of individual users using the data they submit via our Apps. In an emergency, users should contact their doctor immediately or call an emergency number such as 999.

Although we make reasonable efforts to regularly update information distributed via our Apps as part of the General Information Services (as distinct from User Content posted or otherwise shared by users), such information is strictly indicative and general in character and cannot be perfectly error-free. The online tools available to users do not in any way constitute a medical device nor an act of telemedicine. Tellmi does not verify or control the content or suitability (including scientific, medical or health plans) of data entered by users. We do not endorse or recommend any specific methodology, advice or procedure, health profession, products or service that may be mentioned on our Apps. Users and third parties use information provided via our Apps at their own risk. 

**4\. Moderation and monitoring**
---------------------------------

All User Content is moderated before going live on Tellmi. The purpose of moderation is to:

* reject content that doesn’t meet our Terms of Use and [Moderation Guidelines](https://www.meetwo.co.uk/moderation-guidelines); and
    
* monitor content for safeguarding concerns.
    

By using Tellmi, you acknowledge and agree to our monitoring as described in these Terms of Use and on Tellmi. Although we endeavour to be rigorous in our moderation, the process cannot always be error-free nor take into account every user’s personal views and beliefs. Tellmi may contain material that you find explicit or offensive posted by users. Please exercise caution when using our Apps for yourself or if authorising the usage for others. We are not responsible for any direct or indirect exposure to explicit content.

If you get asked questions that make you feel uncomfortable, please ignore them or report them to the system administrators. Please do not engage in conversations with people that make you feel uncomfortable in any way.If you are harassed in any way, please report it to our system administrators or other appropriate authorities immediately.

Please note that if we become aware of any incidents of cyberbullying or consider that any individual is likely to cause harm to themselves or other people, we may contact you about our concern or report such incidents to the appropriate authorities or social workers at our sole discretion.

**5\. Users and SuperPeers**
----------------------------

We use the services of paid and volunteer third-parties to act as ‘SuperPeers’ on Tellmi. While we take care to select individuals that we believe will make a valuable contribution to the Tellmi community we do not endorse their individual views and advice. You should not feel under any obligation to follow the advice of any other user or SuperPeer. Any such dealings are solely between you and such individual. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be responsible for any damage or loss incurred as a result of any such dealings.

**6\. Communication**
---------------------

In accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.tellmi.help/privacy-policy), we may contact you via email or through our Apps directly to your device regarding administrative issues, including improvements to our Apps. In addition, Tellmi may send you emails with content from the Tellmi community, such as our newsletters or with suggestions for specific support services that we think might be useful for you; you may opt out of receiving such communications at any point by clicking on the “unsubscribe” links in any of our emails.

**7\. Personal use only**
