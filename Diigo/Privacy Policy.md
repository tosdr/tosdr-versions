Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
