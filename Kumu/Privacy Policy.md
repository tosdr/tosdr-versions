**Last Updated: October 17, 2023**

**Welcome to Kumu!**

**Kumu Privacy Policy (v3.0)****At kumu, as part of our commitment to create a safe space, we are working our best to ensure that your privacy is respected and your Personal Data is protected.** 

**Thus, we want you to take a moment and understand what data we obtain about you and our data privacy practices and policies, so you can make an informed decision and exercise meaningful control over your data.**

**This Privacy Policy will take effect on 20 Nov 2023. For the old version (v2.0) of the policy click [here](https://kumu.ph/privacy-policy-v2/).**

**HIGHLIGHTS** 
===============

You should read our Privacy Policy in its entirety, but here are a few key points we hope you will take away:

* kumu is accessible to the general public from anywhere in the world except in a few countries where the service is unavailable in order for kumu to comply with the law or its company policy.
* When you livestream, create a profile, follow a streamer, give virtual gifts, participate in campaigns or post a clip on kumu that are public or intended to be public in nature, individuals that use kumu will access this information and may have the ability to acquire, use, or reveal such information to others. Furthermore, several of our Services (as defined below) are intended to offer others with information on user behavior, such as virtual gifting or a follow to a streamer. We advise you to keep this in mind when using kumu. However, we also provide non-public communication channels on kumu, such as private streaming and chat.
* When you participate in campaigns sponsored by our Business Partners (i.e. any company or individual which transacts business with Kumu, including but not limited to advertisers and merchants), we may share your Personal Data with them in accordance with the terms and conditions of the campaigns. For example, if you participate in DTI (Philippines) registered campaigns of a Business Partner, we may share your information with DTI (Philippines) as part our legal obligation and with the Business Partner as part of our contractual obligation.
* When you purchase products from our Business Partners, we may share your Personal Data with them to fulfill your orders and to third party service providers for the delivery of your ordered products.
* We collect certain Personal Data (e.g. information regarding the device you’re using, IP address, etc.) from you when you use kumu, even if you’re simply browsing livestreams. We use this information to keep the platform safe and to offer you more relevant content, suggested users and advertisements.
* We want to hear from you if you have any concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, how we collect or use your Personal Data, or anything else relating to our policies or practices at kumu. You are welcome to contact us at any time using the contact details set out at the end of the Privacy Policy.

* **Right to rectification** – to request for amendments to be made to your Personal Data where this is inaccurate or incorrect;

* **Right to object** – to object to the processing of your Personal Data which we carry out in reliance on our legitimate interests. In such instances, we will investigate to see if there is compelling reason for processing to continue.

Also, you can object to marketing communications at any time;
* **Right to withdraw you consent** – to withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data at any time (where kumu is processing your personal information based on your consent). Please note that withdrawing your consent may prevent us from further providing all or part of our Services to you but does not affect the lawfulness of our processing of your Personal Data based on such consent before the withdrawal;
