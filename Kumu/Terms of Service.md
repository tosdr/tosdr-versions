**Last Updated: October 17, 2023**

**Welcome to Kumu!**

**Kumu App Terms of Use (v3.0)**

These Terms of Use will take effect on November 20, 2023. For the old version (v2.0) of the Terms of Use, click [here](https://kumu.ph/terms-of-use-v2/).

These Terms govern your use and access to the Kumu Application and Kumu Website (“Kumu Platform” or “Kumu”), including the communications, features, content, and services of the platforms (“Kumu Service”), except where we expressly state that a different set of terms apply. 

Although we tried to make the Terms reader-friendly, there are still parts that may read like a traditional contract. We believe this is necessary and unavoidable since these Terms actually form a legally binding contract between you and Kumu. Please read these Terms carefully.

We amend these Terms from time to time, for instance when we update the features and functions of the Kumu Service. We will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any important changes to these Terms. For example, we can put a notice on the Kumu website / Kumu App or send you an email. 

In case there will be changes in the Terms of Use, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms. Please note that this is also the date when the updated Terms become effective (“Effective Date”). You should also look at the Terms regularly to check if there are changes in the Terms of Use.

Your continued use of the Kumu Service after the Effective Date means that you accepted the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using the Kumu Service.

The following companies operate the different services offered by Kumu. If you have any questions about these services, please contact us at support@kumu.ph and we will coordinate with these companies for you.

1. Operation of the platform used by Kumu users to create and distribute Content – operated by Kumumedia International Pte Ltd. 
2. Operation of the Virtual Gifting Business – operated by Kumumedia International Pte Ltd.
3. Operation of the Marketplace Business – operated by Kumu, Inc. 
4. Operation of the Advertising Leasing Business for audiences based in the Philippines – operated by Kwentolabs, Inc.
5. Operation of the Advertising Leasing Business for audiences based outside the Philippines – operated by Kumumedia International Pte Ltd.

“We” or “Us” refer to the company that is handling the particular service as described in the Terms.

**Who Can Use the Kumu Service**
--------------------------------

In order to create a Kumu Account and use the Kumu Service, you must be of legal age and you must be allowed by law to enter into a contract with us. If you are using the Kumu Service on behalf of a business, group, or company, you must be authorized to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business, group, or company.

If you are below the legal age, you may only use the Kumu Service with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you. You must also secure the agreement of your parent or legal guardian to be responsible for all of your actions on the Kumu platforms and their consequences.

By using the Kumu Service, you confirm that you accept and you will follow the Terms, Privacy Policy, Politics Free Zone Policy,  Kumunity Guidelines, and other guidelines, policies, or instructions in connection with your use of the Kumu Service (“Additional Policies”). These Additional Policies can be found on the Kumu Platform. We may change these Additional Policies from time to time and your continued use of the Kumu Service means that you accept these changes. 

You also agree that we may change or remove any feature or function of the Kumu Service and some features or functions of the Kumu Service may not be available in some territories or on certain devices. 

We may report any activity we suspect to be in violation of any law or regulations to the appropriate authorities and cooperate with such authority.

We may request any information or data from you at any time if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have failed to provide accurate data.

You are strictly prohibited from impersonating any person or misrepresenting your identity.

You agree that you are responsible for any activity of your Kumu Account. Therefore, it is really important that you keep your password confidential and that you do not disclose it to any third party. If you know or suspect that another person knows your password or has used your Kumu Account, you must inform us immediately at support@kumu.ph.

We have the right to disable your Kumu Account at any time, especially if you failed to follow these Terms, Privacy Policy, Politics Free Zone Policy, or the Kumunity Guidelines. We can also disable your Kumu Account if we discover that your Kumu Account is being used for activities which we think may cause damage to the Kumu Service, violate any rights of other people, or violate any laws.

Please review your Social Media Accounts’ Privacy Settings and Privacy Notice so that you can understand how your Social Media Accounts collect, use, and share your information. We are not responsible for the information used, collected, or shared by your Social Media Accounts.

**Privacy**
-----------

Your privacy matters to us. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data and how we handle your information when you use our Service. You can read more about our Privacy Policy [here](https://kumu.ph/privacy-policy/).

**Virtual Coins, Diamonds, and Gifts**
--------------------------------------

We offer a feature allowing you to purchase coins (“Coins”) for use in the Kumu Platform  and/or (b) virtual gifts (“Gifts”) (Coins and Gifts are collectively referred to as “Virtual Items”). Your purchase of any of the Virtual Items must be made lawfully, under legitimate means, and with real currency. The Coins that you purchased will not expire.

Notwithstanding your purchase or possession of Virtual Items, you acknowledge and agree that the amounts of any Virtual Items do not refer to any credit balance of real currency, e-money, or its equivalent. 

You acknowledge that your purchase and/or receipt of Virtual Items grants you a limited license to use the Kumu Service, including software programs that may manifest themselves as these items, according to the terms and conditions we may provide from time to time. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual currency, e-money, or real currency, nor will you be able to receive a refund of virtual currency, e-money, or real currency for Virtual Items.

You acknowledge that Coins are not a digital currency, security, commodity, or any kind of financial instrument. You can only pay in cash (via authorized payment methods) in exchange for Coins. You are not allowed to accept Coins as payment for goods and services or to discharge (whether partial or full) any form of debt. In case there is a reasonable ground for Kumu to believe that you have breached any of the conditions provided in this section, Kumu reserves the right to immediately restrict you from receiving Coins from other Kumu Users. 

You acknowledge and agree that your distribution of any Gifts currently in your account (i.e. as a virtual “tip” to any other User’s account) may result in some revenue to the recipient Kumu User. You further agree that once you have confirmed a purchase of Coins and/or transfer of a Gift to another Kumu User’s account, the action cannot be undone and the Virtual Item cannot be withdrawn. We make no guarantee or claim that the amount or value of the Virtual Items you may give a Kumu User will correlate to the revenue such a Kumu User may receive.

Your purchase of Virtual Items is a completed transaction upon our confirmation of electronic payment from you via the iTunes App Store, Google Play, or other channels. 

We may deduct Coins from your wallet if we have a reasonable ground to believe that you have obtained the Coins fraudulently or that the sender of the Virtual Item that you received has used Coins obtained fraudulently. In such a case, we will inform you of our decision. If you have concerns, you may reach us at support@kumu.ph. The deduction of the Coins is without prejudice to our other rights and remedies that are provided by these Terms and applicable laws.

Should your access to the Kumu Platform be suspended, limited, or terminated due to your violation of these Terms, we have the right at our sole discretion to exhaust and invalidate any and all Coins in your account, in addition to other remedies available to us under law or contract. 

The price of the Coins, the value (i.e. the exchange rate for Coins) of the Gifts, and the revenue share described are determined by us in our absolute and sole discretion, based on your country of origin. We reserve the right to modify these rates from time to time. 

By your use of the Kumu Service, you confirm your understanding and acceptance of the rates of any Virtual Items which shall be the current rate at the time of your purchase of said Virtual Items.

If you disagree with any part of, or do not fully understand the price of the Coins, or our rate policy, please refrain from purchasing or using any Virtual Items. 

You will be able to monitor your Virtual Items through the Kumu Platform. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding purchases and/or payments regarding the Kumu Platform, please contact us at [support@kumu.ph](https://kumu.ph/terms-of-use/support@kumu.ph) or [coinpurchases@kumu.ph](https://kumu.ph/terms-of-use/coinpurchases@kumu.ph).

**Virtual Diamonds Payouts**
----------------------------

The Gifts that you receive on the Kumu Platform will result in the receipt of virtual diamonds in your Kumu User’s account. 

Any virtual diamonds stored in your account which is equal to or greater than the value of fifty thousand (50,000) diamonds, may entitle you to receive a certain amount in Real Currency. Such amount shall represent your revenue share from the sale of the Virtual Items purchased by Kumu Users using Coins and thereafter given to you (the “Rev Share”). The value of any Real Currency received from any Rev Share shall be determined by the rate at the time of the payout of such Rev Share, which we may set and change from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion. The exchange rate may also change due to the fluctuating price of the Coins, which are subject to change between the time when they were purchased and the time of the payout of the Kumu User’s Rev Share.

Virtual Items given as rewards: There may be instances where we reward you with Virtual Items without any cost to you. You understand and agree that Virtual Items given to you as rewards, or as part of a loyalty or promotional program, may be given subject to certain terms and conditions, including but not limited to expiration dates. 

**User Contests / Campaigns**
-----------------------------

Kumu does not sponsor, administer, organize or endorse any contests or campaigns on the Kumu App unless otherwise announced by Kumu.

The Kumu User must also ensure that all the necessary permits, consents, and/or licenses for the conduct of the User Campaign have been secured.

The inclusion of any Products at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these Products will be available at all times.

When placing an order for a Product or a Service (“Order”), you agree that the Seller has the right to decline or accept your Order. Unless the  Order is accepted by the Seller, the Seller is not required to process your Order. Your Order becomes final upon acceptance by the Seller.

The risk of damage to or loss of the Product shall pass to you at the time of delivery of the Product. You shall not be the owner of the Product delivered to you until we have received the full payment for the Product.

You hereby agree that all such records are admissible in evidence and that you shall not challenge or dispute the admissibility, reliability, accuracy, or authenticity of such records merely on the basis that such records are in electronic form or are the output of a computer system, and you hereby waive any of your rights, if any, to so object.

Miscellaneous: These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Kumu Service.

You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.

Interpretation: Any reference in these Terms of Use to any provision of a statute shall be construed as a reference to that provision as amended, re-enacted, or extended at the relevant time.

Unless expressly indicated otherwise, all references to a number of days mean calendar days, and the words “month” or “monthly” as well as all references to a number of months mean calendar months. Clause headings are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms of Use.
