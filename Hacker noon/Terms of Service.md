We may use Your Content in a number of different ways, including by publicly displaying it, reformatting it, incorporating it into advertisements and other works, creating derivative works from it, promoting it, and distributing it. As such, you confirm and warrant that you own or control all rights to Your Content and hereby grant us world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, assignable, sub-licensable, transferable rights to use Your Content. Please note that you also grant the Users of the Site the right to access Your Content in connection with their use of the Site. Finally, you waive, and cause to be waived, against Company and its Users any claims and assertions of moral right with respect to Your Content.

You are not entitled to any compensation for such advertisements. The manner, mode, and extent of such advertising are subject to change without specific notice to you.
* Affiliate Disclosure: Both User Content and Company Content may contain affiliate links, meaning when you click the links and make a purchase, we, or Users, may receive a commission.

g. Other. User Content (including any that may have been created by Users employed or contracted by Company) does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Company. We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate User Content from time to time at our sole discretion for any reason or no reason, and without notice to you. For example, we may remove a review if we believe it violates our Content Guidelines (set forth below).

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Company and its affiliates and licensors for any breach of the Content Standards. These Content Standards apply to any contributions made by Users on this Site, including Your Content and any User Content. Your Content and any User Content must in their entirety comply with all applicable national, regional, federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for any content you post or actions you take via this site and their consequences. In addition, Your Content and any User Content must not:

* Contain any material which is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable.
* Promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.
* Infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of any other person.
* Violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable laws or regulations, or that otherwise may be in conflict with these User Terms and/or our Policy.
* Be likely to deceive any person.
* Promote any illegal activity, or advocate, promote, or assist any unlawful act.
* Be used to impersonate any person, or to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or organization.
* Involve commercial activities or sales, such as contests, sweepstakes, and other sales promotions, barter, or advertising.
* Give the impression that they emanate from us or any other person or entity, if this is not the case.

i. We Are Not Responsible for Your Content and any User Content. Because the purpose of this Site is to empower you and we cannot review everything that is posted to the Site in advance, any content and/or opinions uploaded, expressed, or submitted to the Site, and all Site Content other than the content officially provided by Company, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity submitting them and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Company. We are not responsible or liable to any third-party for the content or accuracy of any materials posted by you or any other User of the Site, and you agree to bear full responsibility for the content you post to the Site. We also cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any User or third-party.

9\. Enforcement of Terms
------------------------

In order to ensure that the Site is used only for its intended purpose, we have the right to:

* Remove or refuse to post any Site Content for any or no reason. This is a decision Company will strive to make fairly, but ultimately it is a decision that is solely up to Company to make.
* Take any action with respect to any Site Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe that such Site Content violates the User Terms, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right, threatens the personal safety of Users of the Site and the public, or could create liability for Company.
* Disclose your identity to any third-party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy. We will not do this lightly, but if we think it has the potential to facilitate a fair and just resolution of the dispute, or will protect Company from liability for which we are not responsible, we may take this step.
* Take appropriate legal action, including, without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Site when we determine law enforcement is the proper and appropriate means for addressing the offending use.
* Terminate your access to all or part of the Site for any violation of these User Terms.

While we may attempt not to disclose material in response to overzealous or inappropriate requests, without limiting the foregoing, when we have a good faith belief that the law compels us to do so or when we think justice would be served, we may cooperate with law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting any materials on or through the Site. Should this happen, we will attempt to provide you with notice before we disclose your personal information to requesting third-parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe you should have a reasonable expectation of privacy in materials you disclose through your Internet use that are not clearly intended for public dissemination. Where possible, we may attempt to defend this principle even though most jurisdictions currently take the opposite position. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS COMPANY FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY COMPANY DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER COMPANY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.

10\. Links to other Sites
-------------------------

As is typical online, this Site and User posts may contain hyperlinks to other sites. If there are other websites and resources linked to on this Site, either by Company or by you, these links are provided only for the convenience of our Users. We have no control over the contents of those websites or resources, and therefore cannot accept responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the User Terms and conditions of use for such websites.

11.No Guarantee of Service
