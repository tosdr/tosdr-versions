B. Cookies
----------

This website uses cookies, which are small text files that, within the scope of your visit to this website, are transmitted to your browser and are stored by your browser on your computer for later retrieval. You yourself can determine, through settings in your browser, the extent to which cookies can be placed and retrieved. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of the website may be entirely usable.Cookies are used to make the website more user-friendly (so-called "Necessary Cookie"). Without the use of these cookies, the number of unique users on the website cannot be determined, or provide you with certain functions. In addition, cookies are also used for the website presence, which, for example, allows surfing behavior to be analyzed. If cookies are used beyond this, they are expressly mentioned below. Legal basis for the use of cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR unless specified otherwise.

### 1\. Google AdSense for Domains

This website has integrated Google AdSense for Domains. Google AdSense for Domains is an online service which allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites. Google AdSense for Domains (AFD) is an online service that allows the placement of advertising on third party websites. Google AdSense for Domains is based on an algorithm that selects advertising links on the parked page so that they match the domain name of the respective parked website. Google AdSense for Domains (AFD) thus enables a semantic search result.

The operating company of the AdSense component of Google is Alphabet Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.The purpose of the AdSense component is to integrate advertisements or advertising links on the parked websites.

When a user calls up a parked page, a request is sent to the AFD service. Google processes the domain name requested by the user and dynamically returns targeted ads ("sponsored listings"), keywords ("related links") and other page elements, collectively referred to as "AFD results".The first page that the user sees after requesting a parked page is called the "landing page". The landing page may contain related links and/or a search box provided by Google ("Google Search Box"). When a user clicks on a related link or performs a search query through the Google Search Box, that user will be directed to a "results page" that will display a new group of AFD results relevant to the related link or search term. When a user clicks on a sponsored list on the results page, that user will be directed to the ad landing page.

Google AdSense for Domains places a cookie on the individual's information technology system. By setting the cookie, it is possible to show the correct display of content on the parked website. Each time the data subject accesses one of the individual pages of this website operated by the data controller and on which a Google AdSense component has been integrated, the internet browser on the data subject's information technology system is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component to transmit data to Alphabet Inc. for the purposes of online advertising and the billing of commissions. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of the IP address of the person concerned in order to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently to generate commission statements.

You can prevent the installation of Google AdSense for domains cookies by adjusting your browser software accordingly, in particular by suppressing third-party cookies, and thus prevent the setting of cookies. In addition, you can prevent the setting of cookies by permanently disabling Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome in your browsers under the link [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin). Please note that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this offer in full.For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing, as well as further information about your rights and settings to protect your privacy, please contact Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountainview, California 94043, USA; Privacy Policy for Partner Sites: [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

This processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our Internet presence.

### 2\. Conversion Tracking Pixel

On some parked domains the visitor action pixel of the following providers is used for conversion measurement:

* Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook");
* Taboola Inc., 16 Madison Square West, 7th fl., New York 10010, USA ("Taboola");
* Outbrain UK Limited, 5 New Bridge Street, London, EC4V 6JA, UK ("Outbrain");
* Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 90, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA ("Twitter");
* Snap Inc., 63 market Street, Venice, CA 90291, USA ("Snapchat");
* TikTok Inc., 10100 Venice Blvd., Culver City, CA 90232, USA ("TikTok");
* Pinterest Europe Ltd., Palmerston House 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Pinterest");  
    (hereinafter jointly referred to as the "Provider").

By setting the conversion tracking pixel, the behavior of users can be tracked after they have been redirected to the target page by clicking on an advertisement. This procedure is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Provider advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and can help to optimize future advertising measures.

The data collected does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the identity of users. However, the data is stored and processed by the respective Provider so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and the respective Provider can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with its own data protection guidelines. This allows the Provider to enable advertisements to be placed on their website and outside their website. This use of the data cannot be influenced by us as a website operator.

You will find further information on the protection of your privacy as well as the possibility of revoking your consent in the data protection notes of the respective Providers:

The use of visitor action pixels is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR. As a website operator, there is a legitimate interest in effective advertising measures, including social media, in order to optimize both our advertising offer and our interest-oriented design of our online offer.

### 3\. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

We use a Content Delivery Network service on our pages from Cloudflare, Inc. (referred to as the "CDN"):

Cloudflare, Inc., 405 Comal St., Austin, TX 78702, USA, ("Cloudflare")

For the purpose of a shorter loading time of our online presence, we use a so-called Content Delivery Network ("CDN"), in which the website is delivered via web servers from the CDN as a service provider based on a data processing agreement. With the CDN, content from our website such as images, fonts, stylesheets and scripts are delivered to you faster via a network of servers. For this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to the CDN's servers. This way the CDN becomes aware that your IP address, along with any other information that your browser may reveal, has been used to access our website.

The data collected will only be used for the aforementioned purpose and to maintain the functionality and security of the CDN.

Further information can be found:

In Cloudflare's privacy policy: [https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)

The use of the CDN serves to protect our predominantly legitimate interests within the scope of a weighing of interests according to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR in a secure provision and optimization of the online offer.
