MAINE TERMS OF SERVICE



You authorize Energy Rewards, LLC (“Company”), to change your electricity and/or natural gas supplier, as the case may be, to Company and

to supply your home or small business with all the Services you need, subject to the eligibility requirements of your local electric or natural gas

utility (“Utility”). Company is a supplier of energy products. We often use independent brokers to sell our energy products. Please review this

contract carefully. If there are any discrepancies with the product features you were sold and the terms and conditions of such products, please

call our customer care center at 1-844-276-1595. Your Enrollment Documentation, which includes your welcome letter, welcome package, as

applicable, and these Terms and Conditions create your agreement with the Company (“Agreement”) and supersedes any oral or written statements

made in connection with this Agreement or the supply of your Services. Capitalized terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them as

listed within the Agreement as well as in the “Definitions” section herein.



1. SERVICES. Upon successful completion and receipt of all

customer enrollment requirements, Company will supply Services for

your home or small business. Company is a retail marketer of

Services and is not your Utility. Your Utility will continue to deliver

Services to your home or small business, read your meter, send your

bill and make repairs and charge you for its services related to

delivering your commodities. Your Utility will also respond to

emergencies and provide other traditional utility services. You

understand that you are not required to switch your Services to

Company and that your Utility offers standard generation service for

consumers that do not wish to obtain services from a supplier. This

Agreement is subject to the eligibility requirements of your Utility

and Company may choose not to accept this Agreement for any

reason. If you are enrolled in any Utility or government programs,

enrolling with Company may impact your participation in these

programs. Please check with your Utility or program administrator

before enrolling with Company.

2. TERM. Company will begin supplying your Services when the

Utility switches your account to Company. Your Agreement will

continue for the Term specified in the Enrollment Documentation or

herein, and if applicable for the Renewal Term. Your Term is based

on monthly billing cycles as determined by your Utility and each

monthly billing cycle may not represent a full calendar month. If your

Utility bills bimonthly, Company will treat this as two monthly billing

cycles. Typically it takes one to two billing cycles for your Service

to be switched from your Utility to the Company, but there may be a

delay before the Utility switches Services and you understand that

Company is not responsible for any such delays. You may receive

written notification from your Utility confirming your switch to

Company. The Company may terminate this Agreement by providing

you notice as required by law.

3. PRICE. Company does not charge any fee for you to switch from

your utility to Company. Please note that some products have specific

fees related to the product or plan you choose which are detailed in

your product Enrollment Documentation; these fees are not switching

fees. Each month you will pay for the Services you consume. For

electricity, your bill will be calculated by multiplying your Rate by

the amount of electricity you consumed in kilowatt- hours during the

billing cycle, plus any applicable Fees. For natural gas, your bill will

be calculated by multiplying your Rate by the amount of natural gas

you consumed in mcfs, ccfs or therms, as applicable, during the

billing cycle, plus any applicable Fees. Depending on your Utility’s

billing practices, your Rate during the billing cycle may be applied

pro rata, resulting in a blended rate of



the previous month and the current month Rate. If your price is based

on an estimated usage for such Services, the Company has the right

to bill you on actual usage when such information is made available

and you have the obligation to pay Company for such actual usage

amounts.

4. RATE PLAN OPTIONS.

a. Fixed Rate. If you selected a fixed rate, the Rate for your Service

is the Rate indicated in your Enrollment Documentation for the Term

(“Fixed Rate”).

b. Variable Rate. If you selected a variable rate, the Rate for your

Service for your first billing period is the Rate indicated in your

Enrollment Documentation (“Variable Rate”). Variable Rates change

at the Company’s discretion. Variable Rates are set in the Company’s

discretion and may vary based on numerous factors, including, but not

limited to, the Company’s assessment of applicable market conditions,

operation costs, historic and projected supply and hedging costs, prior

meter read cycle’s pricing and balancing costs, projected customer

bill amounts and Utility pricing or “price to compare” and applicable

pricing reset dates and may include the following additional costs:

ancillary services and other ISO costs, capacity costs, transmission

costs, line loss costs, RMR costs, credit costs, balancing costs, winter

reliability costs, and costs associated with meeting any applicable

renewable portfolio standards, and a profit margin determined in the

Company’s discretion that may vary from month to month. Your

Variable Rate will not include taxes, which will be assessed

separately, and will not include any fees, taxes or charges directly

assessed by the Utility or any other third party with the right to assess

taxes or fees for the Services. Variable Rates are not determined based

on a formula or market indices, and there is no limit on how high

Variable Rates may go.

c. Index Rate. If you selected an index product, the Rate for your

Service will be the index and the adder indicated in your Enrollment

Documentation and will vary in accordance with the terms of the

specific index (“Index Rate”).

d. Understanding and Selecting Rates. You understand that unless

you have been offered a Rate confirmed in writing by the Company

that expressly provides otherwise, there are no guaranteed savings and

your Rate may be higher or lower than the Utility’s rate in any given

month. You can always review existing Service offers to compare

your Rate under this Agreement to other current offers by going to

your state’s public rate chart. You can review your Utility’s available

rates by visiting: http://www.maine.gov/mpuc/electricity/

standard_offer_rates/index.html.

payment due date and the payment address. Any bill not paid in full

by its due date will incur a late payment fee in accordance with the

Utility’s or the Company’s billing and payment policies and

procedures. You may be liable for the costs the Company incurs if

Company must terminate your Services for failure to pay, such as

collection costs or attorney fees. Company shall have the right to

setoff and net against any undisputed amounts owed by you under this

Agreement, and the Company shall additionally have the right to

setoff and net against any deposit or security provided by you

pursuant to this Agreement any amounts, charges or damages owed

by you to Company. If you have provided Company, its affiliates or

agents with a credit card number, you provide authorization to charge

any outstanding balance to such credit card. You will be billed and

pay Company for the Services based on meter readings, estimated

meter readings as applicable, and consumption information that

Company receives from your Utility (“Billing Quantity”). For



commercial accounts, Company will have the option to adjust the

Billing Quantity for fuel and line loss retained by your Utility and

interstate transporters from the Purchased Quantities. You are

responsible for paying and reimbursing Company for all applicable

Fees. If you are tax exempt, you must furnish Company an exemption

certificate before your Services commence.

10. DISPUTE PROCEDURES RESOLUTION AND

MANDATORY AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ON AN

INDIVIDUAL BASIS. If you have billing questions or would like to

make an inquiry about the Company’s terms of service, you may

contact the Company as indicated in Section 14. In the event of a

after discussing your dispute with Company, or if you have any

questions about consumer protection rights you may contact the

Maine Public Utility Commission at 1-800-696-1000.

Regardless of whether you choose to pursue your dispute with the

Maine Public Utility Commission, your right to pursue individual

3 CCI_ME_ResSc_202208



arbitration with the Company will not be impacted under this

Agreement as set forth below.

You and the Company both agree to resolve Disputes (as defined

below) only by arbitration or in small claims court (for qualifying

claims), subject to specific exceptions listed herein. The parties

expressly agree that they are waiving their right to sue in court and

that arbitration is the parties' sole remedy to resolve disputes. There

is no judge or jury in arbitration, the procedures may be different, and

it is subject to very limited review by a court. An arbitrator, however,

can award you the same damages and relief, and must honor the same

terms in this Agreement, as a court would. If the law allows for an

award of attorneys' fees, an arbitrator can award them too. In addition,

you and the Company also both agree that:

(a) “Disputes” are any claims or controversies against each other

related in any way to, or arising from the Company’s Services, this

Agreement, or any related agreements, including but not limited to,

billing, services and practices, policies, contract practices (including

enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if it

arises after your Services with the Company have terminated.

Disputes include any claims that: (i) you bring against the Company

or any of its employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives;

(ii) you bring against a third party that are based on, relate to, or arise

from the Company’s Services, this Agreement or any related

agreements; or (iii) that the Company brings against you. It also

includes, but is not limited to, claims related in any way to, or arising

from any aspect of the relationship between you and the Company,

whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or

any other legal theory.

(b) Except as otherwise provided under Section 10(f) below, the

Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) applies

exclusively to this agreement to arbitrate, and this agreement to

arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. The arbitrator’s

decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under

the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with

jurisdiction.

(c) Prior to initiating arbitration, a party must first send to the other,

by certified mail, a written notice of dispute (“Dispute Notice”). The

Dispute Notice to the Company should be addressed to the Notice

Address listed in Section 14. The Dispute Notice must (i) describe the

nature and basis of the claim or Dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific

relief sought (“Demand”). If the Company and you do not reach an

agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the

Dispute Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an

arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any

settlement offer made by the Company or you shall not be disclosed

to the arbitrator.

(d) Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitration will be

conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and will take place in the

county (or parish) of the service address.

(e) The arbitration will be conducted by: (i) a neutral third party

arbitrator mutually agreed upon by you and the Company; or (ii) the

American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). The arbitration will

be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the

Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes

(collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the AAA, as modified by this

Agreement. Where the terms of this agreement to arbitrate conflict

with the AAA Rules, the terms of this agreement to arbitrate shall

override and govern. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org,

by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice



Address for the Company, which is listed in Section 14. The arbitrator

is bound by the terms of this agreement to arbitrate. All issues are for

the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and

enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.

If your claim is for $10,000 or less, the Company agrees that you may

choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis

of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic

hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.

If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be

determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which

the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned

written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and

conclusions on which the award is based. Upon your request, and you

supplying appropriate documentation, the Company will reimburse

your administrative costs for the arbitration over and above the costs

associated with filing a case in court. If, however, the arbitrator finds

that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the

Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured

by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),

then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow you or the

Company to arbitrate on a class-wide, representative or consolidated

basis. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply

exclusively to the specific case. The arbitration award and judgment

cannot be used for any other case except to enforce the award itself.

You and the Company each agree that arbitration will only be

pursued on an individual basis, and will not be pursued on a

class-wide, representative or consolidated basis. This Agreement

does not allow class, representative or collective arbitrations even

if the AAA procedures or rules would. If for any reason any

court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable

or unenforceable, then this agreement to arbitrate does not apply

and the dispute must be brought in court.

(f) You and the Company agree that notwithstanding this agreement

to arbitrate, either party may bring qualifying claims in a small claims

court. In addition, this arbitration provision does not prevent you

from bringing your dispute to the attention of federal, state, or local

government agencies (including the Maine Public Utility

Commission), and if the law allows, they can seek relief against the

Company on your behalf.

(g) If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through

arbitration, you and the Company agree that there will not be a jury

trial. You and the Company unconditionally waive any right to trial

by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or

relating in any way to this Agreement or the Services provided by the

Company. In the event of litigation, this paragraph may be filed to

show a written consent to a trial by the court.

11. EMERGENCY. In the event of an emergency such as a power

failure, a downed power line, or a natural gas leak, you should call

your Utility. If your Utility is Emera Maine, call 1-855-363-7211;

Central Maine Power, call 1-800-696-1000. You can also call your

local emergency personnel at 911 if the emergency warrants.

12. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND WARRANTY.

NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE

OTHER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY

CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL

OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM A BREACH OF

THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

4 CCI_ME_ResSc_202208
